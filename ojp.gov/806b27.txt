NCJ Number 228106 Journal Violence Against Women Volume: 15 Issue: 8 Dated: August 2009 Pages: 952-976 Date Published August 2009 Length 25 pages Annotation This study examined the relationship between community attitudes toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals. Abstract Findings of the study address the experiences and needs of LGBTQ survivors of sexual violence. Participants believe that sexual violence is a problem within the LGBTQ community, and that prevention efforts tailored to the community are needed. Findings confirm the issues of an overall discrimination and misunderstanding toward and about the LGBTQ community and their impact on the response to sexual violence, intervention, and prevention; the lack of public discussion of these issues; and gaps and barriers in public services for LGBTQ persons. Data were collected through a survey and during focus group interviews. Data were analyzed separately, with survey findings leading to focus group questions. Tables, figure, notes, and references
