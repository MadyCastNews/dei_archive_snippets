Substance Use Disorder affects the LGBTQ+ community at a higher rate than the general population. Unique challenges such as stigma, shame, and lack of support can impede access to treatment. Mid-America ATTC consultant Darla Belflower has developed resources to highlight best practices for working with this population. "It's important to create a welcoming and accepting environment, reduce stigma, and tailor treatments to the needs of LGBTQ+ individuals. Abstinence-based recovery may be key for some, whereas harm-reduction strategies may be more appropriate for others."Darla Belflower Darla Belflower LCSW, CPS has worked in leadership in the substance use disorder and behavioral health fields for over three decades.
