December/January 2025Vol. 25, No. 10Affirming Transgender, Nonbinary, and Gender-Diverse Youth in Out-of-Home Systems A new course from the Center of Excellence on LGBTQ+ Behavioral Health Equity discusses Safe Havens II, an interactive report that elevates the voices of seven transgender, nonbinary, and gender-diverse youth with lived experience in the child welfare, juvenile justice, and youth homelessness systems and their recommendations for meaningful systems change. The course, from the Center's Ask-Our-Expert series, consists of an 80-minute recorded webinar featuring a panel discussion among Safe Havens II collaborators, including several of the TNGD youth upon whose valuable insights the report was centered, about the challenges this marginalized population faces and how policymakers and allies can better support these youth. The report and webinar are the result of a collaboration between the Center for the Study of Social Policy, Childrenâ€™s Rights, Lambda Legal, and Unicorn Solutions. A general, noncredit certificate of attendance is available to participants who view the full recording and complete an evaluation. An overview of this course and other recorded learning opportunities are available on the Center's website.
