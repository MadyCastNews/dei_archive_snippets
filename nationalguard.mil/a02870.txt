National Guard Bureau McClanahan, a public affairs specialist, joined the Guard in 2015 and was part of the COVID-19 pandemic response in Maryland. She traveled frequently to Maryland National Guard partners Estonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of the State Partnership Program. McClanahan says diversity is one of the great strengths of the United States. "Pride Month is a reminder that there is a community out there, just like me, that sees you and supports you. For me, finding that community was life-changing, and watching the world grow into a more accepting, loving place gives me hope for those who come after me."
