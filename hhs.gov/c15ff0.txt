February 2014Vol. 15, No. 2T&TA Network Resources on LGBTQ Issues Children and youth who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) often face unique challenges as they grow into adulthood. This can particularly be the case for children who receive child welfare services. The Children's Bureau's Training and Technical Assistance (T&TA) Network is committed to providing professionals with tools to help them better serve these youth, as well as tools to help LGBTQ youth themselves face the difficulties they meet head on and grow into healthy, happy adults. The T&TA Network also provides many resources for LGBTQ adults who are interested in becoming foster and adoptive families for children in care. To learn more about LGBTQ issues and child welfare, explore the following T&TA Network resources: Child Welfare Information Gateway Publications: Frequently Asked Questions From Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) Prospective Foster and Adoptive Parents: https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/factsheets/faq_lgbt.cfm Supporting Your LGBTQ Youth: A Guide for Foster Parents: https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/LGBTQyouth.cfm Working With Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) Families in Adoption: https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/f_profbulletin/f_profbulletin6.cfm Web: Adoption by Family Type: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) Families: https://www.childwelfare.gov/adoption/adoptive/glbt_families.cfm Working With LGBTQ Youth and Families: https://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/cultural/families/lgbtq.cfm Working With LGBTQ Youth in Out-of-Home Care: https://www.childwelfare.gov/outofhome/casework/children/lgbtq.cfm -
