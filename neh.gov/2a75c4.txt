LGBTQ+ Histories of the United States is a two-week summer institute for middle and high school teachers that introduces participants to the rich body of recent scholarship covering the span of U.S. history, from early America to the 1990s, and engages sources suited for classroom use, including news media, government records, oral history interviews, literature, and art and photography. The institute is in hybrid format: 1 week online, 1 week in-person. Each day prominent guest scholars join participants for a full day of conversation and hands-on workshops. The institute schedule includes a walking tour and on-site sessions at the Lesbian Herstory Archives, New York Public Library, and the LGBT Community Center.
