During the month of June, the National Marine Sanctuary System celebrates Ocean Month and LGBTQ Pride Month through #PrideInTheOcean. In collaboration with Pride Outside, this social media campaign asks LGBTQ community members to share an image of themselves with a caption of why and how they take pride in the ocean. Here are a few of the participants.
