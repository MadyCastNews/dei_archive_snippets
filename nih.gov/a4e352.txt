We have updated some blog posts with more recent links and helpful articles. Here are a few to check out, in addition to the OITE blog posts below. STEM and LGBTQA+ Resource Guide from Arizona State University - LGBT Science and Research Resources from the Society for the Psychology of Sexual orientation and Gender Diversity - Report card published by the Medical Student Pride Alliance for LGBTQ support and equity initiatives at 30+ medical schools - Nature Articles “Be kind to yourself”: an interview with Sebastian Groh on being a transgender early career scientist during a global pandemic “Turning point: Empathetic outreach” **** LGBTQ Employment and Training Opportunities: In addition to the helpful employment resources referred to in the in the 2014 Happy Pride blog, here are some additional resources: National Organization of Gay and Lesbian Scientists and Technology Professionals (NOGLSTP). A professional association that provides a listing of career opportunities for LGBTQ science and technology graduates, mentoring, fellowships, and other forms of support. New Scientist has published a useful article highlighting LGBT employers in the sciences. GoAbroad.com published an article with links to an excellent on-line LGBT Student Guide to Studying Abroad that provides resources and helpful information that will help LGBT community members prepare to go abroad for studies. The guide is also useful for international applicants seeking knowledge about LGBT safe communities across the world. PFLAG International extends its advocacy for LGBT individuals and families globally. This is a useful resource for LGBT individuals and allies who are preparing to go abroad for short or extended periods of time. Preferred Gender Pronouns: When applying for internships, jobs, graduate school, and/or professional schools, you may notice a question related to gender pronouns is added. This question allows applicants an option to request their preferred gender pronouns to use when referring to them. Colleges, universities, and human rights organizations provide excellent resources used in ally trainings for students, faculty and staff about using gender neutral pronouns. Ally Training: Many organizations (including the NIH Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion) offer Safe Zone training that can allow allies the opportunity to learn more about the LGBTQ community and assist in the creation of a more welcoming environment. LGBTQ Terminology: One way to contribute to a culture of inclusion and respect for community members is to become aware of accepted terms to refer to members of the LGBTQ community. The human rights organization, PFLAG, publishes a terminology glossary that is a useful reference to learn about the latest acceptable terms. As you can see, it is important for job seekers and their allies to address LGBTQ-related topics in order to keep stress from derailing their life, job search, and/or educational process. The OITE offers career development workshops and/or career, wellness, and pre-professional services. We suggest that you learn when to seek counseling from our office or the NIH Employee Assistance Program. We encourage you to register for the Workplace Dynamics: Diversity in a Multicultural Society workshops and/or join the NIH LGBT Fellows and Friends (LGBT-FF) community. Not at NIH? We recommend using resources offered by your college and university or local community centers. It can be helpful to chat with other professionals who have been through this process to seek advice and support. Out for Work and Out and Equal Workplace Advocates are two good introductory resources.
