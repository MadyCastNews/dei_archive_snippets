Creating Safe Schools for LGBTQ+ Youth Core Competencies for Professional Development This brief provides key learning objectives that schools and school districts can incorporate in their PD offerings to help teachers and other school staff build core competencies for supporting LGBTQ+ youth in schools. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ+) youth are more likely than non-LGBTQ+ youth to experience violence at school and have lower levels of school connectedness. Professional development (PD) for teachers and other school staff on how to support LGBTQ+ youth is a best practice for improving safety and connectedness in schools for both LGBTQ+ youth and their cisgender, heterosexual peers. Learning Objectives Learning Objective 1: Describe the Basics Understanding how sexual orientation and gender identity are defined and how the two differ is the first step in building a safe and supportive environment for LGBTQ+ youth. By knowing and applying these concepts, teachers and other school staff can help LGBTQ+ youth feel more welcomed at school.

Teachers and other school staff can build knowledge and awareness around what factors within schools have the potential to cause harm and what factors could help prevent some of these health risks. Risk Factors in Schools Risk Factors in Schools Define risk factors - Identify risk factors which primarily occur in school environments - Describe how school-based risk factors impact LGBTQ+ youth - Define risk factors - Identify risk factors which primarily occur in school environments - Describe how school-based risk factors impact LGBTQ+ youth - Protective Factors in Schools Protective Factors in Schools Define protective factors - Identify protective factors which primarily occur in school environments - Describe how school-based protective factors impact LGBTQ+ youth - Define protective factors - Identify protective factors which primarily occur in school environments - Describe how school-based protective factors impact LGBTQ+ youth - Learning Objective 4: Implement Supportive Policies & Practices Teachers and school staff can promote positive changes within school environments that address health disparities and help LGBTQ+ youth thrive in schools.

Curricula Curricula School Policies School Policies Identify examples of LGBTQ+-inclusive school policies - Describe how school staff can enact change within their school communities - Identify examples of LGBTQ+-inclusive school policies - Describe how school staff can enact change within their school communities - Success Story From 2015 to 2017, the American Psychological Association (APA) partnered with education agencies to implement an in-person professional development workshop, developed with CDC support, on supporting LGBTQ+ studentsâ€”RESPECT Workshop. State education agencies in Illinois, Mississippi, New Mexico, and Vermont participated in data collection before and after the workshops. After completing the workshop, 100% of survey respondents reported promoting school policies, programs, and practices for a safe and supportive school environment. These respondents reported significant increases in knowledge, skills, and confidence in their abilities to promote safe school environments; motivate students to prevent HIV, STDs, and pregnancy; and assist LGBTQ+ students in coping with specific challenges.
