Roshanda Spillers is a lifelong student. With five academic degrees under her belt and more to come, she’s one of the vital lab staff who make sure that the experiments’ electronics are in working order and that the particle accelerators are well-maintained. A new grandmother who’s learning piano while going to school, she encourages those who love science to pursue their dreams relentlessly. diversity equity and inclusion From Donne e Scienza, Feb. 5, 2021: In this interview, Fermilab scientist Anna Grassellino talks about quantum computing, her career trajectory, and women and girls in STEM. Three physicists share their experiences learning and communicating physics in a foreign language: English. Because of English’s hegemony in science and the world, aspiring scientists in non-English-speaking countries must learn English in school to pursue a career in science. In some cases, science classes are even taught entirely in English. From Wired, July 14, 2020: Companies and universities have long relied on seminars to reduce racism, despite lackluster results. Maybe institution leaders can salvage the format. Fermilab scientist Brian Nord weighs in on the value of certain diversity-centered activities at academic institutions. From DOE, June 18, 2020: It’s Pride Month, and several national laboratories have employee resource groups to advance LGBTQ+ individuals equality, inclusion and diversity in the workplace. Fermilab physicist Erica Snider, a member of the LGBTQ+ laboratory resource group Spectrum and the lab’s Scientist Advisory Council, will participate in the panel discussion on June 23 called “A Day in the Life: A Panel Discussion about LGBTQ+ inclusion.”
