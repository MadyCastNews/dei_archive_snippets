Wednesday, June 22, 2022 EdNC The first week Ethan Jones attended a Gay-Straight-Transgender Alliance (GSTA) meeting at Sandhills Community College, he was the only student there. “I wanted to get more involved with the community,” said Jones, who is now the club’s president. “Because I hadn’t really met any other gay people until the meeting.” The next week, another student joined Jones. Together, they worked to advertise the club so more people would come. A few weeks later, the club had more than 10 regular attendees.
