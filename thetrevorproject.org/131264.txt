TrevorSpace helps young people explore their identities, get advice, find support, and make friends in a moderated community intentionally designed for them. Only 1 in 3 LGBTQ+ youth have found their home to be LGBTQ+-affirming. With TrevorSpace, LGBTQ+ young people can build an online support network by meeting new friends, joining clubs, sharing hobbies, getting advice, and starting discussions with a group of like-minded people. With TrevorSpace, LGBTQ+ young people can safely explore their identities and express their feelings anytime, anywhere. From coming out to getting advice, TrevorSpace creates a place where young people can be their authentic selves and feel like they belong. The Trevor Project is dedicated to growing TrevorSpace as a respectful and affirming place where LGBTQ+ young people around the world can make friends and learn more about themselves. With our team of online moderators and AI-technology keeping the site secure, young people can log on to TrevorSpace with peace of mind. Many LGBTQ+ young people face barriers to receiving the support they need. With TrevorSpace, young people can access helpful resources, connect with other young people in similar situations, and get advice from peers on the topics most relevant to them. For LGBTQ+ young people in crisis, our phone, text, and chat services are also available 24/7.
