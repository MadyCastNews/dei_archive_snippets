This program provides training and technical assistance to juvenile justice practitioners to assist them in meeting the needs of justice-involved LGBTQ+ and Two-Spirit youth to ensure that contact with the juvenile justice system is rare, fair and beneficial. Improving outcomes for LGBTQ+ and Two-Spirit youth requires a coordinated, collaborative approach in providing competent training and technical assistance that will build capacity among OJJDP's current training and technical assistance providers, develop and disseminate resources (e.g., fact sheets, toolkits, online curriculums, webinars, training and guidance manuals, etc.), and respond to requests from justice-involved youth stakeholders including, but not limited to juvenile detention center staff, law enforcement officers, judges and court staff, probation staff, and community-based providers. This project will support the development and implementation of resources to inform justice systems policies, practices, and/or programs that address the needs of, and improve outcomes for, justice-involved LGBTQ+ and Two-Spirit youth.
