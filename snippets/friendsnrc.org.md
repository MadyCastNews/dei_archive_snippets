May 2024 Peer Learning Call: There’s Nothing Like Home – The Youth Acceptance Project [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://friendsnrc.org/resources/may-2024-peer-learning-call-theres-nothing-like-home-the-youth-acceptance-project/)

> This Peer Learning Call (PLC) provides information regarding an Alameda, CA based program which helps support LGBTQ+ youth and their families. The Youth Acceptance Project (YAP) is a unique and innovative program developed to meet the needs of LGBTQ+ youth by working with families, kin or fictive, who are struggling to support or affirm them. This intervention reduces the time LGBTQ+ youth spend in foster care, and often prevent separation in the first place. The YAP partners with families to address the fear, grief, guilt, and misinformation families experience when they find out their child is LGBTQ+.
