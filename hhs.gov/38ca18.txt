June 2024Vol. 25, No. 5New Training on Adapting Family Finding and Engagement Practices for LGBTQ+ Youth A new online training from the National SOGIE Center provides information on supporting young people who identify as LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, or other gender or sexual identity) during family finding and engagement processes. The free, 45-minute training provides information on supporting these young people and helping the adults in their lives understand and support them as well. Having a solid support network and lifelong connections is essential for all youth and young adults, especially those in and aging out of foster care. Young people in care who identify as LGBTQ+ may need additional support forging new connections and nurturing existing relationships due to unique stressors, such as disclosing their LGBTQ+ identity. In addition, the adults in their lives may need guidance on how to best support and affirm these young people. The training is provided by the National SOGIE Center and the National Quality Improvement Center on Tailored Services, Placement Stability, and Permanency for LGBTQ2S Children and Youth in Foster Care and is available on the National SOGIE Center website. The SOGIE Center offers a series of other trainings related to supporting LGBTQ+ youth, such as a training on creating affirming environments, best practices, and proper terminology.
