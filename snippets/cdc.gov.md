### [APA’s Respect Workshop: Improving School Support for LGBTQ Students](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/stories/DASH-Success-Stories-APA.htm)


> APA’s Respect Workshop: Improving School Support for LGBTQ Students For LGBTQ students to thrive in their schools and communities, they need to feel socially, emotionally, and physically safe and supported. APA’s Respect Workshop is effective at improving school staff support for LGBTQ students. The American Psychological Association’s (APA) Respect Workshop, developed with CDC support, provides school staff with the knowledge, attitudes, and skills to make schools safe and supportive for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) students. The workshop teaches school counselors, nurses, psychologists, and social workers about direct services they can provide to LGBTQ students. It promotes implementing school-wide protective practices to address school climate, peer and family support, access to school and community health resources, and inclusive sexual health education. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual students experience increased health and safety risks More than 60% have been so sad or hopeless they stopped doing some usual activities. - Nearly 50% report seriously considering suicide. - More than 20% report attempting suicide in the last year. - 10% have missed school because of safety concerns. - * Kann L, McManus T, Harris WA, Shanklin SL, Flint KH, Queen B, et al. Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance—United States, 2017. MMWR Surveill Summ. 2018;67(8):1-114. Providing support at multiple levels helps all students thrive Individual-level protective factors include helping young people develop problem-solving and coping skills and encouraging bystander interventions. - Family-level protective factors include family support and connectedness, connection to other caring adults, and connection and commitment to schools. - Community-level protective factors include community support and connectedness and access to mental health and substance use services. - APA puts the Respect Workshop to the test to promote protective factors From 2015 to 2017, APA partnered with education agencies to implement an in-person Respect Workshop. The participating state education agencies included Delaware, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Illinois, Mississippi, New Mexico, and Vermont. State education agencies in Illinois, Mississippi, New Mexico, and Vermont participated in data collection before and after the workshops. 100% of survey respondents reported promoting school policies, programs, and practices for a safe and supportive school environment after completing the Respect Workshop A total of 150 pre-surveys and 114 post-surveys were collected from Illinois, Mississippi, New Mexico, and Vermont representing 28 districts covering over 90,000 students. After attending the Respect Workshop, school staff are better equipped to address students’ needs All survey respondents—100%—reported that they had promoted school policies, programs, and practices to maintain a safe and nurturing climate for all students since completing the Respect Workshop. Respondents reported significant increases in both knowledge and skills, and confidence in their abilities, to promote safe school environments, - motivate students to prevent HIV, STDs, and pregnancy, and - assist LGBTQ students in coping with specific challenges. - For example, the workshop teaches that students are always looking for safe, supportive people. Survey respondents indicated that after the workshop, they made their support for LGBTQ students more visible by displaying stickers, posters, and resources in their office. Follow-up data were collected from 16 respondents 3 to 4 months after they completed the Respect Workshop. Respondents reported that they were still taking action. Multiple respondents reported on efforts to start or support more engagement with gender sexuality alliances (GSAs). - Several respondents described taking steps to review and reconsider gender-based graduation gowns. - Respondents reported reaching out to LGBTQ rights organizations in their state, either as a referral resource or to share information at a school forum. - Respondents reported continuing to display Respect Workshop resources, stickers, and posters in their offices. -
### [Affirming the Experiences of LGBTQ Students, Families, and Staff](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/stories/sps_wa.htm)


> Affirming the Experiences of LGBTQ Students, Families, and Staff Seattle Public Schools, Washington State Seattle Public Schools increased the safety and supportiveness of schools by developing a book that highlights the stories of LGBTQ+ students, disseminating it throughout the district, and incorporating it into staff training, classroom education, and family engagement. Seattle Public Schools is highlighting the strength, resilience, and unapologetic pride of queer and transgender students in their district through the creation of a book and photo exhibit. Our Students, Their Stories: Celebrating LGBTQ+ Students, Families, and Staff showcases the images and stories of LGBTQ+ students, their families, and staff, and captures the many ways in which students thrive with the support of loving family members. The book also spotlights LGBTQ+ staff members who uplift queer and transgender youth. In October of 2020, more than 200 community members visited a “pop-up” exhibit held at a local park that showcased the book and stories. The photo book and exhibit will be used as educational tools for staff training, classroom education, community engagement, and parent education. Seattle Public Schools is also incorporating the book into students’ learning by developing grade-level lesson plans. A copy of the book will be available in the library at every school, as well as in the offices of school counselors, school nurses, and school-based health centers. These activities will increase inclusivity throughout the district, positively impacting more than 53,000 students who attend Seattle Public Schools. School policies and practices designed to support LGBTQ+ youth reduce risk and negative experiences for all youth. Through the development, dissemination, and teaching of Our Students, Their Stories, Seattle Public Schools is not only making their school environments safer and more supportive for LGBTQ+ youth throughout the district, but for all youth in the district.
### [Creating Safe Schools for LGBTQ+ Youth](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/safe-supportive-environments/PD-LGBTQ.htm)


> Creating Safe Schools for LGBTQ+ Youth Core Competencies for Professional Development This brief provides key learning objectives that schools and school districts can incorporate in their PD offerings to help teachers and other school staff build core competencies for supporting LGBTQ+ youth in schools. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ+) youth are more likely than non-LGBTQ+ youth to experience violence at school and have lower levels of school connectedness. Professional development (PD) for teachers and other school staff on how to support LGBTQ+ youth is a best practice for improving safety and connectedness in schools for both LGBTQ+ youth and their cisgender, heterosexual peers. Learning Objectives Learning Objective 1: Describe the Basics Understanding how sexual orientation and gender identity are defined and how the two differ is the first step in building a safe and supportive environment for LGBTQ+ youth. By knowing and applying these concepts, teachers and other school staff can help LGBTQ+ youth feel more welcomed at school. Sexual Orientation Sexual Orientation Define sexual orientation - Describe the diversity of sexual orientation among adolescents and young adults - Describe how sexual orientation is formed and evolves during adolescence - Define sexual orientation - Describe the diversity of sexual orientation among adolescents and young adults - Describe how sexual orientation is formed and evolves during adolescence - Gender Identity Gender Identity Define gender identity - Describe the diversity of gender identity among adolescents and young adults - Describe how gender identity is formed and evolves during adolescence - Define gender identity - Describe the diversity of gender identity among adolescents and young adults - Describe how gender identity is formed and evolves during adolescence - Inclusive Language Inclusive Language Describe the differences between sexual orientation and gender identity - Identify appropriate language, including affirming pronouns, when talking to or about LGBTQ+ youth - Describe the differences between sexual orientation and gender identity - Identify appropriate language, including affirming pronouns, when talking to or about LGBTQ+ youth - Learning Objective 2: Identify Health Disparities & Their Root Causes LGBTQ+ youth experience stigma and discrimination that put them at increased risk for negative health outcomes, such as poor mental health and high-risk substance use. Understanding what places LGBTQ+ youth at higher risk for negative health outcomes can provide teachers and other school staff with an important foundation for working to mitigate these health disparities. Discrimination & Stress Discrimination & Stress Describe how stigma, discrimination, harassment, and microaggressions affect LGBTQ+ youth - Describe how these negative experiences influence the psychological and physical stress levels of LGBTQ+ youth - Describe how stigma, discrimination, harassment, and microaggressions affect LGBTQ+ youth - Describe how these negative experiences influence the psychological and physical stress levels of LGBTQ+ youth - Health Risks & Disparities Health Risks & Disparities Define sexual health, mental health, substance use, and violence - Describe how LGBTQ+ youth disproportionately experience negative outcomes - Identify the role of discrimination and stress in shaping negative health outcomes for LGBTQ+ youth - Define sexual health, mental health, substance use, and violence - Describe how LGBTQ+ youth disproportionately experience negative outcomes - Identify the role of discrimination and stress in shaping negative health outcomes for LGBTQ+ youth - Learning Objective 3: Recognize the Influence of School Environments Being in a healthy, supportive school environment can help LGBTQ+ students thrive and help lessen some of the health disparities they face. Teachers and other school staff can build knowledge and awareness around what factors within schools have the potential to cause harm and what factors could help prevent some of these health risks. Risk Factors in Schools Risk Factors in Schools Define risk factors - Identify risk factors which primarily occur in school environments - Describe how school-based risk factors impact LGBTQ+ youth - Define risk factors - Identify risk factors which primarily occur in school environments - Describe how school-based risk factors impact LGBTQ+ youth - Protective Factors in Schools Protective Factors in Schools Define protective factors - Identify protective factors which primarily occur in school environments - Describe how school-based protective factors impact LGBTQ+ youth - Define protective factors - Identify protective factors which primarily occur in school environments - Describe how school-based protective factors impact LGBTQ+ youth - Learning Objective 4: Implement Supportive Policies & Practices Teachers and school staff can promote positive changes within school environments that address health disparities and help LGBTQ+ youth thrive in schools.

### [Creating Safe Spaces and Empowering Students](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/stories/aps_nm.htm)


> Creating Safe Spaces and Empowering Students Albuquerque Public Schools, New Mexico Through a virtual districtwide Genders and Sexualities Alliance (GSA), Albuquerque Public Schools is promoting safer and more supportive environments for LGBTQ+ youth by empowering students to create positive change. Albuquerque Public Schools formed a virtual GSA to continue meeting despite widespread school building closures due to COVID-19 pandemic-related disruptions. Through this virtual format, students and GSA advisors from across the district collaborated on “The Pronouns Project,” empowering students to advocate for being addressed by a name and pronoun corresponding to their gender identity in the virtual classroom setting. Students decided to focus on this change because many were being misidentified in classrooms, making them feel uncomfortable and unsafe. Students first met with community leaders and school board members to gain guidance and support for their work before getting the change approved by Albuquerque Public Schools’ leadership. As a result of this work, students throughout the district can update their name in the student information system, which automatically updates teachers’ rosters and their virtual classrooms. Albuquerque Public Schools has provided a safe and empowering space for students to lead positive change in their district. “The Pronouns Project” has already created more inclusive, safe, and supportive school environments for LGBTQ+ youth and will continue their work to make the district a place where their LGBTQ+ peers are validated, protected, and can thrive. “The Pronouns Project” did not stop there. The group wrote a resolution to make Albuquerque Public Schools more supportive for LGBTQ+ students. They presented their resolution with hundreds of signatures from students, staff, and other community members to the Board of Education. The Albuquerque Public Schools’ Board then approved their resolution, which includes mandatory Safe Zone training of all staff in the district and the creation of an advisory council of LGBTQ+ students to speak with the board and other district officials on issues facing LGBTQ+ youth. Quotes from student GSA members: “Pronoun use shows all people that they deserve to be happy with their identity.” “We believe that it is essential to normalize using pronouns and sharing current names in order to create a more affirming place for LGBTQ+ students, especially transgender students.” “Granting students access to changing their name to their current name and adding pronouns to their displayed name is an essential first step to normalizing pronoun use and including transgender students in the online environment, building positive relationships between students of the LGBTQ+ community and their peers and teachers, and promoting the academic and social success of all APS students.”
### [Diabetes and the LGBTQ Community](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/risk-factors/diabetes-risk-lgbtq.html)


> Key points - Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ) people have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. - 10% of the general population has diabetes, but 25% of gay or bisexual men and 14% of lesbian or bisexual women have it. Find out why. Overweight and obesity Having overweight or obesity can put you at risk for type 2 diabetes. In fact, nearly 90% of US adults with diabetes have overweight or obesity. Some research shows that LGBTQ people may have a higher risk for overweight or obesity. For example: - Lesbian and bisexual women are more likely to have overweight or obesity. - Transgender men are also more likely to have overweight or obesity. Overweight and obesity have been linked to long-term stress. The increased levels of stress the LGBTQ community faces may have negative health effects. Some research also shows that LGBTQ people may also have less healthy sleep patterns. Inconsistent sleep is another risk factor contributing to weight gain, long-term stress, and type 2 diabetes. While we can't control outside stressors, making certain lifestyle changes can help you lose weight (if recommended), manage stress, and improve sleep. Small changes can have big results over time. Talk to your doctor to find out what a healthy weight is for you and the best way to get there. Other health conditions Certain health conditions can increase your diabetes risk or make it harder to manage if you already have it. Although research is limited, there is evidence that LGBTQ adults have higher rates of chronic health conditions. For example: - Gay and bisexual men are more likely to have two or more chronic health conditions like high blood pressure, heart disease, and kidney disease. - Gay men, bisexual men, and transgender women have higher rates of HIV. Because some HIV medicines can increase insulin resistance, it's important to have your blood sugar tested to know your diabetes risk. - Lesbian and bisexual women are more likely to have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which increases the risk of type 2 diabetes. Behaviors that can increase risk Smoking Smoking causes a number of serious health conditions, including diabetes. If you smoke, you're 30% to 40% more likely to get type 2 diabetes than people who don't smoke. Research shows that: - Lesbian, gay, or bisexual adults have higher rates of cigarette smoking and use of other commercial tobacco products than non-LGBTQ adults. - Transgender adults are more likely to use commercial tobacco products than adults who are not transgender (cisgender). Many factors can explain why LGBTQ people experience higher rates of smoking. The tobacco industry aggressively markets their products to the LGBTQ community. Quitting smoking is one of the most important steps you can take to improve your health and your risk of type 2 diabetes. Remember you don't have to do it alone. Talk to a doctor about ways to quit. Gender-affirming hormones While research is limited, some studies show that gender-affirming hormones can cause weight gain, high blood pressure, insulin resistance, and higher cholesterol in transgender people. All are risk factors for type 2 diabetes. If you already have diabetes, these conditions can make it harder to manage. Talk to your doctor about any concerns or questions you have about hormone therapy and how it can affect your risk of type 2 diabetes, or diabetes management. Mental health Did you know that experiencing mental distress can also increase your risk for developing type 2 diabetes? And if you have diabetes, experiencing mental distress could make it harder to stick to your diabetes care plan. Members of the LGBTQ community have worse health outcomes for certain conditions, including mental health, compared to non-LGBTQ people. Feelings of rejection, shame, and low self-esteem that many LGBTQ people experience can affect mental and physical health. If you're experiencing mental distress, you're not alone. Don't wait to talk to a mental health professional. They can help manage your symptoms through medicine, talk therapy, or stress-relieving activities.
### [Gay-Straight/Genders Sexualities Alliances](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/safe-supportive-environments/sexuality-alliances.htm)


> Gay-Straight/Genders & Sexualities Alliances Gay-Straight Alliances or Genders and Sexualities Alliances have been associated with improvements in school safety, a key component of school connectedness, for all students. Research specifically links the presence of Gay-Straight Alliances or Genders and Sexualities Alliances (GSAs) to greater feelings of school connectedness among Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning (LGBTQ) students. GSAs are also linked to positive youth development and increasing young people’s sense of purpose, self-esteem, and agency. They have also been linked to reduced risk across health outcomes related to HIV and other STDs, including experiencing violence, illicit drug use and prescription drug misuse, and suicidal ideation. Prevention benefits have been documented for heterosexual youth in addition to LGBTQ youth. Schools and local education agencies can create and implement a plan for establishing GSAs in schools that do not already have them and strengthening GSAs in schools that do. Resources GSAN.

### [Health Considerations for LGBTQ Youth](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/disparities/health-considerations-lgbtq-youth.htm)


> Health Considerations for LGBTQ Youth Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ) youth are part of every community, come from all walks of life, and are present in every racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographical group. While many LGBTQ youth transition from childhood to adulthood successfully and become healthy and productive adults, others are negatively impacted as a result of many factors; for LGBTQ youth, social stigma about their sexual choices or identities can be particularly difficult. Stigma comes in many forms, such as discrimination, harassment, family disapproval, social rejection, and violence. This puts LGBTQ youth at increased risk for certain negative health outcomes. For example, young gay and bisexual males have disproportionately high rates of HIV, syphilis, and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs); adolescent lesbian and bisexual females are more likely to have ever been pregnant than their heterosexual peers; and transgender youth are more likely to have attempted suicide than their cisgender peers.1-3 There are many terms used to describe LGBTQ sexual and gender identity. On this site DASH uses LGBTQ to refer to the broad population of youth who identify with a sexual or gender identity other than cisgender or heterosexual. When specific studies or surveillance data are discussed, a narrower acronym may be used to be consistent with the populations in data being discussed. View the TermsYRBS Transgender Report In 2017, ten states (Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin) and nine large urban school districts (Boston, Cleveland, District of Columbia, Detroit, Broward County, Los Angeles, New York City, San Diego, San Francisco) piloted a question to measure the proportion of high school students who identify as transgender. Survey data from population-based samples of selected state and urban school districts (n=19 sites) indicate that an average of 1.8% of high school students identify as transgender. Transgender students are more likely than cisgender students to report violence victimization, substance use, and suicide risk, and although generally more likely to report sexual risk behaviors, were also more likely to report being tested for HIV.

> Health Disparities Among LGBTQ Youth There are many terms used to describe LGBTQ sexual and gender identity. On this site DASH uses LGBTQ to refer to the broad population of youth who identify with a sexual or gender identity other than cisgender or heterosexual. When specific studies or surveillance data are discussed, a narrower acronym may be used to be consistent with the populations in data being discussed. View the TermsSexual minority youth (SMY) refers to youth who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB), who are not sure of their sexual identity, or who have any same sex partners. CDC’s 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey data show substantial health disparities that exist among an estimated 2.6 million sexual minority students, placing them at risk for negative health outcomes, including HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Students who have sexual contact with both sexes are at higher risk than students with only same-sex sexual contact for multiple sexual risk behaviors. Many LGBTQ youth thrive during adolescence, but, stigma, discrimination, and other factors put them at increased risk for negative health and life outcomes. CDC works with education and public health partners to address health risks and disparities among LGBTQ youth. Together, we can improve the health and lives of sexual minority youth so they achieve their social, emotional, and academic potential. Compared to their heterosexual peers, sexual minority students are more likely to have: Been bullied at school 33% LGB students - 24% unsure - 16% heterosexual - 36% have same sex - 19% only opposite sex - Felt sad or hopeless 63% LGB students - 46% unsure - 28% heterosexual - 64% have same sex - 35% only opposite sex - Been forced to have sex 22% LGB students - 13% unsure - 5% heterosexual - 30% have same sex - 10% only opposite sex - Seriously considered suicide 48% LGB students - 32% unsure - 13% heterosexual - 45% have same sex - 19% only opposite sex - Used illicit drugs 23% LGB students - 27% unsure - 12% heterosexual - 36% have same sex - 19% only opposite sex - Misused prescription opioids 24% LGB students - 18% unsure - 13% heterosexual - 35% have same sex - 20% only opposite sex - YRBS Transgender Report In 2017, ten states (Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin) and nine large urban school districts (Boston, Cleveland, District of Columbia, Detroit, Broward County, Los Angeles, New York City, San Diego, San Francisco) piloted a question to measure the proportion of high school students who identify as transgender.

### [Improving the LGBTQ+ Mental Health Experience](https://www.cdc.gov/prc/research-in-action/success-stories/UMD-PRC-improving-the-lgbtq-mental-health-experience.html)


> Improving the LGBTQ+ Mental Health Experience: The University of Maryland Prevention Research Center’s Approach People in the LGBTQ+ community face unique challenges when seeking health care. Many people in the LGBTQ+ community experience high levels of chronic stress related to stigma and discrimination, which increases their risk for depression, anxiety, suicide, substance use, and other mental health struggles. In addition, LGBTQ+ people experience challenges when seeking health care services due to lack of clinician understanding, acceptance, and sensitivity. The University of Maryland Prevention Research Center (UMD-PRC) is taking a multi-level (i.e., organization and therapist) and multi-strategy (i.e., workshop, technical assistance, and clinical consultation) approach to help people in the LGBTQ+ community receive the tailored and affirmative mental health care services they deserve. In the past year, 10 behavioral health organizations received virtual LGBTQ+ cultural competence training through the Sexual and Gender Diversity Learning Community (SGDLC), which includes a two-day (7 hour) training session with administrators and therapists, four 2-hour technical assistance (TA) sessions with administrators, and six 1-hour clinical consultation sessions with therapists. As an improvement to similar trainings, the SGDLC was designed to address both organizational and therapist-level change. Importantly, the SGDLC was designed with LGBTQ-focused and LGBTQ-identifying mental health providers, researchers, and community members. UMD-PRC offered innovative technical assistance to behavioral health organizations. At the organizational level, administrators attended the two-day training session and joined four 2-hour virtual technical assistance sessions for four months, which included developing a plan to improve their organization’s practices. During the sessions, administrators learned about the intersectional nature of stigmatized identities, the unique needs of LGBTQ+ people seeking care, and how to integrate affirming organizational practices into their work, such as more inclusive intake data forms, scheduling and reception, educational materials, signage, and employee hiring and training. Administrators shared that the TA sessions were “an invaluable experience.” UMD-PRC conducted focus groups with administrators that attended the TA sessions and received overwhelmingly positive feedback. Participants shared that: They now understand that affirming care means acknowledging and supporting diverse sexual and gender identities in their practice. - They recognize that the culture and procedures of their practice can contribute positively or negatively to the lived experiences of their clients and are using organizational assessments to create more welcoming and inclusive environments. - They are making changes in their practices by updating intake forms, changing how legal and adopted names are used in data systems, creating advocacy committees, and offering LGBTQ+ sensitivity training to all employees. - UMD-PRC is taking SGDLC statewide. During the focus groups, many administrators requested additional resources to continue their education and showed interest in expanding the training to other parts of Maryland. UMD-PRC plans to offer the full SGDLC training program to behavioral health organizations across Maryland to continue to improve the LGBTQ+ mental health care experience. The University of Maryland Prevention Research Center is one of 26 Prevention Research Centers (PRCs) supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the 2019–2024 funding cycle.
### [Inclusive Practices Help All Students Thrive](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/safe-supportive-environments/LGBTQ-policies-practices.htm)


> Inclusive Practices Help All Students Thrive Adolescents are experiencing a mental health crisis. Youth were struggling with their mental health before the COVID-19 pandemic. This is especially true for youth who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or questioning (LGBTQ). Recent CDC data show that adolescents are experiencing widespread emotional distress, worsened by stressors experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic affected all students, but it did not affect all students equally. While poor mental health is common in youth, it is reported far more often by LGBTQ youth. Schools can help address the adolescent mental health crisis by implementing policies and practices that support LGBTQ youth. CDC research shows that inclusive practices benefit LGBTQ students and heterosexual students, with heterosexual students seeing greater benefit in some risk categories. The reverse is also true. Restrictive LGBTQ policies and practices negatively impact heterosexual students as well. Less emotional distress - Less violence and harassment - Less suicidal thoughts and behaviors - The more policies and practices a school implements the better the student health outcomes. LGBTQ-supportive policies and practices positively affect a school’s environment, making a safer and more supportive space for ALL students. They include: Gender and Sexuality Alliances Professional development on inclusivity Identifying safe spaces Implementing anti-harassment policies CDC’s School Practices that Work CDC’s What Works In Schools program combines safe and supportive school environments with quality health education and referrals to health services to create a three-strategy, school-based approach to protecting and promoting adolescent health. Schools that implement What Works In Schools see positive outcomes on the number of students experiencing violence, drug use, risky sex behaviors, and poor mental health.

### [LGBTQ+ People Encounter Barriers to Quitting Successfully](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco-health-equity/collection/lgbtq-quitting-tobacco.html)


> At a glance - Most people who smoke want to quit, and more than half of them try to do so each year. - Connecting every person who wants to quit with treatment proven to help them quit for good is important for improving people's health. - Descriptions of strategies that states and communities can use to help people quit smoking are below. Barriers to quitting Most people who smoke want to quit, and more than half try to do so each year.1 Proven treatments make it more likely that people will quit smoking successfully. These treatments include behavioral counseling and medicines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). LGBTQ+ people who smoke often run into barriers when trying to find and use these treatments.A For example: - In a national study in 2009-2010, a lower percentage of gay, bisexual, and transgender men (66.7%) were aware of tobacco quitlines than their non-GBT counterparts (83.9%), although quitline use was similar.2 - In a study of smoking adults in one state, lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults who were aware of their state quitline were less likely to report an intention to call the quitline than their heterosexual counterparts.3 - In 2015, fewer gay, lesbian, and bisexual adults who smoked reported using counseling and/or FDA-approved medicines to help them quit than straight adults who smoked (14.5% vs 31.7%).4 - LGBTQ+ people often fear or experience discrimination or disrespect from medical professionals.5 People who are afraid of discrimination from doctors and other health workers are less likely to seek medical care, including preventive screenings. The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey found that nearly 1 in 4 transgender people (23%) reported avoiding looking for health care they needed in the past year because they were afraid of discrimination or mistreatment on the basis of gender identity.5 - LGBTQ+ people may rank tobacco use as a lower health priority than other issues that affect the LGBTQ+ community (such as HIV/AIDS, hate crimes, suicide).6 Connecting people to resources is critical for health equity What states and communities can do Provide barrier-free, widely promoted coverage for all evidence-based cessation treatments by all types of health insurance As of 2018, only 15 state Medicaid programs fully covered tobacco cessation (quitting) services for all enrollees of traditional Medicaid.7 Increase access to culturally tailored cessation services When it comes to health issues, one size does not fit all. Different people and communities have different needs and make decisions in different ways. For example, some LGBTQ+ people may think of smoking as a way of rebelling against traditional gender roles.8 Tailored cessation resources and improved access to these resources could be helpful. For example, these resources could address some experiences and stressors associated with smoking that may be unique to LGBTQ+ people.9 Share health messages that feature LGBTQ+ people and their experiences Mass media campaigns are proven to increase smoking cessation, prevent tobacco use initiation, and reduce the prevalence of tobacco use.1011 However, anti-smoking messages rarely appear in media designed for LGBTQ+ people. Anti-commercial tobacco messaging and mass media campaigns can feature testimonials from LGBTQ+ people.B9 CDC's Tips From Former Smokers® (Tips®) is one example of a campaign that has done this.

> At a glance - Everyone deserves a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible. This is called health equity. - Achieving health equity means addressing systemwide problems, unfair practices, and unjust conditions that have a negative impact on the health of specific groups. Overview In order to achieve health equity, we work to eliminate health disparities. Health disparities are differences in health outcomes that are closely linked with social, economic, and environmental factors, among LGBTQ+ people.A To improve health equity, we must consider the role of commercial tobacco.B Continue reading LGBTQ+ People Experience a Health Burden From Commercial Tobacco Unfair and Unjust Practices Harm LGBTQ+ People and Drive Health Disparities LGBTQ+ People Encounter Barriers to Quitting Successfully - The term "LGBTQ+" is used on this page to refer to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, with the plus sign indicating inclusion of people who are queer, questioning, intersex, asexual, or who hold other gender/sex/romantic identities not specifically identified. Many studies cited on this page only looked at certain groups within the greater LGBTQ+ community. When single terms like "gay" or "lesbian," or acronyms like "LGB" are used on this page, this corresponds with how terms are used in the cited studies. More studies are needed to understand the ways that commercial tobacco and exposure affects other groups in the LGBTQ+ community. - "Commercial tobacco" means harmful products that are made and sold by tobacco companies. It does not include "traditional tobacco" used by indigenous groups for religious or ceremonial purposes.
### [La diabetes y la comunidad LGBTQ](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/es/risk-factors/la-diabetes-y-la-comunidad-lgbtq.html)


> Puntos clave Las personas lesbianas, gais, bisexuales, transgénero o queer (LGBTQ) tienen un mayor riesgo de presentar diabetes tipo 2. - El 10 % de la población general tiene diabetes, pero el 25 % de los hombres gais o bisexuales y el 14 % de las mujeres lesbianas o bisexuales tienen diabetes. Averigüe por qué. - Sobrepeso y obesidad Tener sobrepeso u obesidad puede ponerlo en riesgo de presentar diabetes tipo 2. De hecho, casi el 90 % de los adultos con diabetes en los Estados Unidos tienen sobrepeso u obesidad. Algunas investigaciones muestran que las personas LGBTQ podrían tener un mayor riesgo de sobrepeso u obesidad. Por ejemplo: Las mujeres lesbianas y bisexuales tienen más probabilidades de presentar sobrepeso u obesidad. - Los hombres transgénero también tienen más probabilidades de presentar sobrepeso u obesidad. - El sobrepeso y la obesidad han sido vinculados al estrés a largo plazo. Los niveles más elevados de estrés que enfrenta la comunidad LGBTQ podrían tener efectos negativos para la salud. Además, algunas investigaciones muestran que las personas LGBTQ también podrían tener patrones de sueño menos saludables. El sueño irregular es otro factor de riesgo que contribuye al aumento de peso, el estrés a largo plazo y la diabetes tipo 2. Si bien no podemos controlar los factores de estrés exteriores, hacer ciertos cambios de estilo de vida puede ayudarlo a bajar de peso (si se recomienda), manejar el estrés y mejorar el sueño. Los cambios pequeños pueden tener grandes resultados con el tiempo. Hable con su médico para saber cuál es un peso saludable para usted y la mejor forma de alcanzarlo. Otras condiciones médicas Ciertas condiciones médicas pueden aumentar su riesgo de presentar diabetes o hacer que sea más difícil manejarla si ya la tiene. Aunque la investigación es limitada, hay evidencia de que los adultos LGBTQ tienen tasas más altas de condiciones médicas crónicas. Por ejemplo: Los hombres gais y bisexuales tienen más probabilidades de presentar dos o más condiciones médicas crónicas como presión arterial alta, enfermedades del corazón y enfermedad de los riñones. - Los hombres gais, los hombres bisexuales y las mujeres transgénero tienen tasas más altas del VIH. Debido a que algunos medicamentos para el VIH pueden aumentar la resistencia a la insulina, es importante que se haga la prueba del nivel de azúcar en la sangre para saber cuál es su riesgo de diabetes. - Las mujeres lesbianas y bisexuales tienen más probabilidades de presentar el síndrome del ovario poliquístico (PCOS, por sus siglas en inglés), lo que aumenta el riesgo de diabetes tipo 2. - Comportamientos que pueden aumentar el riesgo Fumar Fumar causa varias enfermedades graves, incluida la diabetes. Si fuma, sus probabilidades de presentar diabetes tipo 2 son entre un 30 y un 40 % mayores que las de las personas que no fuman. Las investigaciones muestran lo siguiente: Las personas lesbianas, gais o bisexuales adultas tienen tasas más altas de consumo de cigarrillos y de otros productos de tabaco comerciales que las personas adultas que no son LGBTQ. - Los adultos transgénero tienen más probabilidades de consumir productos de tabaco comerciales que los adultos que no son transgénero (cisgénero). - Muchos factores pueden explicar por qué las personas LGBTQ tienen tasas más altas de consumo de cigarrillos. La industria tabacalera promociona intensamente sus productos a la comunidad LGBTQ. Dejar de fumar es una de las medidas más importantes que puede tomar para mejorar su salud y disminuir el riesgo de presentar diabetes tipo 2. Recuerde que no tiene por qué hacerlo solo. Hable con un médico sobre las maneras de dejar de fumar. Hormonas de afirmación de género Si bien la investigación es limitada, algunos estudios muestran que las hormonas de afirmación de género pueden causar aumento de peso, presión arterial alta, resistencia a la insulina y niveles más altos de colesterol en las personas transgénero. Todos son factores de riesgo para la diabetes tipo 2. Si ya tiene diabetes, estos factores pueden hacer que sea más difícil de manejar. Hable con su médico sobre cualquier duda o inquietud que tenga sobre la terapia hormonal, y cómo puede afectar su riesgo de presentar diabetes tipo 2 o el manejo de la diabetes. Salud mental ¿Sabía que el distrés mental también puede aumentar el riesgo de presentar diabetes tipo 2? Y si tiene diabetes, el distrés mental podría hacer que le sea más difícil apegarse a su plan de cuidado de la diabetes. Los miembros de la comunidad LGBTQ tienen peores efectos en la salud para ciertas enfermedades, incluida la salud mental, en comparación con las personas que no son LGBTQ. Los sentimientos de rechazo, vergüenza y baja autoestima que tienen muchas personas LGBTQ pueden afectar su salud mental y física. Si usted tiene distrés mental, no está solo. No espere para hablar con un profesional de salud mental, quien puede ayudarlo a manejar sus síntomas a través de medicamentos, terapia hablada o actividades que alivien el estrés.

### [PRCs Focus on Mental Health in Their Communities](https://www.cdc.gov/prc/research-in-action/issue-briefs/prc-focus-on-mental-health.html)


> Prevention Research Centers Focus on Mental Health in Their Communities Mental health and the management of mental health crises play an essential role in the overall health of individuals and their communities. Prevention Research Centers (PRCs) study how people and their communities can avoid or minimize the risk for chronic illnesses and improve health, including mental health. PRCs engage with their communities to develop and carry out evidence-based programs to increase the awareness of mental health as a public health issue and to benefit the communities they serve. - 163 million people live in a designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Area. 1 - 1 in 5 U.S. adults experience mental illness each year. 2 - 1 in 8 women experience symptoms of postpartum depression. 3 - More than 50% of LGBTQ and transgender adults are currently battling poor mental health. 4 Community-Focused Mental Health Research The PRCs have centered some of their work around improving mental health equity, examining mental health and health care issues, and improving skill and competency through training in the 2019–2024 funding cycle. In May 2020, the PRC Network also formed a Mental Health Workgroup to encourage coordination and collaboration across PRCs working on improving mental health resources, as well as identifying and establishing best practices in their communities. The workgroup leveraged intervention models and shared resources, such as existing intervention models that were successful in other countries and established a shared database for outcome data. Workgroup members also developed health promotion educational resources, mental health toolkits, and educational programs. These tools and resources better equip communities to identify and effectively assist a person experiencing a mental health crisis. Read more about the PRCs’ work to improve mental health in their communities below. Morehouse School of Medicine’s PRC developed a “Mental Health First Aid” course that addresses disparities in access and use of mental health services in communities of color. The goal is to ensure that community members can identify, understand, and respond to signs of mental illness and substance use disorders so they can help their fellow community members during a crisis. The course teaches common signs of mental health crises and discusses how to connect a person in crisis to resources. Upon completion, participants receive a certificate in mental health education that is valid for 3 years. The University of Maryland’s “Simulated Patient Assessment and Feedback for Mental Health Provider LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual) Cultural Sensitivity” study highlights the need for an assessment of LGBTQ+ cultural competency skills of mental health clinicians who receive Sexual and Gender Diversity Learning Community (SGDLC) training versus those who do not. The outcome of the assessment will help to develop an evaluation tool for assessing LGBTQ+ cultural competencies among mental health professionals. The University of Wisconsin PRC’s Addressing Postpartum Depression in Wisconsin Home Visiting Programs uses a novel two-generational, parent-infant relationship focused, community-based approach to reduce the risks associated with maternal depression. The PRC, along with national and international experts and partners, is researching an existing Mother-Infant Therapy Group program to better reach and address the needs of women experiencing depression in the postpartum period, their infants, and families. Their goal is to adapt the existing program for widespread dissemination, adoption, and implementation in Wisconsin, as well as nationally. The University of Washington PRC’s evidence-based Program to Encourage Active, Rewarding Lives (PEARLS) Equity, expands access to depression care for older adults in disproportionately affected communities by partnering with organizations that are already serving these communities to ensure PEARLS is adapted to meet the individual needs of each community. PEARLS is adaptable to various community needs and helps expand access to depression care in underserved communities, including rural ones. The program is for older adults, especially those who have limited access to depression care because of systemic racism, trauma, language barriers, low income, or place of residence. PEARLS Equity is a powerful tool for making depression care accessible to under-resourced communities, because organizations can tailor it to individual community needs. Individual communities celebrate their elders in different ways; PEARLS is designed to build on those strengths. The Future of PRCs and Mental Health Addressing the mental health needs of communities is and will continue to be a priority focus area for the PRC Program. The PRCs will continue to focus on research that is tailored to the communities they serve. The outcomes and interventions PRCs produce help them develop tools that can be used to improve overall community and public health.

### [Pride in Being Tobacco-Free](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/tobacco-features/pride-month.html)


> At a glance This Pride Month, consider taking the step to quit smoking and living a smokefree life. Pride Month Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) Pride Month is a time to recognize, celebrate, and commemorate LGBTQ+ people. Pride Month is also a time to focus on improving the health of LGBTQ+ people—like staying tobacco-free. Use of cigarettes and other commercial tobacco products is higher among some population groups and communities, including lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people, compared to heterosexual/straight people. There are many reasons for this, including stress related to prejudice, stigma, and aggressive marketing by tobacco companies that sponsor events, promotions, giveaways, and advertisements targeting LGBTQ+ communities. Though some people may smoke or vape to try to cope with stress, nicotine addiction from using these products can actually be a source of stress. Quitting commercial tobacco product use, like smoking, can improve physical health. This includes improving cardiovascular health and reducing the risk of cancer, among many other health benefits. Quitting can also lower levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. It can improve mood and quality of life. Staying Tobacco-free Angie P.'s Story Angie P. is a member of the LGBTQ+ community and started smoking as a teenager. She started smoking menthol cigarettes at age 15 because she wanted to mimic her mother's smoking. Angie never felt like she belonged in her family or her community. She knew she liked girls but thought being gay would be difficult for her family to accept. In high school, she started hanging out with friends who smoked cigarettes and drank alcohol. Angie realized that she would smoke every time she felt hurt or angry. She smoked up to two packs a day as a teenager. As an adult, Angie moved to Las Vegas to launch a professional singing career. She struggled with substance use and lived on the street for two years. Angie reached out for professional help and was able to end her alcohol and substance use. But the one addiction she continued to struggle with was smoking. At age 41, Angie overheard a group of people talking about a program that used an FDA-approved quit-smoking medicine. Angie immediately signed up for the program. Within a week of joining, Angie quit smoking for good. Today, Angie shares her story to help others struggling with substance use and tobacco addiction. Angie is also aware of the tobacco industry's aggressive advertising of cigarettes, especially menthol cigarettes, particularly to reach LGBTQ+ communities and communities of color. As someone who is gay and African American, Angie feels the tobacco companies took advantage of her to profit from a harmful product. "My hope is to help other people, especially LGBTQ+ people, understand what the tobacco companies are trying to do with their advertising. I'd tell them it's not worth it to smoke," Angie said. "Their lives and their health are worth more." Quitting Resources Health equity and health disparities among LGBTQ+ people Many LBGTQ+ people have experienced harassment, discrimination, and forms of violence related to unfair and unjust practices, policies, and conditions. This is true for other minority groups as well. Experiences of discrimination and stressful social and environmental conditions are associated with commercial tobacco product and other substance use. Use of these products can contribute to poor health outcomes. LGBTQ+ people can also encounter barriers to successfully quitting tobacco use. For instance, some LGBTQ+ people fear or experience discrimination or disrespect from medical professionals. People who are afraid of discrimination from health professionals are less likely to seek medical care and they may be less likely to use proven treatment options. Fewer LGB adults who smoke report using treatment (medication or counseling) to help them quit smoking, compared to straight adults who smoke. Connecting every person who wants to quit smoking with treatment proven to help them successfully quit is important for improving people's health. How to quit smoking This Pride Month, consider taking the step to quit smoking and living a smokefree life. Quitting smoking is one of the most important actions you can take to improve your health. This is true regardless of your age or how long you have been smoking. Tools to help you quit smoking include: - Calling a quitline: They provide free coaching—over the phone—to help you quit smoking. When you call 1-800-QUIT-NOW, you can speak confidentially with a highly trained quit coach. Quitlines are available throughout the United States, and coaching help is available in several languages. Some quitlines offer text messaging support. - Texting The National Texting Portal: The portal connects you (adults 18 years of age and older in the United States) with mobile text message-based support to help you quit smoking. - Making a quit plan: Build My Quit Plan | Smokefree - Quit-smoking medicines: Learn About Quit Smoking Medicines For more help, see Tips For Quitting.
### [Program Success Stories](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/stories/)


> Success Stories CDC’s Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH) works to protect the nation’s youth from HIV, STDs, and pregnancy through programs, policies, and partnerships. DASH supports local, state, territorial and tribal nation education and health agencies as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to improve the health and well-being of our nation’s youth. School-based surveillance provides critical data about health risk behaviors and experiences facing youth. These data help inform effective school-based prevention programs that connect education and public health efforts to strategies that work: Deliver quality health education - Create systems to link students to health services - Establish safe and supportive school environments - Program Impact New evaluation studies on CDC’s What Works In Schools program show benefits to students. This primary prevention program supports school districts in implementing three strategies in middle and high schools—quality health education, access to health services, and safe and supportive school environments. Study findings indicated that students whose schools put the three strategies in place were less likely to report that students had ever had sex, - had four or more sexual partners, - were currently sexually active, - missed school because of feeling unsafe, - had been forced to have sex, and - had ever or were currently using marijuana. - These study findings shows that when schools implement CDC’s program, they can prevent some of the most significant risks to the health and well-being of students. Making the Grade: LGBTQ-Inclusive Schools LGBTQ-supportive policies and practices positively affect a school’s environment, making a safer and more supportive space for ALL students. Schools can help address adolescent health by implementing policies and practices that support LGBTQ students. Find out how schools were able to create inclusive environments. DASH Program Highlights CDC School Programs Empower Students for Success For 30 years, CDC has worked with education and public health agencies to promote and implement school health programs, policies, and practices that protect adolescent health. CDC’s long term investment in partnerships with education agencies has led to better school health policies and programs at the state and local levels. This story highlights DASH’s policy work over three decades.
### [Protective Factors for LGBTQ Youth](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/disparities/protective-factors-for-lgbtq-youth.htm)


> Protective Factors for LGBTQ Youth Information for Health and Education Professionals Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ) youth are more likely to experience poor health than their heterosexual (straight) or cisgender peers.1-4 Supporting the health of LGBTQ youth has usually involved trying to understand and reduce factors that increase their risk. Much less attention has been paid to protective factors—the characteristics, conditions, and behaviors that directly improve positive health outcomes or reduce the effects of stressful life events and other risk factors. Funding from the Arcus Foundation to the CDC Foundation supported the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH) to review the published literature on protective factors for LGBTQ youth to identify gaps and opportunities for research and intervention. DASH focused on factors that promote sexual health for LGBTQ (i.e., sexual minority) youth. For transgender youth, we considered a broader set of factors that promote mental health and academic success in addition to sexual health. This page summarizes key findings that can strengthen programs and research that support LGBTQ youth. What research has been done? Very little research was found on sexual health-related protective factors for LGBTQ youth age 15-24 years. A search for articles about individual-level factors (things like knowledge, attitudes and skills) that promote positive sexual health outcomes for LGBTQ youth identified 20 articles reporting on 12 studies.5 A second search for articles about relationship-level protective factors (things like how people communicate with partners and parents) for the sexual health of LGBTQ youth identified 42 articles reporting on 32 studies.6 Most of this research on LGBTQ youth looks at young gay and bisexual men and does not include young lesbian, bisexual, and other women who have sex with women.5,6 Only 21 articles, reporting on the results of 19 studies, addressed protective factors that support sexual and mental health and positive education outcomes for transgender and other gender diverse youth.7 The published articles looked at a variety of different factors; however, many of these factors only appeared in one or two studies. Some factors that have been found to be protective for heterosexual youth were not studied at all. While most studies of individual-level factors focused on beliefs and attitudes; only a few considered skills and competencies. Opportunities for Researchers To guide programs, we need more research on protective factors for LGBTQ youth. Based on the gaps identified in the DASH reviews, the following is needed: More research on protective factors for young lesbian, bisexual, and other women who have sex with women - Examination of differences between young bisexual men and women and their gay and lesbian peers - Designed and implemented longitudinal studies - Consistent measurement of potential protective factors affecting LGBTQ youth health - Examination of LGBTQ youth’s skills and competencies related to sexual health promotion - Examination of LGBTQ youth’s relationships with medical providers and other trusted adults - What factors are protective? Given the limits of existing research, it is hard to say what factors promote sexual health and positive outcomes among LGBTQ youth. However, some factors had protective effects in multiple studies. For gay and bisexual young men, these include: Positive attitudes about condoms, such as thinking that condoms are pleasurable or important for healthy relationships. - Increased peer group acceptance of safer sex, meaning that friends support condom use and other behaviors that reduce risk. - For transgender youth, these include: Acceptance and support from parents and peers, particularly when it comes to sexual orientation and gender identity. - Gay-straight alliances, which are student-led clubs that provide a safe place for students to support each other around issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity. - What can health and education professionals do? Health and education professionals engaged in practice or research should pay more attention to protective factors for LGBTQ youth. In addition to reducing risk, developing the assets of LGBTQ youth gives them resources to successfully navigate challenges. The articles included in the reviews and the broader literature suggest promising practices for doing so. Health and education professionals working to support programs in community and school settings can promote: Positive youth development. Positive youth development (PYD) involves strengthening protective factors, including skills, competencies and supportive relationships. PYD programs have improved sexual health8 and should be open and welcoming to LGBTQ youth. Resources on PYD are available via youth.gov. - Inclusive sexual health education. Sex education that is relevant to LGBTQ youth can increase their ability to use condoms and talk with their partner about safer sex.9 - Gay-straight alliances. Gay-straight alliances (GSAs) have been found to help LGBTQ youth as well as heterosexual, cisgender youth.10,11 The Genders Sexualities Alliance Network has developed tools for creating and supporting GSAs. - Parent engagement. Family acceptance has been linked to positive health outcomes for sexual and gender minority youth.12,13 The Family Acceptance Project offers resources to strengthen family support of LGBTQ youth. - Johns, M.

> At a glance The tobacco industry targets the LGBTQ+ community with marketing and advertising. - Stress can increase commercial tobacco use and can make health problems worse. - Overview Sexual and gender minority groups have experienced harassment, discrimination, and been exposed to forms of violence related to unfair and unjust practices, policies, and conditions.1 Experiences of discrimination and stressful socioenvironmental conditions are associated with commercial tobacco product and other substance use and, in turn, can contribute to poor health outcomes.A2 Some examples of historical policies and practices in the United States (U.S.) that have led to mental and physical health risks and challenges, and related long-term outcomes, for LGBTQ+ people include:B Laws targeting LGBTQ+ people by making same-sex relationships illegal. These laws were in place from the time the nation was founded until 2003. In 1960, all fifty states had laws against same-sex sexual activity. Before the 2003 Supreme Court ruling in Lawrence v. Texas, sexual activity between people of the same sex was illegal in 14 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. military. Making same-sex relationships a crime led to unjust practices that harmed LGBTQ+ people, including discrimination in finding housing and jobs and children being removed from their parents' care.3 - Marriage bans prevented many LGBTQ+ people from having the same rights as straight married couples, such as job protection while caring for a sick spouse and the ability to add spouses to employer-sponsored health insurance plans.4 Until the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling (Obergefell vs. Hodges), states were not required to recognize marriages between same-sex couples and many states denied same-sex couples the right to marry. Marriage bans caused stigma and made same-sex couples less equal in the eyes of the law, adding to chronic stress.2 - Some LGBTQ+ people have experienced harm and distress caused by people expressing anti-LGBTQ+ views using hate crimes: threats, verbal abuse, vandalism, and violence. 56As of 2017, fewer than half of U.S. states offered legal protection from discrimination based on sexual orientation.7 - LGBTQ+ people have also experienced discrimination and harm from health care systems and medical science. For example: Organized medicine in the United States has often made stigma around same-sex attraction worse by using supposedly scientific reasons for this discrimination. For instance, the American Psychiatric Association’s official diagnostic book (the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual) stated that homosexuality was a mental disorder until 1973.8 - Between 1923 and 1981, the state of Oregon had people who committed “crimes against nature” (a way it described same-sex sexual activity) sterilized without their consent.9 - There are also current reasons—like the ones explored below—that help explain why commercial tobacco affects the health of LGBTQ+ people. The tobacco industry targets the LGBTQ+ community with marketing and advertising. Marketing plays a big role in whether people try or use commercial tobacco products. Being around commercial tobacco ads makes smoking appear more appealing and increases the chance that someone will try smoking for the first time or start using commercial tobacco products regularly.10111213 Tobacco companies spend billions of dollars each year to aggressively market their products. They also target specific populations, including the LGBTQ+ population, and flood them with commercial tobacco advertising.14 Donations and Sponsorships. In the early 1990s, tobacco companies were among the first large corporations to advertise in magazines and newspapers targeted at LGBTQ+ readers, sponsor Pride parades, and give donations to organizations serving LGBTQ+ people.11 Tobacco companies said in documents not shown to the public that these sponsorships and ads were marketing tactics designed to attract LGBTQ+ people to their products. In the 1990s, they gave one LGBT+ marketing strategy the code name “Project SCUM (Sub-Culture Urban Marketing).”14 Tobacco companies still advertise at festivals and other community events held by and for LGBTQ+ people and give to local and national groups serving LGBTQ+ people and people living with HIV. - Targeted advertising. Tobacco companies advertise heavily in publications with gay and lesbian readership, often using images that show LGBTQ+ people using tobacco as a “normal” part of life.15 - Nightlife Marketing: Bars and clubs have traditionally been one of the few spaces in which LGBTQ+ people have felt safe to meet and socialize openly.16 Tobacco companies work to promote their brands in these spaces and sponsor nightclub after-parties in bars and clubs.14 - Marketing flavored tobacco products to LGBTQ+ people using symbolism. Adding flavors (like menthol) to commercial tobacco products can mask the harshness of tobacco, promote youth initiation, lead to establishment of product use, and can contribute to lifelong tobacco use.71718 Ads for flavored tobacco products have used LGBTQ+ symbolism, including phrases like “Take pride in your flavor” or images of colored packages arranged like a rainbow.19 Tobacco companies have also heavily marketed menthol cigarettes to LGBTQ+ people. This can help to explain why about 36% of LGBTQ+ people who smoke use menthol cigarettes compared to 29% of straight people who smoke.15 - Public health strategies can help reduce the pressure to buy that comes with heavy advertising and discounts. To help protect LGBTQ+ people from tobacco price promotions and discourage tobacco product use, states and communities could consider increasing prices and prohibiting price discounts, prohibiting the sale of flavored tobacco products, and either allowing fewer stores in a neighborhood to sell commercial tobacco products or prohibiting tobacco product sales altogether.20 Another step that states and communities can take include making all workplaces smokefree—with no exceptions. Many workplaces are now covered by a smokefree law—but gaps in smokefree protections often leave out bars and nightclubs. In places that do not have comprehensive smokefree laws bartenders and servers in LGBT nightclubs can be harmed by exposure to secondhand smoke.21 Stress can increase commercial tobacco use, and can make health problems worse. When people face many forms of stress—like financial problems, discrimination, or unsafe neighborhoods—they can be more likely to smoke.222324 Most LGBTQ+ people say they have experienced some form of harassment or discrimination because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. More than half have had slurs used against them, and 57% report that they or a close friend have been threatened with violence.2526 The link between discrimination, stress, and commercial tobacco helps to explain why: Gay college students are more likely to smoke when they have to hide their orientation.27 - Transgender people who have faced discrimination in ways that do not respect their gender identity—such as having to use IDs with the wrong gender—are more likely to smoke than transgender people who are supported in their gender identity.28 - LGBTQ+ youth who attend schools with LGBT-friendly policies and student groups are less likely to begin smoking.29 - When people have severe or long-lasting stress, their bodies respond by raising stress hormones and keeping them raised. When this goes on for a long time, they may develop health problems like high blood pressure or a faster heart rate.3031 Smoking cigarettes also leads to disease and disability and harms nearly every organ in the body.10 "Commercial tobacco" means harmful products that are made and sold by tobacco companies. It does not include "traditional tobacco" used by Indigenous groups for religious or ceremonial purposes. - The term "LGBTQ+" is used on this page to refer to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, with the plus sign indicating inclusion of people who are queer, questioning, intersex, asexual, or who hold other gender/sex/romantic identities not specifically identified. Many studies cited on this page only looked at certain groups within the greater LGBTQ+ community. When single terms like "gay" or "lesbian," or acronyms like "LGB" are used on this page, this corresponds with how terms are used in the cited studies. More studies are needed to understand the ways that commercial tobacco and exposure affects other groups in the LGBTQ+ community. - McCabe SE, Hughes TL, Matthews AK, et al.

### [Youth Advisory Councils](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/yac/index.htm)


> Youth Advisory Councils Youth Advisory Councils (YACs) provide ongoing advice and support to school districts on policies and practices that affect students. Youth voices can make a difference. Youth can work with supportive adults to improve schools and communities. Youth advisory councils (YACs)—sometimes called youth advisory boards—allow youth and adults to make decisions together and have a positive influence on others. Youth can be empowered through youth advisory councils. YACs are formal groups that make decisions, advise others, or act to improve the schools and communities they serve. YACs offer opportunities for youth and adults to work together and build strong partnerships. They can blend youth points of view and experiences with that of adults to build strong partnerships. YACs give youth a voice in a program or an organization. Youth have the power to make decisions that shape their community and school environments. A well-designed and focused youth advisory council program is the key to success. Focus for Youth Advisory Councils Youth and adults work together in youth advisory councils to decide on their focus and goals. Many YACs focus on specific issues and populations. YACs might focus, for example, on preventing drug abuse, improving mental health, or decreasing sexual health risks. - YACs could focus on creating safe spaces for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning (LGBTQ+) youth, students with disabilities, and other youth within a specific school district. - YACs focused on decreasing the sexual health risks of students could inform education programs and counseling, testing, or treatment services for students. - YACs focused on increasing safety for LGBTQ+ youth should include LGBTQ+ youth on the council and focus on the issues those students care about. -

### [2024 Tips From Former Smokers Campaign Launch](https://snapshot2024.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/resources/feature/index.html)


> 2024 Tips From Former Smokers Campaign Launch People Featured in the 2024 Tips From Former SmokersĀ® Campaign Share Experiences with Menthol Cigarettes, Health Harms, and Quitting Journeys Angie P. started smoking menthol cigarettes at age 15. She explains in a new Tips From Former Smokers® (Tips®) TV ad that as a gay teen, trying to figure out who she was, she hid behind smoking. She continued to smoke for another 25 years, and this affected her career as a singer. Over time, she also became aware of tobacco companies’ aggressive marketing of cigarettes, including menthols. “My hope is to help other people, especially LGBTQ+ people, understand what the tobacco companies are trying to do with their advertising. I’d tell them it’s not worth it to smoke,” Angie said. “Their lives and their health are worth more.” Starting February 5, Angie and six other people will share their quit-smoking stories in the Tips campaign. The campaign will air new ads to inspire people who smoke to quit and promote free resources to help them if they need it. Angie P.: Love Yourself Tip The Tips campaign features more than 45 real people impacted by the serious long-term health effects from smoking and secondhand smoke exposure. Tips also shares stories from loved ones. They describe how taking care of someone living with a smoking-related condition has affected their own lives and health. The new people featured in the Tips campaign include: Angie P. smoked to fit in when she felt that people close to her would not accept her because she is gay. She wants to encourage other LGBTQ+ people who smoke to love themselves and get the help they need to quit. - Elizabeth B. started smoking menthol cigarettes at age 18. Years later, she had trouble walking because of smoking-related peripheral artery disease (PAD). She later developed kidney cancer. Her husband Stephen helps take care of her. - Ethan B. grew up seeing ads that made him think smoking menthol cigarettes was “cool.” As an adult, he had two smoking-related strokes which affected his memory. - John B. tried many strategies to try to quit smoking, but nothing seemed to work. He kept trying and finally succeeded when, with the help of his doctor, he found the methods that worked best for him. Those methods were counseling and using two FDA-approved quit-smoking medicines. - Noel S. smoked two packs a day for more than 20 years. He suffered a smoking-related heart attack at 36 years old. Noel quit smoking menthol cigarettes so he could be around to watch younger family members grow up. - Tammy W. thought that menthol cigarettes were less harmful than non-menthol cigarettes. She also thought she would avoid health harms if she continued eating healthy foods, exercising at the gym, and running every day. Tammy realized menthol cigarettes are just as dangerous as regular cigarettes when she discovered she had severe heart disease and had to have emergency open-heart surgery. - Several of the new ads focus on menthol cigarettes. Menthol is an ingredient added to many tobacco products. It creates a cooling sensation in the throat and airways, which makes smoking feel less harsh. Menthol in cigarettes can make them more appealing to young people and people who have never used tobacco products. Menthol also enhances the effects of nicotine on the brain and can make tobacco products even more addictive. Menthol in cigarettes can make it more difficult to quit smoking. In 2021, menthol cigarette sales made up 37% of all U.S. cigarette sales. Menthol cigarettes contribute to tobacco-related health disparities in the United States. Over the years, tobacco companies have used tailored advertising to market to many communities, including: African American Adults: In the 1950s, less than 10% of African American adults who smoked used menthol cigarettes. That percentage has risen to 85%, compared to 39% of the general population that smokes. The tobacco industry has used several tactics to market menthol cigarettes to African American communities. For example, tobacco companies have placed ads in Black-owned publications and in neighborhoods with more Black residents. - LGBTQ+ Communities: The tobacco industry has targeted the LGBTQ+ community for decades. Tobacco companies have sponsored events and offered bar promotions, giveaways, and advertisements that target LGBTQ+ people. More than 36% of LGBTQ+ adults who smoke use menthol cigarettes. - Women: Tobacco companies designed menthol cigarette packaging and ads in ways that appeal to women. Women who smoke are more likely to use menthol cigarettes than men who smoke. - Youth and Young Adults: Tobacco companies have targeted marketing to youth through advertisements, in-store signage, and sponsorships of community music events. Flavored tobacco products, including menthol flavors, appeal to youth. Menthol in cigarettes makes it more likely that youth and young adults will try smoking. Menthol in cigarettes also makes it more likely that youth who start smoking menthols will continue to smoke on a regular basis. - Quitting smoking is the single best way you can protect yourself and your family members, coworkers, friends, and others from the health risks of smoking and secondhand smoke exposure.

### [LGBTQ+ People Encounter Barriers to Quitting Successfully](https://snapshot2024.cdc.gov/tobacco/health-equity/lgbtq/quitting-tobacco.html)


> LGBTQ+ People Encounter Barriers to Quitting Successfully Most people who smoke want to quit, and more than half of them try to do so each year.3 Proven treatments, such as FDA-approved medicines and behavioral counseling, make it more likely that people will quit smoking successfully, but LGBTQ+ people who smoke run into barriers when trying to find and use these treatments: In a national study in 2009-2010, a lower percentage of gay, bisexual, and transgender men (66.7%) were aware of tobacco quitlines than their non GBT counterparts (83.9%), though quitline use was similar.41 - In a study of smoking adults in one state, lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults who were aware of their state quitline were less likely to report an intention to call the quitline than their heterosexual counterparts.42 - In 2015, fewer gay, lesbian, and bisexual adults who smoked reported using counseling and/or FDA-approved medication to help them quit than straight adults who smoked (14.5% vs 31.7%).43 - LGBTQ+ people often fear or experience discrimination or disrespect from medical professionals.44 People who are afraid of discrimination from doctors and other health workers are less likely to seek medical care, including preventive screenings. The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey found that nearly 1 in 4 transgender people (23%) reported avoiding looking for health care they needed in the past year because they were afraid of discrimination or mistreatment on the basis of gender identity.44 - LGBTQ+ people may rank tobacco use as a lower health priority than other issues that affect the LGBTQ+ community (e.g. HIV/AIDS, hate crimes, suicide).45 - Connecting every person who wants to quit with treatment proven to help them quit for good is important for improving people’s health. Provide barrier-free, widely promoted coverage for all evidence-based cessation treatments by all types of health insurance. For example, as of 2018, only 15 state Medicaid programs fully covered tobacco cessation (quitting) services for all enrollees of traditional Medicaid.46 Increase access to culturally tailored cessation services. When it comes to health issues, one size does not fit all. Different people and communities have varying needs and make decisions in different ways. For example, some LGBTQ+ people may think of smoking as a way of rebelling against traditional gender roles.47 Tailored cessation resources and improved access to these resources could be helpful, including acknowledgment that some experiences and stressors associated with smoking may be unique for LGBTQ+ people.48 Share health messages that feature LGBTQ+ people and their experiences. Mass media campaigns are proven to increase smoking cessation, prevent tobacco use initiation, and reduce the prevalence of tobacco use.7,49 However, anti-smoking messages rarely appear in media designed for LGBTQ+ people.48 Anti-commercial tobacco* messaging and mass media campaigns can feature testimonials from LGBTQ+ people.48 CDC’s Tips From Former Smokers® (Tips®) is one example of a campaign that has done this. Educational and outreach campaigns should consistently include and reach out to LGBTQ+ people.44 Cornelius ME, Loretan CG, Wang TW, Jamal A, Homa DM.

### [LGBTQ+ People Experience a Health Burden from Commercial Tobacco](https://snapshot2024.cdc.gov/tobacco/health-equity/lgbtq/health-burden.html)


> LGBTQ+ People Experience a Health Burden from Commercial Tobacco In 2020, 16.1% of lesbian, gay, or bisexual adults smoked cigarettes – compared with 12.3% of heterosexual/straight adults. Use of any commercial tobacco* product was also higher among lesbian, gay, or bisexual adults, compared to heterosexual/straight adults (25.1% vs 18.8%).1 - Transgender adults are more likely to currently use a commercial tobacco product than adults who are not transgender (cisgender). The prevalence of e-cigarette use among trans adults is more than 4 times the prevalence among cis adults (21.3% transgender vs. 5.0% cisgender).2 - In 2021, 17.4% of gay, lesbian, or bisexual high school students currently used any tobacco product – compared to 11.4% of heterosexual high school students.3 - Among middle school students, any current tobacco product use was 3 times higher for gay, lesbian, or bisexual youth than heterosexual.3 - About 1 in 5 lesbian, gay, or bisexual middle and high school students currently used electronic cigarettes in 2020 compared to about 1 in 8 heterosexual students.4 - - Lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults have more risk factors for cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) disease – like high blood pressure – than straight adults.5,6 Cigarette smoking can cause cardiovascular disease.7 - Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer in all Americans and is linked to at least 11 other types of cancer.7 Given that an estimated 45,000 LGBTQ+ people die from cancer each year,8 it is important to understand the causes of cancer in this population. - Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) are the population group most affected by HIV in the US, with MSM accounting for 69% of all new HIV diagnoses.9,10 People living with HIV, including those who have access to freely available and well-organized HIV treatment, now lose more years of life from smoking than from HIV.11 - More details on some of the reasons for these health disparities—and the public health measures that can improve health equity for LGBTQ+ people—are in this website section. † The term “LGBTQ+” is used on this page to refer to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, with the plus sign indicating inclusion of people who are queer, questioning, intersex, asexual, or who hold other gender/sex/romantic identities not specifically identified. Many studies cited on this page only looked at certain groups within the greater LGBTQ+ community. When single terms like “gay” or “lesbian,” or acronyms like “LGB” are used on this page, this corresponds with how terms are used in the cited studies. More studies are needed to understand the ways that commercial tobacco and exposure affects other groups in the LGBTQ+ community. Cornelius ME, Loretan CG, Wang TW, Jamal A, Homa DM.

> LGBTQ+ People and Commercial Tobacco: Health Disparities and Ways to Advance Health Equity Everyone deserves a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible. This is called health equity. Achieving health equity means addressing systemwide problems, unfair practices, and unjust conditions that have a negative impact on the health of specific groups. In order to achieve health equity, we work to eliminate health disparities. Health disparities are differences in health outcomes that are closely linked with social, economic, and/or environmental factors, among LGBTQ+ people.† To improve health equity, we must consider the role of commercial tobacco*. How LGBTQ+ people experience a health burden from commercial tobacco How they harm LGBTQ+ people and drive health disparities How LGBTQ+ people encounter these barriers and strategies that can be used to help quit smoking

> LGBTQ+ Youth: Addressing Health Disparities with a School-Based Approach Many lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ+) youth face social stigma about their sexual choices or identities. Stigma can take many forms, such as discrimination, harassment, family rejection, social rejection, or violence. For LGBTQ+ youth, these experiences can put their health at risk. Mental Health and Suicidal Behaviors While poor mental health is a common problem for youth, it is reported far more often by LGBQ+ youth. In 2021, 69% of LGBQ+* youth reported feeling persistently sad and hopeless. For heterosexual youth, that figure was 35%. - During the pandemic, LGBQ+ high students were about 4 times more likely to attempt suicide than their heterosexual peers. - Although the pandemic made these disparities worse, they have been persistent over time. - * Not all data sets include data on transgender and/or questioning youth. The “T” and “Q” are not used when referring to these data. LGB and LGBQ+ are used as appropriate. Experiences with Violence LGBTQ+ high school students experience more violence than their heterosexual peers—both at school and at home. LGBQ+ youth consistently report higher rates of bullying, being threatened or injured with a weapon, and dating violence. They are also more likely to miss school because of safety concerns. - Disparities are particularly pronounced in the areas of sexual violence. LGBQ+ students are four times as likely to experience forced sex. - During the pandemic, 20% of LGBQ+ students said they had been physically abused by a parent or other adult in their home. For heterosexual students, that figure was 10%. - Risk for HIV Many youth in the U.S. are living with HIV, and LGBTQ+ youth are the most affected. 23% of new HIV diagnoses are among young men ages 13-24, most of whom identify as gay or bisexual. - Despite the higher risk, only 7% of LGBQ+ students have ever been tested for HIV. - Many students don’t get inclusive health education. About 51% of schools nationwide provide information on HIV, STDs, or pregnancy prevention that’s relevant to LGBTQ+ students. - What Schools Can Do LGBTQ+ youth often feel less connected at school. Research shows that when students feel connected to a supportive school community, they do better socially, emotionally, and academically. When schools implement LGBTQ+-supportive policies and practices, all students experience less: Emotional distress - Violence and harassment - Suicidal behaviors - CDC’s What Works in Schools program has identified inclusive practices that benefit both LGBTQ+ students and their heterosexual peers. They include: Establishing Gender and Sexuality Alliances (GSA) - Conducting professional development for school staff on inclusivity - Identifying safe spaces - Implementing anti-harassment policies -
### [Protective Factors for LGBTQ Youth](https://snapshot2024.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/disparities/protective-factors-for-lgbtq-youth.htm)


> Protective Factors for LGBTQ Youth Information for Health and Education Professionals Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ) youth are more likely to experience poor health than their heterosexual (straight) or cisgender peers.1-4 Supporting the health of LGBTQ youth has usually involved trying to understand and reduce factors that increase their risk. Much less attention has been paid to protective factors—the characteristics, conditions, and behaviors that directly improve positive health outcomes or reduce the effects of stressful life events and other risk factors. Funding from the Arcus Foundation to the CDC Foundation supported the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH) to review the published literature on protective factors for LGBTQ youth to identify gaps and opportunities for research and intervention. DASH focused on factors that promote sexual health for LGBTQ (i.e., sexual minority) youth. For transgender youth, we considered a broader set of factors that promote mental health and academic success in addition to sexual health. This page summarizes key findings that can strengthen programs and research that support LGBTQ youth. What research has been done? Very little research was found on sexual health-related protective factors for LGBTQ youth age 15-24 years. A search for articles about individual-level factors (things like knowledge, attitudes and skills) that promote positive sexual health outcomes for LGBTQ youth identified 20 articles reporting on 12 studies.5 A second search for articles about relationship-level protective factors (things like how people communicate with partners and parents) for the sexual health of LGBTQ youth identified 42 articles reporting on 32 studies.6 Most of this research on LGBTQ youth looks at young gay and bisexual men and does not include young lesbian, bisexual, and other women who have sex with women.5,6 Only 21 articles, reporting on the results of 19 studies, addressed protective factors that support sexual and mental health and positive education outcomes for transgender and other gender diverse youth.7 The published articles looked at a variety of different factors; however, many of these factors only appeared in one or two studies. Some factors that have been found to be protective for heterosexual youth were not studied at all. While most studies of individual-level factors focused on beliefs and attitudes; only a few considered skills and competencies. Opportunities for Researchers To guide programs, we need more research on protective factors for LGBTQ youth. Based on the gaps identified in the DASH reviews, the following is needed: More research on protective factors for young lesbian, bisexual, and other women who have sex with women - Examination of differences between young bisexual men and women and their gay and lesbian peers - Designed and implemented longitudinal studies - Consistent measurement of potential protective factors affecting LGBTQ youth health - Examination of LGBTQ youth’s skills and competencies related to sexual health promotion - Examination of LGBTQ youth’s relationships with medical providers and other trusted adults - What factors are protective? Given the limits of existing research, it is hard to say what factors promote sexual health and positive outcomes among LGBTQ youth. However, some factors had protective effects in multiple studies. For gay and bisexual young men, these include: Positive attitudes about condoms, such as thinking that condoms are pleasurable or important for healthy relationships. - Increased peer group acceptance of safer sex, meaning that friends support condom use and other behaviors that reduce risk. - For transgender youth, these include: Acceptance and support from parents and peers, particularly when it comes to sexual orientation and gender identity. - Gay-straight alliances, which are student-led clubs that provide a safe place for students to support each other around issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity. - What can health and education professionals do? Health and education professionals engaged in practice or research should pay more attention to protective factors for LGBTQ youth. In addition to reducing risk, developing the assets of LGBTQ youth gives them resources to successfully navigate challenges. The articles included in the reviews and the broader literature suggest promising practices for doing so. Health and education professionals working to support programs in community and school settings can promote: Positive youth development. Positive youth development (PYD) involves strengthening protective factors, including skills, competencies and supportive relationships. PYD programs have improved sexual health8 and should be open and welcoming to LGBTQ youth. Resources on PYD are available via youth.gov. - Inclusive sexual health education. Sex education that is relevant to LGBTQ youth can increase their ability to use condoms and talk with their partner about safer sex.9 - Gay-straight alliances. Gay-straight alliances (GSAs) have been found to help LGBTQ youth as well as heterosexual, cisgender youth.10,11 The Genders Sexualities Alliance Network has developed tools for creating and supporting GSAs. - Parent engagement. Family acceptance has been linked to positive health outcomes for sexual and gender minority youth.12,13 The Family Acceptance Project offers resources to strengthen family support of LGBTQ youth. - Johns, M.

> LGBTQ+ Travelers CDC Yellow Book 2024 Preparing International TravelersLesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ+) travelers share many of the same hopes and desires as other people when traveling: to have a safe, happy, and memorable trip. LGBTQ+ travelers have similar risk-taking behaviors as other travelers, which are influenced more by age, gender, socioeconomic status, mental health considerations, and substance use, rather than sexual attraction or identity. LGBTQ+ travelers face some unique risks, however, and clinicians counseling them should tailor their advice accordingly. Overview LGBTQ+ travelers contribute greatly to economic development and can convey powerful positive messages related to human rights worldwide. The United Nations World Trade Organization Second Global Report on LGBTQ+ Tourism in 2017 acknowledged that LGBTQ+ persons travel more frequently, demonstrate higher than average spending patterns, and demonstrate brand awareness and loyalty. LGBTQ+ travelers have long been aware of gay-friendly destinations in the United States, including Provincetown, Massachusetts, and Fire Island, New York; and in Europe, including Mykonos, Greece, and Sitges, Spain. Human rights have improved in some countries, and the international tourism industry has become more responsive to LGBTQ+ travelers; many international travel destinations are now recognized as gay friendly. Open for Business is a coalition of leading global companies dedicated to LGBTQ+ inclusion, and recognizes the powerful advantages of inclusive, diverse societies that improve economic, business, and individual performance. The travel industry has long recognized that marketing to the LGBTQ+ community makes economic sense; the International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association was founded in 1983, and provides free travel resources and information, while working to promote quality and safety for LGBTQ+ travelers worldwide. LGBTQ+ travelers are as diverse as other travelers in terms of how, where, and with whom they prefer to travel; risk-taking behavior; gender expression; skin color; citizenship; and income. In a 2015 study conducted by Global Marketing, behavior of gay men travelers differed from lesbian travelers in several ways: gay men were more likely to travel with other adults, visit gay bars, and have more disposable time and income; lesbian travelers were more likely to travel with family, be more interested in child-friendly rather than LGBTQ+ friendly environments, and have travel preferences and budget constraints more closely aligned to people who are not LGTBQ+ than to gay men. People who are transgender might be more likely to travel for medical reasons, seeking high-quality and affirmational medical and surgical care. Technology also has changed how LGBTQ+ travelers interact with others while traveling. In one study, 31% of gay men use dating apps while traveling, compared with 4% of lesbian travelers and 15% of all Americans. Men who used the internet to set up dates prior to travel reported far more sexual partners and were much more likely to report having sex with a new partner. There is no single standard message for counseling the LGBTQ+ traveler (see Box 2-14). During the pretravel consultation with LGBTQ+ travelers, include routine travel advice and specific counseling tailored to the itinerary and planned activities (see Sec. 2, Ch. 1, The Pretravel Consultation). Focused counseling for the LGBTQ+ traveler should include, at a minimum, a discussion of infectious disease risks, legal considerations, safety and security issues, and screening and counseling for potential mental health problems and substance use disorders. Box 2-14 Counseling LGBTQ+ travelers: a checklist for clinicians â Assess each patient’s travel-related risk behaviors â Ask direct questions regarding sexual identity and behavior â Consider screening people at risk for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and HIV infection per national guidelines â Discuss diseases specific to sexual practices and use of gloves and dental dams â Provide clear counseling and online resources (Table 2-13) regarding legal, cultural, and safety issues â Provide direct advice on safer sex and sexually transmitted infection prevention, including consistent condom use and HIV preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis â Provide nonjudgmental and detailed counseling specific to LGBTQ+ travelers’ risks â Update vaccines per schedules, including hepatitis A, hepatitis B, human papillomavirus, and others, as appropriate Infectious Disease Counseling A paucity of research data on LGBTQ+ travelers has been published; a 2021 English language, no date filter, PubMed search found only 41 articles, 30 of which focused on men who have sex with men (MSM) and 2 of which were case reports concerning transgender travelers (1 on genital dermatitis, the other on deep venous thrombosis). Studies have been reported on MSM from Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, India, Sweden, Vietnam and those going to Mardi Gras in New Orleans or Key West, Florida, but no studies specific to lesbian travelers have been published. A 2019 review article on MSM who travel provides advice for clinicians counseling this specific patient population. Studies on MSM behavior while traveling show mixed results—some engage in more high-risk sexual behavior during travel, and some less. A greater risk for acquisition of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has been shown in MSM who travel, use social apps or illicit drugs, engage in unprotected anal intercourse, join mass gatherings (including Gay Pride), and engage in circuit parties. In a meta-analysis of foreign travel and sexual behavior, the pooled rate of casual sex was 19.5% for all women and 24.8% for all men. In the same analysis, the rate of unprotected intercourse among women who had casual travel sex was 62.1% and 62.3% among men. The US Preventive Services Taskforce recommends behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolescents and for adults who are at increased risk for STIs. Provide nonjudgmental counseling to LGBTQ+ travelers. The Gay and Lesbian Medical Association has resources to assist clinicians counseling LGTBQ+ patients. Counsel travelers that safe sex is proven to reduce the risk of receiving or transmitting chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis A and B, HIV, human papillomavirus (HPV), pubic lice, and syphilis. Depending on a patient’s sexual risk behavior, counsel them on the use of condoms, dental dams, and gloves to reduce risk for STIs. See Sec. 9, Ch. 12, Sex & Travel, for general counseling recommendations on sex and travel. Enteric Infections Patients who engage in oral–anal sex might be unaware of their risk for acquiring enteric infections, both bacterial (e.g., Salmonella, Shigella) and parasitic (e.g., Blastocystis spp., Dientamoeba fragilis, Giardia). Counsel patients on use of dental dams and careful washing of hands and genitalia, before and after sex. Offer typhoid vaccination per national guidelines (see Sec. 5, Part 1, Ch. 24, Typhoid & Paratyphoid Fever). Hepatitis A Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is transmitted via the fecal–oral route during person-to-person sexual contact and from contaminated food and water. Hepatitis A outbreaks have been reported among MSM. Counsel LGBTQ+ travelers on safer sex, including the use of dental dams, and recommend HAV vaccination. Hepatitis B Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted via percutaneous or mucus membrane exposure to body fluids infected with HBV. MSM have a higher seroprevalence of HBV; offer vaccination to this group irrespective of travel plans. Consider screening for HBV infection in high-risk, previously unvaccinated travelers, including MSM. Hepatitis C Hepatitis C virus is generally transmitted via parenteral routes but can be transmitted sexually. Hepatitis C outbreaks have been reported among MSM and have been associated with unprotected anal intercourse, genital ulcerative disease, and traumatic sexual practices (e.g., fisting [inserting a hand in the rectum]). Counsel patients on safer sex practices, including the use of condoms and gloves. HIV Assess sexual risk behavior and counsel travelers, including people at risk for sexual assault, on use of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). Remind patients that long-term travel, particularly for work, might require HIV testing. Countries might deny entry to people with evidence of HIV infection, and carrying PrEP might be mistaken as evidence of such. See Sec. 5, Part 2, Ch. 11, Human Immunodeficiency Virus / HIV, and Sec. 3, Ch. 1, Immunocompromised Travelers, for additional information. Human Papillomavirus Human papillomavirus (HPV) is highly prevalent among MSM. HPV infection is associated with penile, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers and precancers. Offer HPV vaccination per national guidelines. Invasive Meningococcal Disease Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is a risk for travelers going to the African meningitis belt and among Hajj pilgrims (see Sec. 5, Part 1, Ch. 13, Meningococcal Disease). Another, less well-known group at risk for IMD are MSM, who may have higher carriage rates for Neisseria meningitidis. Potential risk behaviors for IMD include regularly visiting crowded venues; traveling to mass gatherings (e.g., Gay Pride festivals); using illegal drugs; and having multiple sexual partners. Recommend vaccination for HIV-positive travelers. Some local public health authorities have also recommended routine vaccination against meningococcal disease for MSM. Legal Considerations LGBTQ+ travelers face unique legal issues and risks while traveling abroad. Many countries have made strides toward combating discrimination against LGBTQ+ persons, but many other countries continue to discriminate against and abuse LGBTQ+ persons. Over 70 countries still consider consensual same-sex sexual relations a crime that can carry severe punishment, including the death penalty. Many countries do not legally recognize same-sex marriage or allow or recognize LGBTQ+ adoptions. Attitudes, even within countries with legal protections, will vary among people and communities where LGBTQ+ persons travel. The United Nations (UN) has been addressing human rights abuses of the LGBTQ+ community since the 1990s. In a 2015 speech, UN Deputy Commissioner for Human Rights Flavia Pansieri summarized the abuses of the LGBTQ+ community, including murder, rape, mob attacks, abuse by police and prison officials, criminal sanctions, arrest and imprisonment, blackmail and harassment, forced medications and surgeries in medical settings to try to change sexual orientation, forced sterilization of people who are transgender, humiliation, discrimination, job loss, evictions, and refusal of medical treatment. Such issues are a reality in many countries, and clinicians should offer LGBTQ+ travelers resources on differing international laws, attitudes, and customs, and emphasize the realities of behavior constraints that can make a trip safer (Table 2-13). Travel health providers also should remind LGBTQ+ travelers that they are subject to the laws of any country to which they are traveling, and encourage travelers to read about their destinations before departure. The US Department of State annually publishes Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, which includes a detailed, country-by-country report of issues pertinent to the LGBTQ+ community and offers the printable LGBTQ+ Family Travel Tips pocket card at their website (see Table 2-13 for the website address). Table 2-13 Online resources for LGBTQ+ travelers ORGANIZATION| RESOURCE| EQUALDEX | Gay and Lesbian Medical Association | International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association | ILGA World: International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association | National Alliance on Mental Illness | National Center for Transgender Equality | The Trevor Project: Saving Young LGBTQ Lives | US Department of State | LGBTI Family Travel Tips [PDF] | Safety & Security A general approach to travel safety and security is outlined in Sec. 4, Ch. 11, Safety & Security Overseas. As with many travelers, the joy of feeling more freedom to express oneself while traveling, coupled with substance use, could result in behaviors that put travelers at risk. Each traveler’s perception of and willingness to accept risk also varies (see Sec. 2, Ch. 2, . . . perspectives: Travelers’ Perception of Risk). LGBTQ+ travelers should be aware that gay-friendly neighborhoods might not reflect societal acceptance and safety in a country overall. LGBTQ+ persons have a lifetime of experience assessing situations to determine whether they can safely be themselves. When traveling, LGBTQ+ persons should be aware of sociocultural differences that can affect their true situational safety. The US Department of State notes that authorities in some countries could be involved in entrapment campaigns, with law enforcement monitoring websites, mobile phone apps, or meeting places. Counsel patients to be cautious connecting with the local community. The US Department of State offers tips for the LGBTQ+ community for staying safe while abroad, including researching destinations, updating passports, packing important documents, living abroad with a foreign national spouse or partner, visa issues, and adoption issues. Advise transgender travelers that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) offers specific screening considerations for transgender passengers, including information on reporting prostheses or discrimination at screening checkpoints, at the TSA website. Although published data are lacking, media reports suggest that people who are openly lesbian, whether single or coupled, and people who are transgender might be at greater risk for physical and sexual assault worldwide. LGBTQ+ travelers should contact the nearest US embassy or consulate if they have troubles while abroad; the Department of State website assures travelers that consular officers will protect their privacy and will not generalize, make assumptions, or pass judgment. Mental Health & Substance Use LGBTQ+ identity can be a source of strength and courage for many, but the lack of acceptance, overt discrimination, rejection, and denial of rights can lead to or exacerbate mental health issues among this population. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults are more than twice as likely as other adults to experience a mental health condition, and people who are transgender are >4 times more likely to experience a mental health condition than people who are cisgender (persons whose gender identity corresponds with their birth sex). Adolescents and young adults are at particularly high risk for suicide, and LGBTQ+ youth are more than twice as likely to experience persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness than their peers who are not LGTBQ+. Transgender youth face further disparities and are twice as likely to experience depressive symptoms, seriously consider suicide, and attempt suicide compared with cisgender lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, and questioning youth. LGBTQ+ adults are twice as likely to experience a substance use disorder, and people who are transgender are 4 times as likely. Heavy drinking, binge drinking, tobacco use, and use of illicit drugs, including amyl nitrate (known as poppers), cannabis, MDMA (known as ecstasy or Molly), and amphetamines are more common in segments of the LGBTQ+ community. Several studies outline the association of recreational drug use with riskier sexual behavior during travel, including unprotected anal intercourse in MSM. As outlined in Sec. 2, Ch. 12, Mental Health, travel medicine providers should screen for depression and anxiety in people planning extended or frequent travel; participants in humanitarian or disaster relief work; and anyone intending to take up long-term or semipermanent residence in another country. Little research and no published guidelines are available on LGBTQ+ travelers and mental health or substance abuse outcomes during and after travel, but the available data on prevalence of mental health issues and substance use suggest screening is appropriate for all LGBTQ+ travelers, including adolescents, for both mental health and substance use or abuse concerns. Mpox In May 2022, a multinational outbreak of monkeypox (mpox) began; 3 months later (by the end of August) it involved people from >90 countries. During the outbreak, the causative agent, monkeypox virus (see Sec. 5, Part 2, Ch. 22, Smallpox & Other Orthopoxvirus-Associated Infections), spread person-to-person primarily through close skin-to-skin (including sexual) contact. Most cases occurred among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men; international travel played a role in introducing the virus to new countries. Remind all travelers that sex with new partners can increase their risk of contracting infections, including mpox. People at risk of mpox exposure and infection during travel should complete mpox vaccination series at least two weeks prior to departure. Refer susceptible travelers who have been exposed to mpox for vaccination, as soon as possible (ideally within 4 days of exposure) to help prevent the disease or make it less severe.

### [Community is Key to Success of Vaccination Outreach Held at LGBTQ+ and Pride Events](https://blogs.cdc.gov/healthequity/2022/11/15/community-is-key-to-success-of-vaccination-outreach-held-at-lgbtq-and-pride-events/?replytocom=2964)


> Community is Key to Success of Vaccination Outreach Held at LGBTQ+ and Pride Events Posted on bySince August 2022, CDC has worked with communities to provide monkeypox vaccines to the public through innovative channels, including LGBTQ+ events. In planning for these events, CDC worked closely with state and local health departments to vaccinate everyone who wished to be vaccinated before and during each LGBTQ+ event, including impromptu vaccination clinics at bars and clubs catering to the LGBTQ+ community. These events provided an ideal opportunity to offer monkeypox vaccine to gay and bisexual men, a population disproportionately affected by monkeypox. With CDC’s support, state and local health departments provided monkeypox vaccines at events in cities across the country, including New Orleans, Atlanta, Charlotte, Oakland, Phoenix, Honolulu, and Boise. While each event was unique, they all had one thing in common—community organizations were critical partners essential for establishing trust among event attendees and encouraging them to get vaccinated. Stories from these events offer insights into how public health and community organizations can work together to support vaccination efforts in the future. Southern Decadence in New Orleans Southern Decadence, described as “Gay Mardi Gras,” attracts more than 250,000 visitors to New Orleans each year. CDC responded to a request from the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) and New Orleans Health Department to support their vaccination efforts before and during the Southern Decadence festival because monkeypox cases were on the rise in the United States in June and July 2022. The goal of these efforts was to reach people most affected by monkeypox in Louisiana. Given that Black Louisianans represent 59 percent of reported monkeypox cases identified in the state, it was critical to bring resources directly to the people who needed them. LDH and partners hosted 24 community vaccination events across the state, including 13 vaccine events in New Orleans, in the weeks leading up to the festival. Many of these events were held at venues frequented by Black gay, bisexual, and same-gender loving men. In addition, CDC worked with state, private, and community partners to set up the Southern Decadence Health Hub at a central venue within three blocks of the main festival area. The Health Hub offered monkeypox vaccines, clinical consultations, testing, and health education, along with COVID-19 bivalent vaccines and COVID-19 home test kits. In total, nearly 7,000 doses of monkeypox vaccine were administered at public and private health clinics and community vaccination events before and during the Southern Decadence festival. Atlanta Black Pride Black men represent 78 percent of reported monkeypox cases in Georgia. Atlanta Black Pride (ABP) weekend attracts over 125,000 people, and the 2022 event presented an ideal opportunity to put health equity into action by offering monkeypox vaccine to event attendees. At the invitation of the Georgia Department of Public Health (Georgia DPH), CDC supported the state’s response and prevention efforts by allocating 5,500 additional vaccine doses for ABP attendees. Georgia DPH’s collaboration with ABP organizers, local health departments, community-based organizations, and night club and bar staff was critical to the success of this event because they directly engaged and encouraged attendees to get vaccinated. In total, more than 4,200 doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine were administered at events leading up to and during ABP weekend. Nearly half of vaccine recipients were Black, and eight percent were Hispanic or Latino. CDC and the Georgia DPH planned for additional vaccine events so people vaccinated for monkeypox before and during ABP were able to receive their second doses in the series. ￼ Charlotte Pride Charlotte Pride is the city’s largest street festival and parade, attracting more than 200,000 people each year. As of August 2022, almost all of North Carolina’s monkeypox cases were in gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, and 70 percent of reported cases were among Black men. CDC worked with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services and the Mecklenburg County Health Department to make sure there would be enough supply to accommodate all festival attendees who wished to be vaccinated. Partnerships with community-based organizations, key influencers on social media, respected members of the clergy, and diverse night club promoters were especially helpful in reaching diverse populations. Ultimately, the Mecklenburg County Health Department vaccinated administered 540 doses at a series of festival events, clinics, and non-traditional settings, such as private parties, bars, and clubs. These stories demonstrate how critical it is for public heath institutions to coordinate with the communities they want to help. They highlight the value of connections between health departments and community-based organizations. Relationships with non-traditional venues serving affected populations , such as night clubs, bars, and special event facilities, were also important. Public health officials should consider collaborating with organizations that cater to affected populations when planning future vaccine outreach. How is your community engaging with community-based organizations to prevent monkeypox?

> Grants in Action: Building Community between LGBTQ+ Youth during COVID-19 Posted on byAs a 15 year-old in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the last things I expected to do was helping to run a $20,000 grant! As a member of Oregon’s Multnomah County Youth Action Council (YAC), I applied for the grant with our amazing YAC facilitator, Nicole Mayer. As YAC members, we decided to use the grant funding to create a youth-led podcast, “All in My Head,” dedicated to suicide prevention. Somehow, I found myself podcasting alongside a team of young people who had a shared goal of promoting mental health resources for young LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, plus other sexual and gender minorities) and BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) identifying folks. This was a transformative experience for me. The podcast gave me a platform to share my experiences, find community with other youth, and have honest conversations related to our mental health. To develop All in My Head, we built a team of over 20 young people who took on various leadership roles in the podcast project. We led outreach and recruitment, performed interviews, did the recording and editing, and shared the podcast on social media and other platforms. Because of the grant funding I helped apply for, we were even able to provide gift cards to support the time and contributions of everyone involved, which further supported our team’s commitment to equity and made me feel even more valued and motivated to continue producing quality content. In All in My Head, we are talking about complex issues such as the intersection of our queer identities and our religions, the use of acronyms like BIPOC, and our opinions on the importance of behavioral health in our schools. We intentionally built a diverse youth-led podcast team with varied life experiences. With each episode, my fellow podcasters and I gave voice to what is usually only in our heads. I talked about difficult topics like my coming out story, addiction, and therapy. While these stories were hard to share, my hope is that sharing my experience will help to normalize the discussion of these stigmatized topics. As the COVID-19 pandemic subsided, we, as the podcast team, attended in-person community events to connect with LGBTQ+ youth face-to-face. This facilitated more two-way conversations and was one of my favorite parts of the project. As I gained experience podcasting and using grant funding, I encountered other opportunities to get involved in suicide prevention work. With Place Matters Oregon, I helped create a video project that looked at mental health among LGBTQ+ youth in rural areas of Oregon. This was highly impactful for me coming from an urban area; I hadn’t understood some of the struggles from lacking support in your community and how crucial social connectedness is. This was a truly moving video project that demonstrated the importance of having a safe place to be yourself. The $20,000 grant came from funding received by the Oregon Health Authority from CDC National Center of Injury Prevention and Control’s Core State Injury Prevention Program. Oregon Health Authority put out a call for organizations serving the LGBTQ+ community to apply for funding using a low-barrier application process to promote accessibility, inclusion, and equity. In addition to All in My Head, 20 other community-led projects were funded—all using a protective factors approach to injury and violence prevention. We invite you to explore other funded projects like the OUT Dance Project and visit the Oregon LGBTQ Youth & Family Resources. Core State Injury Prevention Program (Core SIPP) uses evidence-based public health strategies, practices, and policies to support state health departments, like Oregon Health Authority, build their functional capacity to translate injury prevention research into public health actions. Learn more about Core SIPP and what other funded recipients are doing, Core SIPP: States in Action.

Lane would like to extend a huge thanks to those who made this project possible: the Oregon Alliance to Prevent Suicide in partnership with the Association of Oregon Community Mental Health Programs, the Oregon Health Authority’s Injury & Violence Prevention Program, and the Multnomah County Youth Action Council’s amazing youth group facilitator, Nicole Mayer. Nicole helped guide this project from the beginning and was an invaluable mentor and friend for so many who were part of this podcast.

> Understanding Youth Violence We Can Prevent Youth Violence Youth violence is one form of violence that young people experience. Youth violence affects all of us. If we want positive change, we must work together to create it. Youth violence is: A widespread but preventable public health problem that negatively affects youth, families, and communities The intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, by or against youth ages 10 to 24 An adverse childhood experience (ACE) and type of community violence that can have serious and lasting effects on a young person's physical, mental, and social health Youth violence includes: Fighting - Bullying - Threats with weapons - Gang-related violence - Addressing Root Causes Can Help Prevent Violence Addressing root causes, including racism and other social determinants of health, is critical to preventing violence in communities. Social Determinants of Health:1,2 Are the conditions where people live, work, play, worship, and learn that affect their health and quality of life - Vary widely for youth because of unequal access to resources and opportunities - Help us understand how unequal access to resources and opportunities can increase risk factors for violence - Racism:3 Is an example of a social determinant of health; it impacts other conditions that affect health risks - Includes structures, policies, practices, and norms that assign value and determine opportunity based on how people look or the color of their skin - Has profound impacts on youth of color, especially those who live in communities of color, and the violence they experience - We all share responsibility for fostering safe, healthy, communities where all youth can thrive. Effective violence prevention efforts consider the societal conditions experienced by youth and address the root causes. Health Inequities in Youth Violence Some youth are at greater risk of experiencing violence than others. LGBTQ+ youth are more likely to experience multiple forms of violence compared to their peers who are straight and identify with the gender assigned to them at birth.4,5,6 - Over 1 in 4 LGBTQ+ students report being electronically bullied each year, compared to about 1 in 9 straight students. 9 in 20 LGBTQ+ students experienced electronic harassment, or cyberbullying, via text messages or social media posts. Over 17 in 20 LGBTQ+ students were harassed or assaulted at school. 7 in 20 transgender students reported being bullied at school. Black youth are also at higher risk of experiencing serious physical violence ( such as homicides, fights with injuries, or aggravated assaults) compared with White youth.7,8,9Homicide continues to be the leading cause of death for non-Hispanic Black youth - - Youth who identify as a racial or ethnic minority as well as LGBTQ+ may also experience greater risk for violence.6,10 - 2 in 5 LGBTQ+ students of color were bullied or harassed based on race or ethnicity at school. 2 in 5 Native and indigenous LGBTQ+ students experienced both anti-LGBTQ+ and racist harassment at school. Thousands of youth experience violence every day Youth Violence is common Nearly 1 in 5 high school students reported being bullied on school property in the past year.11 More than 1 in 5 reported being in a physical fight in the past year.12 Nearly 1 in 6 reported being bullied through texting or social media.11 About 1 in 8 reported carrying a weapon on at least 1 day during the last 30 days.12 About 1 in 10 did not go to school because of safety concerns on at least one of the last 30 days.12 Youth violence kills and injures. Homicideis the second leading cause of death for youth ages 10-247,11 - Every day,About 19 youth die from homicide13 - Emergency departments treat more than 800 youth per day, or nearly 20 school buses full of youth, for physical assault-related injuries - - Youth violence is costly. Every year, homicides and injuries from physical assault result in about $20 billion in medical and lost productivity costs.7 Youth violence negatively impacts health, financial burden, well-being, and safety for youth, their families, and communities. Youth violence is preventable. We all share responsibility for fostering safe, healthy communities. Strategies that promote equitable, healthy development and environments14 include: Connecting young people to caring adults and activities Strengthening individualsâ and familiesâ financial security Providing all youth and young adults with quality education Promoting family environments where youth can grow up with their social, emotional, and educational needs met Creating safe, healthy, and supportive environments for youth and young adults Providing trauma informed services, mental and behavioral health treatment, and community support services to address violence and its consequences and prevent future risk Communities Can Act Now Communities can empower youth by providing leadership opportunities and activities. Directly engaging with youth can create stronger communities and help youth: Make healthy choices Be a leader and voice for change for healthier communities and schools Advise community and school-decision makers Promote respect and empathy with family, friends, and peers
