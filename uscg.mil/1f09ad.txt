Commandant: Celebrate Pride Month by “living your truth” This June the Coast Guard commemorates Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and others (LGBTQ+) Pride Month with the theme, “Living Our Truth”, which celebrates the diverse spectrum of identities within the LGBTQ+ community and acknowledges the ongoing work to secure the liberty entitled to every American. For much of our Nation’s history LGBTQ+ people were disenfranchised and forced to hide the truth of their gender or sexual orientation, or risk discrimination, hate, and violence. “Pride”, the slogan for the march held in New York City on the first anniversary of Stonewall Uprising, became the rallying cry for members of the LGBTQ+ community to publicly express their personal dignity, a pivotal sea change that helped launch the gay rights movement. Members of the LGBTQ+ community have served and continue to serve with distinction at all levels in government. The past service of LGBTQ+ people in the U.S. military is often unknown to history due to the laws that forced them to either hide their affiliations or be discharged. Today’s members and recruits know they will not face that past level of discrimination as they serve the Nation. LGBTQ+ people are critical members of our Coast Guard workforce and today we can celebrate their contributions to missions past and present. Every one of us plays a vital role in upholding a strong service culture where every person can serve in workplaces free from discrimination and harassment and perform their duty to the best of their ability. We can show support for our LGBTQ+ colleagues by educating ourselves, strengthening service culture, reaffirming our commitment to inclusion, and by using the resources available at the following pages: https://www.history.com/news/stonewall-riots-facts-gay-rights-lgbt https://www.deomi.mil/Special-Observances/#pride-month -USCG-
