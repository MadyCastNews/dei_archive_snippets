This year, more than 500 anti-LGBT bills have been sponsored in states across the country. In this climate, LGBTQ+ youth are quickly losing access to critical resources, supportive programming, and spaces of belonging. In addition, many caring adults, mentors, child welfare providers, educators, and youth serving organizations are unsure of what, if anything, they can do to affirm LGBTQ+ young people in their care. In this webinar, Dr. Christian Rummell and Nia Clark, MSW will highlight steps your mentoring program can take to create a more inclusive and affirming program climate for LGBTQ+ youth in your care. This session highlights guidance from the LGBTQ+ Supplement to the Elements of Effective Practice for Mentoring and contains tools, resources, and a roadmap for organizational policy change. This is part three of the three-part Collaborative Mentoring Webinar Series focused on mentoring LGBTQ+ youth.
