Course Details CL232 Equal Access: LGBTQ+ Inclusion and Resident Leadership Resident leaders know equity, and they know their communities. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other people with diverse sexual and gender identities (LGBTQ+) are active members of every community. Resident leaders working with LGBTQ+ people should be aware of some of the unique experiences of these neighbors and partners. In general, LGBTQ+ people experience relatively high rates of housing and financial insecurity over their lives due to inconsistent legal protections, discrimination, and other systemic barriers. That reality is amplified for LGBTQ+ people with intersecting identities that have been historically blocked from societal opportunitiesâ€”such as youth, seniors, and Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and Asian people. But LGBTQ+ people also have a rich history of resilience, strength, cultural diversity, and pride. Join us as we explore how to invest in LGBTQ+ resident leaders while being better allies ourselves.
