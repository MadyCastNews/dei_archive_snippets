Javits building in Manhattan. The Ali Forney Center has been heralded for their full continuum of care approach to services for LGBTQ homeless youth, and their founder, Carl Siciliano, was named a White House Champion of Change by President Obama citing the wide recognition AFC's programs have received for their quality and innovation. The performers made their work particularly relevant for HUD's staff, illustrating gaps in transitional and youth shelter programs and rules that can leave LGBTQ youth with limited options that lead to homelessness. The dialogue sparked by the performance was enhanced further when HUD employees had the chance to jump into scenes and take them in new directions, "rehearsing for life" as put by the troupe's leader.
