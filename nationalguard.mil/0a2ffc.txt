Missouri Recruiting and Retention Battalion, Missouri National Guard Burkhart joined the Guard more than 12 years ago at the age of 17. A highlight of her service was traveling with the 1231st Transportation Company over 10,000 miles across the central United States picking up and transporting dunnage. "Soldiers in the MOARNG are all different in many ways: gender, age, race, nationality, origin, religion, sexual orientation, political affiliation, medical status, etc. I am passionate about ensuring everyone, regardless of differences, are able to work together professionally in uniform to find a common ground to work together in unison to accomplish the mission at hand."
