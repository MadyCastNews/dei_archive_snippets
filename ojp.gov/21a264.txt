Award Information Description of original award (Fiscal Year 2024, $800,000) Cleveland Rape Crisis Center’s (CRCC) mission is to support survivors of rape and sexual abuse regardless of sexual orientation or age. This project will better equip CRCC to meet the needs of child sexual abuse victims and victims that are members of the LGBTQ+ community by increasing access, inclusivity, and innovation across Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake and Ashtabula Counties in Ohio. This project will allow CRCC to deliver on a focused strategic marketing effort to connect more survivors in marginalized communities across its footprint to services, support for a specifically located CRCC space to offer specialized programming, and ensuring existing spaces and functions have what they need to offer effective services and a safe, welcoming space to all – while also better serving children and families impacted by sexual violence. By improving CRCC’s capacity to reach and serve youth, families, and the LGBTQ+ community, this project will support CRCC’s capacity in serving all clients CRCC interacts with.
