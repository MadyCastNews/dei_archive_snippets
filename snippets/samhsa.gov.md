Diverse Populations [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.samhsa.gov/smvf-ta-center/diverse-populations)

> Diverse Populations Directory American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) Veterans - Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (AA and NHPIs) Veterans - Black Veterans - Hispanic and Latino Veterans - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer + (LGBTQ+) Veterans - Older Veterans - Rural and Agricultural Veterans - Women Veterans - Resources that Serve Multiple Diverse Populations - American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) Veterans American Indian people have served in the U.S. military in every major conflict for 200 years, at times at a higher rate than any other demographic. In the 20th century, more than 12,000 served in World War I; during World War II, over 44,000 served, including nearly 800 women (Understanding America: The Legacy of Native American Military Service). In addition to having served in every major conflict, according the Department of Defense, American Indians and Alaska Natives have one of the highest representations in the armed forces (VA: Native American Veterans). According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) “2023 National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report (PDF | 2 MB),” in 2021, the highest suicide rate was among AIAN veterans at 46.3 suicides per 100,000 AIAN veterans. Unique Challenges According to Mission Roll Call, there are a number of unique challenges for Tribal veterans. Even though three-quarters (74.3%) of AIAN service members are enrolled in VA healthcare, Indigenous veterans living in rural areas often have trouble accessing care because VA facilities are backlogged or far away. Coupled with combat-related wounds or illness, this can lead to further health disparities among Indigenous veterans. Religious stigmas are another challenge, which can impact the well-being of Indigenous veterans. Native American service members have often described military experiences as “spiritually isolating” due to judgments or ignorance around their unique customs. In fact, they were not legally allowed to practice their religion until 1978 with the passage of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (AIRFA), and limited faith services for Indigenous service members have persisted. Resources for AIAN Veterans SAMHSA’s Tribal Training and Technical Assistance Center This Center provides training and technical assistance to tribes and tribal organizations that provide behavioral health services. American Indian and Alaska Native Veterans: 2017 (PDF | 559 KB) In May 2020, VA published a report on AIAN veterans using data from 2017. This report provides comprehensive statistics on AIAN veterans through an examination of demographic, socioeconomic, and health status statistics. Association between Lifetime Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Past Year Alcohol Use Disorder among American Indians/Alaska Natives and Non-Hispanic Whites Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder disproportionately impact certain populations, including AIAN people. While PTSD and alcohol use disorder have been studied both separately and in tandem, less is known about the association in AIAN people. The objective of this study was to examine the association between lifetime PTSD and past-year alcohol use disorder among AIAN people and non-Hispanic White people. This article was published in 2017. Native American Veterans Association The Native American Veterans Association serves and honors men and women who have served active duty and their families through readjustment assistance, strengthening ties family ties, linkages to services, and career and educational training. Office of Tribal Affairs and Policy The Office of Tribal Affairs and Policy is an office within SAMHSA, which serves as the primary point of contact for tribal governments, tribal organizations, federal departments and agencies, and other governments and agencies on behavioral health issues facing AIAN people in the United States. Rural Promising Practice Issue Brief: Telemental Health Clinics for Rural Native American Veterans (PDF | 486 KB) The Promising Practices initiative is overseen by the VA Office of Rural Health as part of its targeted, solution-driven approach to increasing access to care for 3 million veterans living in rural communities who rely on VA for health care.

The website offers resources related to economic sustainability, the National Native American Veterans Memorial, access to care and benefits, and veterans’ resources at-a-glance. Veterans and Suicide Prevention—Indian Health Service The Indian Health Service and VA have partnered to improve access and service delivery to AIAN veterans. The webpage offers interactive resources, VA health benefit information, and publications and reports. Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (AA and NHPIs) Veterans Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) people have honorably served in the U.S. military since the War of 1812. Some of the most prestigious AANHPI military units of World War II include the 100th Infantry Battalion (composed of “Nisei,” or second-generation Japanese Americans); the Military Intelligence Service (Japanese American units of translators and interpreters); and 407th Air Service Squadron and 987th Signal Company (both composed of drafted Chinese Americans). AANHPI people also served in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, which was the most decorated unit for its size and length of service. In total about 14,000 men served, earning 9,486 Purple Hearts, 21 Medals of Honor, and 8 Presidential Unit Citations. Filipino service members played a key role as early as 1901, when the first Philippine Scout company was created. Their mission was to restore order and peace in troubled areas. In 1942, the first Filipino Battalion was formed. There were so many volunteers that a second Filipino Battalion was formed that same year (VA - Center for Minority Veterans, 2013 (PDF | 430 KB)). According to the VA’s 2023 National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report (PDF | 2 MB), in 2021 there were 31.6 suicides per 100,000 Asian, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander veterans Unique Challenges When providing supports for Asian Americans it is important to consider the different cultures, languages, and ethnicities that fit within the Asian population. The pan-ethnic term “Asian American” describes the population of about 22 million people living in the United States who trace their roots to more than 20 countries in East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent (Pew Research Center). In Mental Health of Asian American and Pacific Islander Military Veterans: Brief Review of an Understudied Group, the authors report that AANHPI veterans face many challenges, one of which is, “[AANHPI] veterans have poorer mental health than other veterans and are not receiving needed mental health services.” The National Alliance on Mental Health (NAMI) identified that “[AANHPI people] have the lowest help-seeking rate of any racial/ethnic group, with only 23.3 percent of [AANHPI] adults with a mental illness receiving treatment in 2019.” Some identified reasons for lower help seeking were systematic barriers for care, limited availability of quality treatment, and a lack of culturally competent care, such as providers who use a more holistic approach. Resources for AANHPI Veterans SAMHSA: Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Behavioral Health Equity Resources for AANHPI people include national survey reports, agency and federal initiatives, related behavioral health resources, and in-language resources. Asian Mental Health Collective The Asian Mental Health Collective’s (AMHC’s) mission is to normalize and de-stigmatize mental health within the Asian community. AMHC aspires to make mental health easily available, approachable, and accessible to Asian communities worldwide. Japanese American Veterans’ Association The Japanese American Veterans' Association, Inc. (JAVA), is a fraternal and educational organization with many purposes. JAVA preserves and strengthens comradeship among its members; perpetuates the memory and history of our departed comrades; educates the American public on the Japanese American experience during WWII; and strives to obtain for veterans the full benefit of their entitlements as veterans. Sikh American Veterans Alliance The Sikh American Veterans Alliance (SAVA) seeks to mobilize community members and policymakers to promote the core values of loyalty, unity, and selfless service intrinsic to both Sikhism and military service; fight religious extremism and intolerance; and strengthen the military by promoting inclusion and fostering a diverse force. SAVA works to strengthen our military while supporting a larger American community of civil rights and religious freedom advocates. Black Veterans Black people have served in the U.S. military in every battle that has taken place. According to the National WWII Museum, more than one million African American men and women served during WWII. Of those who served were the Tuskegee Airmen. Before them, no African American had ever been a United States military pilot. The Jim Crow laws, a series of racist laws that enforced the “separate but equal” treatment of African Americans, were used as justification for blocking previous attempts by African American soldiers to become pilots (National WWII Museum (PDF | 145 KB)). It is important to acknowledge that although formal means of discrimination may no longer be in practice, the military, like many other large institutions, does not find itself isolated when it comes to dealing with ongoing racial and behavioral health disparities. According to VA’s Office of Health Equity, from 2019 to 2045, the racial and ethnic makeup of veterans will change, and Black veterans will comprise 15 percent of the veteran population (currently making up 12 percent of the population). According to the 2023 National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report (PDF | 2 MB), in 2021 the suicide rate for Black or African American veterans was 17.4 per 100,000. Unique Challenges Although help-seeking behavior is improving, many Black people still do not seek treatment for behavioral health due not only to stigma, but also due to a perceived lack of trust in the mental health system. Additionally, some Black people tend to rely on the strength of extended family, close friends, and the role of their community and faith-based organizations for support. Resources for Black Veterans SAMHSA: Black/African American Behavioral Health Equity Resources on this population include national survey reports, agency and federal initiatives, and related behavioral health resources. African American Behavioral Health Center of Excellence The African American Behavioral Health Center of Excellence (AABH-COE) is funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, SAMHSA. AABH-COE’s mission is to help transform behavioral health services for African Americans, making them safer, more effective, more accessible, more inclusive, more welcoming, more engaging, and more culturally appropriate and responsive. Black Veterans Project The mission of the Black Veterans Project is to (1) acknowledge and amplify the unique achievements and contributions of Black veterans and to (2) lead a movement for racial inclusion and justice across the five branches of the U.S. military while ensuring the welfare of all black veterans who served. Black Veterans for Social Justice The mission of Black Veterans for Social Justice is to provide program services to assist military personnel with making a smooth transition from active duty to civilian life. Services are provided to SMVF in the areas of social readjustment, housing, employment, compensation, disability, substance abuse, medical treatment, post-traumatic stress syndrome, legal advocacy, discharge up-grade, and redress of grievances within and outside the military. Hispanic and Latino Veterans Members of the Hispanic and Latino communities have been a consistent force in the United States Military going back to the Revolutionary War with 59 individuals receiving the Medal of Honor. According to the 2022 Demographics: Profile of the Military Community, 18.4% of all active duty members identify as Hispanic or Latino, with the number being similar in the selected reserves with 15.4% self-identifying. According to VA’s Office of Health Equity (OHE), from 2019 to 2045, the population of Hispanic veterans will increase from 8 percent to 12 percent. Much like Black veterans, the incidence of racial inequities in the military for Hispanic or Latino veterans is alarming. For example, according to VA’s 2023 National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report (PDF | 2 MB), from 2020 to 2021 there was a .5% increase in suicide rates for Hispanic veterans. Unique Challenges It is believed that members of the Hispanic population are grossly underserved by mental health programming. At the forefront of this may be race and ethnicity-based differences, including language, cultural norms regarding mental health-seeking behavior, and lack of provider diversity, among other barriers. Hispanic/Latino Veterans are often at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes (PDF | 795 KB). According to the Center for American Progress, Even when we control for factors like hazardous combat experience, Hispanic veterans have higher rates and severity of post-traumatic stress disorder than their white or African American counterparts. Resources for Hispanic and Latino Veterans SAMHSA: Hispanic/Latino Behavioral Health Equity This page provides resources for Hispanic and Latino people, including national survey reports, agency and federal initiatives, and related behavioral health and Spanish-language resources. American Latino Veterans Association The American Latino Veterans Association is a registered 501c3 that exists to help American Latino veterans thrive after their military service, access the benefits they have earned, and enhance recognition of Latino contributions to our nation’s defense since before its inception.

Their mission is to advance the inclusion of Latinos across all leadership levels in the U.S. Armed Forces, military and civilian. League of United Latin American Citizens Veterans The League of United Latin American Citizens is the nation’s oldest and largest Latino civil rights volunteer-based organization that empowers Hispanic Americans and builds strong Latino communities. This organization honors and empowers veterans. The website includes veteran visa resources. National Latino Behavioral Health Association The National Latino Behavioral Health Association was established to fill a need for a unified national voice for Latino populations in the behavioral health arena and to bring attention to the great disparities that exist in areas of access, utilization, practice-based research, and adequately trained personnel. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer + (LGBTQ+) Veterans Despite being repealed in 2011, the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell (DADT)” law forced LGBTQ+ service members to hide their sexual orientation or face discharge. This policy impacted the mental health and career advancement of many LGBTQ+ service members, and many of those service members were discharged under less-than-honorable conditions, which continues to affect their access to veterans’ benefits (DOD to Upgrade Discharges From 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' Policy). For Transgender Veterans there has been a lot of back and forth recently as to whether they should be allowed to serve (From Handcuffs to Rainbows: Queer in the Military). In 2023 the Military Readiness Act of 2023 largely banned transgender people with some exceptions; this is the current law in place (H.R. 1064). In 2024 President Biden put out a proclamation that granted pardon to certain violations of Article 125 under the UCMJ (PDF | 19 KB) (Uniform Code of Military Justice). This pardon was specific to consensual relations of individual 18 or more, whose relationships were not permitted in the UCMJ. Unique Challenges According to SAMHSA’s “Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Behavioral Health: Results from the 2021 and 2022 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health,” some challenges LGB individuals might face include the following: The prevalence of SMI (Serious Mental Illness) in the past year was more than 3 times higher among bisexual males than among straight males and more than twice as high among gay males than among straight males. Bisexual males also were more likely than gay males to have had SMI. - Sexual minority females were more likely than straight females to have had serious thoughts of suicide in the past year. Bisexual females also were more likely than lesbian females to have had serious thoughts of suicide; more than 1 in 7 bisexual females had serious thoughts of suicide - Bisexual males and gay males were more likely than straight males to have had serious thoughts of suicide in the past year (about 3 times as likely for bisexual males and more than twice as likely for gay males). However, the prevalence of serious thoughts of suicide in the past year did not differ for bisexual males or gay males. - A study from Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law in which they assessed data from the U.S. Transgender Population Health Survey found that 81% of transgender adults in the U.S. have thought about suicide, 42% of transgender adults have attempted it, and 56% have engaged in non-suicidal self-injury over their lifetimes. Resources for LGBTQ+ Veterans SAMHSA: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex (LGBTQI+) Behavioral Health Equity This page provides resources for the LGBTQ+ population, including national survey reports, agency and federal initiatives, and related behavioral health resources. Disabled American Veterans: LGBTQ+ Veterans Disabled American Veterans is dedicated to a single purpose: empowering veterans to lead high-quality lives with respect and dignity. They accomplish this by ensuring that veterans and their families can access the full range of benefits available to them; fighting for the interests of America’s injured heroes on Capitol Hill; and educating the public about the great sacrifices and needs of veterans transitioning back to civilian life. The Center of Excellence on LGBTQ+ Behavioral Health Equity The Center of Excellence on LGBTQ+ Behavioral Health Equity provides behavioral health practitioners with vital information on supporting people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex, two-spirit, and other diverse sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions. Military Sexual Assault in Transgender Veterans: Results from a Nationwide Survey This 2018 VA study used an online national survey of 221 transgender veterans to identify the prevalence of military sexual assault and to assess its association with demographic characteristics, past history of sexual victimization, and stigma-related factors. Modern Military Association of America Formed through the merger of the American Military Partner Association and OutServe-SLDN, the Modern Military Association of America is the nation’s largest non-profit organization dedicated to advancing fairness and equality for the LGBTQ military and veteran community. Through education, advocacy and support, the organization works to make a difference in the lives of LGBTQ+ SMVF. Trans Lifeline: Resources for Military and Veterans The Trans Lifeline has assembled a number of resources to assist transgender service members and veterans. Transgender Veterans’ Satisfaction with Care and Unmet Health Needs This 2020 VA study examined transgender veterans’ satisfaction with VA medical and mental health care, prevalence of delaying care, and correlates of these outcomes. VHA LGBTQ+ Health Program VA has health care services available that are specific to LGBTQ+ veterans. This website provides links to those resources and information for each LGBTQ+ Veteran Care Coordinator. There is an LGBTQ+ Veteran Care Coordinator at every facility to help LGBTQ+ veterans access needed care. Older Veterans According to the 2023 American Community Survey Report titled, “Aging Veterans: America’s Veteran Population in Later Life (PDF | 492 KB),” of the country’s 16.5 million living veterans, 8.1 million (or nearly 50 percent) are 65 years or older. The largest group of older veterans are male in the age group of 72–74 years old. In 1964, when the United States entered the Vietnam War, those in service were 18–20 years old and made up the core age group of draftees and enlistees. These older veterans have served in conflicts around the world, including World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and even in the Persian Gulf War (Veteran Affairs: Elderly Veterans). Unique Challenges According to the National Council on Aging, older veterans are in worse health than civilians in the same age group. In addition, while older veterans have higher incomes, they have less of a financial safety net in terms of savings and home equity. Eighty-one percent of older veterans have at least two chronic conditions, such as hypertension, arthritis, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer, compared with 70 percent of older civilians. Twenty-five percent of older veterans may have at least one functional limitation, such as trouble bathing, dressing, and walking, as compared to 17 percent of their civilian counterparts. Older veterans have somewhat higher rates of mental health issues. Twenty-two percent of older veterans report feelings of depression, as compared to 18 percent among their civilian counterparts. Additionally, the Future of Personal Health reports older veterans are more likely to have a limitation in activities of daily living and an increased level of dependence over time. Over 50% of older veterans report difficulty in functioning and rate their health status as fair or poor. Additionally, older African American and Hispanic veterans report worse health than non-Hispanic white veterans across most health indicators. Resources for Older Veterans SAMHSA: Resources for Older Adults SAMHSA has several products for serving older adults with mental and substance use disorders that can be useful to clinicians, other service providers, older adults, and caregivers. AARP: Veterans, Active Duty, and Military Families AARP is well known for their support of the older community. This page is specific to SMVF and provides information and resources, including programs available from agencies such as VA, the U.S. Department of Defense, Medicare, and Medicaid. Eldercare Locator A public service of the U.S. Administration on Aging provides a service locator for older adults. Some of the local resources provided include area agencies on aging, state agencies on aging, elder abuse prevention, department of social services protective serves for adults, health insurance counseling, legal services, and more. Resources vary by location. Elizabeth Dole Foundation The Elizabeth Dole Foundation’s programs provide military and veteran caregivers the support they need at the local, state, and national levels. These programs engage individuals, organizations, and communities across the country to get involved and make a difference in the lives of military caregivers. Operation Family Caregiver: Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregivers Operation Family Caregiver is a program of the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregivers (RCI). RCI supports caregivers—both family and professional—through advocacy, education, research, and service. It establishes local, state, national, and international partnerships committed to building quality, long-term home and community-based services. VA Caregiver Support Program VA has resources and benefits for caregivers in the SMVF community, including the VA’s Caregiver Support line, in-home support services, and much more. Rural and Agricultural Veterans According to VA’s Office of Rural Health, almost 25 percent of veterans in the United States returned from active duty to rural communities. That equates to about 4.4 million veterans in rural communities. There are a number of reasons why veterans choose to live in rural communities, such as closer proximity to family, friends and community; open space for recreation; more privacy; lower cost of living; or less crowded towns and schools. While there are many benefits to living in rural communities, there are also some challenges. Unique Challenges Rural veterans and their families, like other rural residents, often face difficulties in accessing health care and other services. Some of those challenges are fewer physician practices as well as hospitals and other health delivery resources, greater geographic distance barriers, limited broadband internet, and compared to urban areas, a larger population of older residents. In rural areas there are fewer housing, education, employment, and transportation options. All of these challenges create barriers for rural veterans and caregivers in receiving the health care and other services they need. Resources for Rural and Agricultural Veterans Farmer Veteran Coalition Farmer Veteran Coalition cultivates a new generation of farmers and food leaders and develops viable employment and meaningful careers through the collaboration of the farming and military communities. Reaching Rural Veterans | The Military Family Research Institute at Purdue University Reaching rural veterans is a collaboration with faith-based food pantries in rural areas, bringing communities together to provide resources and services that address the needs of military and veteran families. The Rural Veteran Outreach Toolkit Using the Rural Veteran Outreach Toolkit can increase partnerships between VA and rural communities and enhance VA’s ultimate goal of "improving the quality of life for veterans who live in rural communities." USDA Supports America’s Heroes USDA’s veterans website serves as a one-stop navigator for veterans looking to learn more about employment, education, and entrepreneurship on or beyond the farm. Veterans to Farmers Veterans to Farmers helps assist veterans to assimilate effectively, productively, and permanently into private citizenry through agricultural training and education. Veteran classmates work alongside each other, learning new skills and experiencing the grounding effects of the farm. Veterans Health Administration’s Office of Rural Health Congress established the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of Rural Health (ORH) in 2006 (38 USC § 7308) to conduct, coordinate, promote and disseminate research on issues that affect the nearly five million veterans who reside in rural communities. Women Veterans Women have been serving in the military in one form or another for more than 200 years (USO). According to the 2020 Report of the Department of Veterans Affairs Advisory Committee on Women Veterans (PDF | 6 MB), approximately two million women veterans have served in the Armed Forces. This number will continue to grow due to the increased presence of women in the active duty and reserve components. More than 300,000 women have served in Iraq and Afghanistan since 9/11 and more than 9,000 have earned Combat Action Badges. Over the past 7 years, over 100 women have graduated from Army Ranger School and others have completed Navy Seal Officer’s selection and assessment. According to VA’s 2023 National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report (PDF | 2 MB), the increase in veteran suicides seen in 2021, compared to 2020, was particularly seen in women veterans, for whom there was a 24.1% increase in the age-adjusted suicide rate, compared to an increase of 6.3% among male veterans. Today, women make up 16 percent of our nation’s Armed Forces, serving in every branch of the U.S. military (USO). As this population grows and continues to serve in critical roles, it is important that we ensure we are inclusive of women veterans. Unique Challenges Each year the Department of Veterans Affairs publishes an annual report (The Department of Veterans Affairs Advisory Committee on Women Veterans 2022 (PDF | 2.7 MB)) to help policymakers better support women veterans. The Wounded Warrior Project (WWP), also produces the Annual Warrior Survey. The data contained within the survey allows WWP to track and treat warriors’ most pressing needs. They share this data to inform the efforts of those who share and support their mission and to urge those with the power to make a difference. The VAs annual report and WWPs annual survey paint a comprehensive picture of the current environment that women must navigate when they leave military service, including the continued disparities between men and women veterans. WWP focused on five key areas of focus for women veterans that was outlined in the September 2023 press release, “New Report Highlights Unique Challenges Female Veterans Face After Service:” Access to care - Financial wellness - Mental health - Military transition - Social health - Resources for Women Veterans Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services The Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services is one of the oldest federal advisory committees within the U.S. Department of Defense. The Committee is composed of civilian women and men appointed by the Secretary of Defense to provide advice and recommendations on matters and policies relating to the recruitment, retention, employment, integration, well-being, and treatment of service women in the Armed Forces. Women Veterans Network The Women Veterans Network mission is to provide a unique social network of women veterans to foster connections and build relationships in local communities and across the nation. WomenVetsUSA WomenVetsUSA provides a wealth of services and connections to resources for women veterans, such as education, employment, finances, healthcare, legal, and other resources.

Addressing Diversity in PTSD Treatment: Disparities in Treatment Engagement and Outcome among Patients of Color (PDF | 269 KB) This 2020 study examines racial disparities in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment. PTSD is a prevalent mental disorder characterized by difficulty recovering from exposure to a traumatic event. The prevalence of PTSD varies by race/ethnicity, with studies in U.S. samples indicating higher prevalence and lower treatment use among some racial and ethnic minority groups compared with white people. The Behavioral Health of Minority Active Duty Service Members This RAND study examines whether minority-group service members are more likely to experience mental health and substance use problems relative to their majority counterparts in the military. The study also investigates whether minority–majority group differences in behavioral health in the military are similar to or different from those in the civilian population.

> FAQs for Assisting LGBTQ+ Individuals with SSI/SSDI Applications This document provides answers to frequently asked questions about working with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex, two-spirit, and other diverse sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions (LGBTQ+) applicants during the Supplemental Security Income/Social Security Disability Insurance (SSI/SSDI) application process. Learn more about using respectful language, engaging in productive and meaningful ways, and preparing SSA forms and the SOAR Medical Summary Report (MSR) with special care and attention to details around LGBTQ+ matters. Assisting LGBTQ+ SSI/SSDI Applicants Language and Engagement How can I learn more about using respectful language with LGBTQ+ communities? Answer: The SAMHSA-funded Center of Excellence for LGBTQ+ Behavioral Health Equity has created an excellent and easy-to-use language guide covering sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression (SOGIE). It offers information about outdated and updated language and why language matters. The Center also has a six-minute animation that describes what LGBTQ+ and SOGIE mean. What are pronouns and why are they important? Answer: Pronouns are parts of speech that we use to refer to individuals when we are talking about them in the third person. An example of this is the word “she” in the sentence, “she bought me lunch today.” People often make assumptions about what pronouns to use for someone based on their name or their appearance. When someone identifies as non-binary or a gender that does not match the stereotypical appearance of their gender, these assumptions and the misgendering that results from using the wrong pronouns can be harmful. Pronouns.org has helpful information about personal pronouns and why knowing and using someone’s accurate pronouns is important. What do I do if I don’t know someone’s pronouns? Answer: Ask! It may be helpful to include your pronouns as general practice when introducing yourself, as this allows others the space to share their pronouns. For example, “My name is Mike and I use he and him pronouns. I see the paperwork here says your name is Sarah. Is that how I should refer to you?” What happens if I misgender someone? How can I make amends? Answer: Recognize, apologize, correct, and move forward. Do not go on about how hard it is; those are our own anxious feelings. It takes practice! The more that we use the correct pronouns with someone and when referring to someone, the easier it will get. We can make it more fluid for ourselves by bringing awareness to our language and practicing! What is a deadname? Answer: A deadname is a name that a person no longer uses. Many transgender or non-binary people change their name from their given or birth name to feel more affirmed in their true gender. It is important to use a person’s correct name and pronouns when communicating with or about them. There may be situations in the Social Security disability application process where you need to reference the person’s deadname to explain why there are discrepancies in medical records prior to their name change. You can address this difference in the remarks section on SSA forms, and in the introduction to your Medical Summary Report. Social Security Administration (SSA) Forms What gender do I put on the SSA forms when someone is transgender or non-binary? Answer: You should use the gender that the individual requests. In the Remarks section, you can explain that the person is transgender and when they changed their name or gender markers, and if applicable, with their correct name. If they have a deadname (described above), you can explain that some older records may reference that name. If you have date ranges for which the prior gender and name were used and discontinued, include this information in the remarks section as well. Can individuals change their gender (sex) in their records with Social Security? Answer: Yes! As of October 19, 2022, individuals can self-select their sex on their Social Security number (SSN) record. To make an update, they will need to apply for a replacement SSN card. They will still need to show a current document to prove their identity, but they will not need to provide medical or legal documentation of their sex designation. Additionally, documentation that reflects an “X” gender marker is acceptable identifying documentation. If a person changes their name, it is also important to report the name change to SSA as soon as possible, so their earnings get recorded properly in their SSA record. This will ensure that the person receives all the benefits they are due if they become disabled and unable to work. I am working with an applicant who is transgender and currently in the process of changing their name. What do we do if their name change is finalized during the application process? Answer: SSA recommends that the applicant ask their SSA field office to make a special note of this for the Disability Determination Services (DDS) and, once the application has gone to DDS, to touch base with the disability examiner to remind them. As the SOAR case worker, you can indicate that a name change is in process in the Remarks Section of all SSA forms, as well as in the Medical Summary Report. You could also include the name change document with the completed SOAR application. By keeping up good communication with DDS, the examiner will know that the applicant’s name and gender may not match all medical documentation. SSA also suggested informing the applicant's medical sources to ensure they are aware for medical records purposes. Here are some helpful links regarding name/gender changes: Application for a Social Security Card - RM 10212.015 Evidence Requirements to Process a Name Change on the SSN - RM 10212.200 Changing Numident Data for Reasons other than Name Change - Are same-gender partners or spouses eligible for benefits based on their partner or spouse's record? Answer: Yes! Same-gender couples and their families may be eligible for SSA benefits based on their marital status, including non-marital legal relationships like civil unions and domestic partnerships. These benefits may include retirement, survivors, Medicare, and disability benefits. SSA has helpful information about eligibility. Medical Records and Medical Summary Report How do I request medical records for an individual whose name was legally changed but whose records may be under their “deadname?” Answer: On the release of information the individual will need to include both names. They will sign the form with their current legal name but request the old records indicating the prior name used. This process would be similar to how it would be handled for a person who changes their last name upon marriage or divorce. I have medical records that have the individual’s former sex/gender and their birth name (i.e., deadname), how do I handle that in the Medical Summary Report? Answer: In the opening paragraph of your Medical Summary Report, you will explain that the individual has changed their name and identifies as their correct gender. Explain that their records from birth to their legal name change will reference their former information. State that throughout your MSR you will refer to them by their correct name and pronouns. How do we include information about the trauma they have experienced as a transgender youth? Answer: Consider how a potential applicant’s racial, ethnic, religious, and cultural backgrounds may impact their experiences. Additionally, be mindful of how your own experiences may impact your opinions/feelings/attitudes toward the person’s functioning. The interviewing process can uncover very sensitive topics such as past and current trauma, and it is important to be sensitive to the way that this can affect a person’s willingness and ability to provide information. The questions asked during this process, as well as how they are asked, can be critical to obtaining the appropriate information. The overarching questions you should ask yourself are: Does asking this information help provide insight into the applicant’s functioning? Is the question being asked in a way that conveys a sense of care and non-judgment? Unless it relates to the individual’s ability to function, avoid questions about which gender-affirming surgeries or treatment a person has received. Sample questions: Was there ever a time in the past or recently when something really bad or very upsetting happened to you? You don’t need to give me any details. Does it still impact you? - Do you feel safe or are you generally afraid? Of anyone or anything in particular? - As a child or teenager, were you ever physically, emotionally, or sexually abused? - Relevant Evidence for Inclusion Did the applicant experience trauma that can be connected to discrimination, or denial of access to medical/educational/or legal services due to discrimination or prejudice? - Does the impact of historical trauma influence the applicant’s ability to function currently? Consider the era and the location of where the applicant was raised. - Individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ are often more likely to experience episodic homelessness – meaning they’ve experienced extreme instability. Because LGBTQ+ individuals are at higher risk of abuse and harassment in sheltered and street settings, it is not uncommon for individuals to enter or remain in abusive situations to avoid other forms of abuse. - How might medical records differ for someone who identifies as transgender or nonbinary? Answer: Many people who identify outside of the gender binary experience discrimination and delayed healthcare when interacting with medical providers. Nearly half of transgender adults report negative or discriminatory experiences with a healthcare provider. This can look like higher institutionalization rates, misdiagnoses, and/or refusal to provide treatment for the individual’s stated symptoms [1]. Additionally, you may find diagnoses related to a person’s gender identity that they may or may not agree with or feel comfortable about receiving. For example, “Gender Dysphoria” is a current DSM-5 diagnosis used among physicians. This has evolved over time, and previous diagnoses may reflect the out-of-date language, such as “gender identity disorder” and/or “transsexualism.” Due to the history of discrimination, any of these diagnoses could be a source of discomfort for individuals. What should we do when someone who is LGBTQ+ doesn’t have enough medical documentation? Answer: Much like other folks who experience homelessness, you may find that individuals who have experienced discrimination or fear discrimination from medical providers based on their gender identity or sexual orientation do not have thorough medical documentation of their disabling condition(s). This is where it helps to get creative about collecting medical evidence: Creative Strategies for Tracking Down Medical Evidence: SOAR Team Tips. Don’t forget to rely on community partners! Many communities have LGBTQ+ Community Centers which frequently include small clinics or medical staff. While these typically aren’t full-service medical facilities, they can be excellent resources for updated records and co-signatures while ensuring culturally competent care for the individual. Additionally, when faced with this challenge, remember that the Medical Summary Report, especially when co-signed by an acceptable medical source, is a valuable tool for demonstrating functional impairments. How can I indicate that someone is transgender or non-binary when entering their application into the SOAR Online Application Tracking (OAT) system? Answer: OAT initially offered two options for gender (male/female). As of May 2023, OAT now includes the option to include additional gender identities in the demographics section.
