November 2023Vol. 24, No. 9Introduction to LGBTQ+ Populations With Special Considerations for the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline A free e-learning course from the Center of Excellence on LGBTQ+ Behavioral Health Equity provides learners with basic information about the LGBTQ+ community and some of the challenges they experience that could lead to a need for mental health crisis support. While developed for use by crisis and mental health counselors, such as those with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Line (formerly known as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline), this course and the important information presented therein can also benefit professionals from child welfare and many other disciplines in their work with individuals and families. The hour-long, self-paced course, “Introduction to LGBTQ+ Populations With Special Considerations for the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline,” which is available on the E-Learning Modules page of the center’s website, addresses LGBTQ+ terminology, including which terms to avoid and why; gender pronouns and associated best practices; how to speak with and about the LGBTQ+ community in an affirming and respectful way; mental health considerations; the coming out process; and more. This and other eligible e-learning sessions offer 1.0 free continuing education credit (accredited by the Council on Social Work Education) or a noncredit certificate of attendance upon successful completion of the online training module, pre/posttest, and evaluation. To view session recordings or join future live webinars, sign up for a free account on the center’s website.
