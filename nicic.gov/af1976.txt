After the amazing feedback I (the author, Mei Ke) received on my original post “How to make an LGBTQ+ friendly survey,” I (the author, Mei Ke) realized that my critiques on a badly written questionnaire did not provide the full context of what an inclusive LGBTQ+ survey would look like. After further experience in diversity and data work, I (the author, Mei Ke) would make some changes and recommendations to create a fully functional survey template that is LGBTQ+ friendly. These recommendations come from my own experience as a queer and transgender person in the LGBTQ+ community, as well as from sources like GLADD’s Media Reference Guide.
