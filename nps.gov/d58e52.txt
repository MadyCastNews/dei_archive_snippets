Providing free education tools and materials for teachers, interpreters, students, and lifelong learners inside and outside the National Park Service is one important way we support the agency's mission. The value of America's cultures and diverse heritages may be lost if it's not passed on to the next generation or experienced by the present one. Want to inspire young people to grow into responsible citizens? Looking for more resources to craft interpretation or educational programming plans? See the related resources below or visit our Education & Training page for more. As an educator, you can incorporate LGBTQ history and heritage into lesson plans. The National Park Service has tools available for all grade levels through the Teaching with Historic Places program. More information, examples, and inspiration are available via the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) and Quist. Information on teaching and thinking about diverse history is also available via the National Park Service's Heritage Initiatives "Teaching Cultural Heritage Preservation." Last updated: May 20, 2021
