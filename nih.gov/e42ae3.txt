Pride Month: Embracing Your Career Journey and Your Authentic Self June is Pride Month, a time dedicated to celebrating the LGBTQ+ community, honoring its history, and recognizing the progress made towards equality. It’s also an opportunity for LGBTQ+ professionals and allies to reflect on their careers and find ways to thrive in their professional lives. Finding Value Alignment at Work One of the most empowering things you can do as an LGBTQ+ professional is to embrace your authentic self. This means bringing your true identity to the workplace, which can significantly enhance your job satisfaction and overall well-being. Companies are increasingly recognizing the value of diversity and inclusion, with many implementing policies to support LGBTQ+ employees. It is important as a job seeker to also seek out organizations that have values that align with your own. Websites like Out & Equal’s Workplace Equality Fact Sheets, Glassdoor’s Diversity & Inclusion page, and LinkedIn’s LGBTQ+ network can provide job search tips, company reviews, and insights into companies’ diversity policies. Check organizational charts for diversity, review non-discrimination or diversity statements from the company, and talk to current or former employees to get a sense of overall culture. An important reminder from Colorado State’s Pride Resource Center: You have agency to make decisions that affirm who you are, protect your boundaries and privacy, and contribute to your sense of safety. The two options of simply being out or being closeted is a false narrative - we make decisions every day for how we navigate living as our authentic selves and our right to privacy based on context, cues, safety, and our energy. Sometimes we want the world to know we’re proud to be queer/trans, and sometimes we don’t want to have to explain ourselves to others. There is fluidity in your decisions and you have the agency to decide what you need – including in employment. Building a Support Network Having a robust support network is crucial for career success. This includes mentors, colleagues, and friends who can offer guidance, advice, and support. Here are some ways to build and strengthen your network: Join LGBTQ+ Professional Organizations: There are numerous organizations dedicated to supporting LGBTQ+ professionals across various industries. Organizations like Out & Equal, The National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC), and Pride at Work provide networking opportunities, resources, and advocacy for LGBTQ+ employees. - Connect with the NIH affinity group LGBT – Fellows and Friends which strives to enhance the environment for LGBTQIA+ scientists at the NIH. - Pride Month is a celebration of identity, courage, and progress. It’s also a reminder of the importance of creating inclusive and supportive environments in all areas of life, including the workplace. By embracing your authentic self, finding value alignment, and building a strong support network, you can not only advance your career but also contribute to a more equitable world. Happy Pride!
