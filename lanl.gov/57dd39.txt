Los Alamos National Laboratoryâs lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer, and questioning (LGBTQ+) employees and their supporters created the Labâs first Post-It note window art installation on June 6. In a visible display promoting diversity, hundreds of people jotted words of support on Post-Its. Six windows of the Labâs centrally located Otowi building third-floor breezeway were transformed into the six vibrant stripes of the iconic gay pride rainbow flag. ââBe the danceâ is my favorite of the Post With Pride messages,â said Michael Davis with the Labâs LGBTQ+ Employee Resource Group. Other notes included: Love is love. - Diversity makes the world go âround. - Inclusion and engagement make a better LANL. - Proud to work for a supportive employer. - We support you. #LANLPride - âDiversity is a critical part of building a best place to workâone of the Labâs strategic goals,â said Diversity Officer C.J. Bacino. âWe wanted to create an activity that shows LANL is a welcoming, inclusive, engaging place for everybody.â The event was documented in a stop-motion video to be shared on social media to assist with new employee recruitment. âPart of the purpose of this event is to share our work culture in a visible and interactive way,â said Amy Chacon with the Office of Diversity and Strategic Staffing.
