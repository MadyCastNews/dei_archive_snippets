Impact Justice and the National Center for Lesbian Rights have released "Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Questioning, and/or Gender Nonconforming and Transgender Girls and Boys in the California Juvenile Justice System: A Practice Guide." This guide is designed to help California probation officials protect the safety and well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual, questioning, and/or gender nonconforming and transgender (LGBQ/GNCT) youth in their care and custody. The guide recommends policies and procedures to prohibit discrimination, prevent harm, and promote fair and equitable treatment of LGBQ/GNCT youth in the state's juvenile justice system.
