April 2014Vol. 15, No. 4Resources for Working With LGBTQ Youth The American Bar Association's (ABA's) Center on Children and the Law, a full-service training, technical assistance, and research program that addresses a wide variety of law- and court-related topics affecting the welfare of children, works on a number of projects aimed at improving outcomes for youth involved with child welfare. One such project is focused specifically on supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) young people in foster care. The Opening Doors project provides tools and resources to professionals in the legal and child welfare communities to support their work in improving outcomes for this high-risk population. The project website links to a variety of trainings, publications, and other information, including the companion It's Your Life interactive website (and publication with the same name) for LGBTQ youth. The website was created to help LGBTQ youth in foster care navigate the child welfare system and understand their rights. It also provides a Where to Get Help section for LGBTQ youth that may be in crisis or otherwise in need of assistance with issues pertaining to harassment, violence, discrimination, homelessness, education, health, and sexuality. Additionally, the project website provides a section of issue-specific legal updates and connects individuals with other pertinent ABA and non-ABA projects and related groups.
