> Coast Guard Spectrum - Living Our Truth Happy Pride Month! LGBTQ+ pride month is celebrated each year in June to honor the 1969 Stonewall uprising in Manhattan, a critical tipping point in LGBTQ+ rights in America. This June, the Coast Guard commemorates Pride Month with the theme, “Living Our Truth”, celebrating the diverse spectrum of identities within the LGBTQ+ community and acknowledging the ongoing work needed to secure the liberty entitled to every American. Coast Guard Spectrum Chapters across the country are hosting events throughout the month to celebrate! Who is Coast Guard Spectrum? Established in 2019, Coast Guard Spectrum is a multicultural LGBTQ+ affinity group and an official affiliate of the US Coast Guard. From Spectrum’s mission statement: “Coast Guard Spectrum aims to create a welcoming, supportive, and affirming community centered on Coast Guard Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning, Intersex, Asexual, Pansexual, and Queer employees, Auxiliarists, families, veterans, and allies.” Spectrum is currently composed of 13 chapters nationwide, working to create welcoming and affirming workplaces where all people can thrive as their authentic selves. Spectrum Organization Spectrum is led by a National Operations Committee (NOC), supplemented by senior advisors and its founding members. Below, we highlight one member from each of the branches who represent the diversity and commitment within our affinity group. Lt. Cmdr. Angel Kwok (she/her), International Port Security Liaison Officer, Activities Europe, Netherlands. While her daytime duties include traveling throughout the world to improve our global maritime system, Lt. Cmdr. Kwok champions multiple efforts to increase visibility of the LGBTQ+ challenges and improving diversity and inclusion within our service. Capt. Trey Wirth (he/him), Chief, Office of Marine Environmental Response Policy, US Coast Guard Headquarters, Washington D.C. Capt. Wirth serves as the Senior Advisor to CG Spectrum and works closely with Coast Guard leadership to influence policy changes. He has made significant impacts regarding transgender policy for active duty and Auxiliary, in addition to identifying gaps in recruitment. Dr. Alexander Waid (he/him), Department of Humanities, U.S. Coast Guard Academy, New London, Connecticut. Dr. Waid is one of the founding members of CG Spectrum and continues to play a vital role in creating an inclusive environment for our organization. This is especially important at our accession points such as the CG Academy. Last year, Dr. Waid spoke at the Atlantic Area Pride celebration and currently serves as the co-advisor to CGA Spectrum. What is Spectrum working on? CG Spectrum has seen rapid growth since its founding in 2019. This month, we will be cutting the ribbon for two new chapters in Juneau, Alaska, and Washington D.C., bringing our total count to 15 chapters nationwide! These chapters are active year-round and aim to provide training, support, and mentorship for the Coast Guard’s LGBTQ+ community and allies. The chapters are especially busy during June in observance of Pride Month. Many chapters participate in their local Pride celebrations and parades, and host a myriad of events including educational socials that encourage learning and discussion of LGBTQ+ challenges. Why is inclusion important? Respect is one of the Coast Guard’s core values, and we cannot uphold this value without respecting our LGBTQ+ shipmates. All of our shipmates deserve to feel like they belong in the Coast Guard family, and every one of us plays a vital role in upholding a strong service culture where every person can live their truth. How to be an ally CG Spectrum welcomes allies, and we would love your participation in our local chapters! Being an ally does not have to include grand gestures, in fact, subtle actions are often the most valued. Something as small as including your pronouns in your email signature communicates that you are respectful of individuals with diverse gender identities and committed to an inclusive work environment. Together, we can help all our shipmates feel accepted and included in a more welcoming Coast Guard family.

> Commandant: Celebrate Pride Month by “living your truth” This June the Coast Guard commemorates Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and others (LGBTQ+) Pride Month with the theme, “Living Our Truth”, which celebrates the diverse spectrum of identities within the LGBTQ+ community and acknowledges the ongoing work to secure the liberty entitled to every American. For much of our Nation’s history LGBTQ+ people were disenfranchised and forced to hide the truth of their gender or sexual orientation, or risk discrimination, hate, and violence. “Pride”, the slogan for the march held in New York City on the first anniversary of Stonewall Uprising, became the rallying cry for members of the LGBTQ+ community to publicly express their personal dignity, a pivotal sea change that helped launch the gay rights movement. Members of the LGBTQ+ community have served and continue to serve with distinction at all levels in government. The past service of LGBTQ+ people in the U.S. military is often unknown to history due to the laws that forced them to either hide their affiliations or be discharged. Today’s members and recruits know they will not face that past level of discrimination as they serve the Nation. LGBTQ+ people are critical members of our Coast Guard workforce and today we can celebrate their contributions to missions past and present. Every one of us plays a vital role in upholding a strong service culture where every person can serve in workplaces free from discrimination and harassment and perform their duty to the best of their ability. We can show support for our LGBTQ+ colleagues by educating ourselves, strengthening service culture, reaffirming our commitment to inclusion, and by using the resources available at the following pages: https://www.history.com/news/stonewall-riots-facts-gay-rights-lgbt https://www.deomi.mil/Special-Observances/#pride-month -USCG-

> “Living Our Truth” and Authenticity Define Coast Guard’s Pride Month Event Coast Guard Headquarters observed LGBTQ+ Pride Month with a keynote address delivered by Raffi Freedman-Gurspan, Deputy Director of Public Engagement at the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), on June 25, 2024. Freedman-Gurspan, who was adopted from Honduras and raised in Brookline, Massachusetts, shared her perspectives on identity, belonging, and reflected on her journey into LGBTQ+ and gender equality activism. Her early involvement with LGBTQ+ rights and gender equality started in college and continued after graduation, when she joined the Massachusetts Transgender Political Coalition (MTPC). After several legislative roles in the state of Massachusetts, the Obama Administration hired her as Outreach and Recruitment Director in the Presidential Personnel Office, which led her to become the first openly transgender person to work as a White House staffer. In embracing the 2024 Department of Homeland Security Pride Month theme, “Living our Truth,” Freedman-Gurspan effectively encapsulated the profound significance of individuals serving openly and authentically in public service roles. She said: "All we’ve ever been asking for is the opportunity to be ourselves, to be our full authentic selves, and from a federal service standpoint, it is good business to have supportive work environments where people can be their best, and where they can just do the job the American people have entrusted them with." Freedman-Gurspan also emphasized the intertwined histories of LGBTQ+ rights and American history, celebrating the progress made and acknowledging the contributions of past and modern LGBTQ+ pioneers. When asked where she draws inspiration from, Freedman-Gurspan noted the courage and resilience of today's youth, who have grown up in a world shaped by LGBTQ+ victories thanks to those pioneers. Freedman-Gurspan explained: “They have tasted the fruits of the labor of people like Sylvia Rivera, Marsha P. Johnson, and Harvey Milk...They have experienced so much profound change, and I’ve seen it. That’s what gives me the most inspiration—the drive, the courage, and the simplicity of a message that our people are asking for: to just be themselves, to have the opportunity to make it in this country, to serve their country, and to serve their community.” Raffi Freedman-Gurspan gets ready to cut the ceremonial ribbon signifying the establishment of the Coast Guard Spectrum National Capital Region Chapter June 25th, 2024. (USCG Photo by Patrick Ferraris) Her journey from activist to public servant exemplifies the power of visibility and the importance of advocating for inclusive policies that reflect the diversity of the American people. She elaborated: “What I can say is that the progress that I have seen during my own lifetime has led me to this very place where I am, where I can be a public servant…and I am reminded from my student activism days about the important power of raising one’s hand and saying I’m here and I exist and I want to be part of the change.” After her remarks, Freedman-Gurspan cut the ribbon in a historic ceremony that marked the establishment of the Coast Guard Spectrum National Capital Region Chapter. The NCR chapter joins a network of local spectrum chapters with over 570 members across the Coast Guard. CG Spectrum is an anti-racist, multicultural group for who are part of or support the LGBTQ+ community within the Coast Guard. All chapters aim to create a welcoming, supportive, and affirming workplaces where all people can thrive as their authentic selves.
