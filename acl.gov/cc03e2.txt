Wednesday, November 29, 2023 | 2:30 PM ET Register for the webinar Join SAGE, one of the ACL-funded national Minority Aging Technical Assistance and Resource Centers, for their webinar, “Planning for Lifelong Care for Transgender & Non-binary People.” Many transgender people have not completed advance directives, but these documents may help lessen fears about dementia, loss of decision-making capacity, and discrimination in long-term care. Additionally, emerging research shows that transgender people of color may be at heightened risk for dementia. During this webinar, you will learn about a new decision-making tool with guiding questions that any gender-diverse person can use to identify their values and goals concerning dementia, gender identity, and gender expression, which can then be used in an advance directive. Closed captioning will be available. Contact Swayland@sageusa.org with any questions. Funded by ACL, the National Resource Center on LGBTQ+ Aging is focused on improving the quality of services and supports offered to older adults, their families, and caregivers by providing training, technical assistance, and educational resources to aging providers, LGBTQ+ organizations, and LGBTQ+ older adults.
