The factsheet, Supporting LGBTQ+ Youth: A Guide for Foster Parents, describes the unique challenges this at-risk population of youth face and how foster parents can help reduce those risks and ensure youth feel safe and supported. This factsheet was developed to help families understand the complex experiences of LGBTQ+ youth in foster care and the importance of and how to provide a nurturing and affirming home environment.
