NCJ Number 234308 Date Published March 2010 Length 25 pages Annotation This joint policy report of the National Center for Victims of Crime (National Center) and the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NACAVP) uses results of two related surveys in order to identify and raise awareness about the gaps in victims' rights and services for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) victims of crime. Abstract The survey findings show that in 2009 LGBTQ victims of crime still did not have consistent access to culturally competent services designed to prevent and address the violence perpetrated against them. Frequently, mainstream victim assistance agencies cannot meet the needs of LGBTQ crime victims in culturally sensitive ways; and LGBTQ-specific anti-violence programs either lack the resources for effective implementation or do not exist at all. Given these findings, this report offers four recommendations. First, build collaboration among LGBTQ anti-violence programs and mainstream victim assistance providers in order to increase the availability of culturally competent services for LGBTQ victims of crime. This should include LGBTQ-specific training for criminal and civil justice system personnel and victim assistance providers. Second, evaluate the implementation of State and Federal protection for victims of crime and pursue policy and legislative changes that will ensure LGBTQ victims have equal access to protections. Third, increase public awareness of the prevalence and impact of violence against LGBTQ individuals and communities, as well as crime victims' rights and services using national and local public awareness, education, and outreach campaigns. Fourth, increase State and Federal funding for collaboration, training, outreach, services, research, and data collection on the victimization of LGBTQ individuals. 31 notes
