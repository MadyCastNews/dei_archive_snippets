“Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning (LGBTQ) youth are twice as likely as other youth to be sent to a juvenile detention facility for committing “status offenses” such as truancy or running away from home. LGBTQ youth are also overrepresented in the juvenile justice system generally, and once in the system are more likely to be the target of abuse and violence, including at the hands of other youth. LGBTQ youth may also receive overly harsh punishments due to biased decision-making or misguided attempts to keep them “safe” through the use of unnecessary isolated housing. How can systems more appropriately serve youth who commit status offenses and are LGBTQ?” This webinar will explain how your agency can do this. - Topics covered include: why LGBT youth are particularly vulnerable; - zero tolerance policies and LGBT youth; - when safety nets and support systems fail; - the need for this training; - factors leading to juvenile justice system involvement; - common experiences in locked facilities; - sexual victimization; - isolation; - classification; - lack of understanding; - recommendations from the National Standards for the Care of Youth Charged with Status Offenses and LGBTQ youth; - principles for responding to status offenses; - avoiding or limiting court involvement; recommendations for LGBTQ youth; - helping LGBTQ youth avoid court involvement for status offenses; - and responding to LGBTQ youth who may have committed status offenses.
