June 2016Vol. 17, No. 4Special Initiative: LGBTQ Pride Month June is Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and/or Questioning (LGBTQ) Pride Month. LGBTQ youth are overrepresented in foster care, making up a larger percentage of youth in care than in the general youth population. Research found that there are 13.6 percent LGBTQ-identified youth in foster care compared to 7.2 percent in the general youth population, and 5.6 percent transgender youth in foster care compared to 2.25 percent in the general youth population.1 Additionally, these youth face particular challenges in care or treatment that their peers may not. Only 13 States and Washington, DC, have laws that explicitly protect youth in foster care from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.2 Another seven States protect youth against sexual orientation discrimination only.3 Laws aren't the only places where these youth face discrimination—many may experience rejection, hurtful language, and a general lack of support from resource families and/or child welfare workers. The greater bias and discrimination they face can lead to negative outcomes, such as homelessness (56 percent), high levels of depression (six times more likely), or attempted suicide (eight times more likely).4 Parents, resources families, and child welfare professionals can help protect this vulnerable population by providing support and acceptance. Standing together with LGBTQ youth is one of the most valuable protective factors that someone can provide. There are many resources available for youth and concerned adults that provide advice, guidance, and information about mental and behavioral health, education, working with LGBTQ youth and families, and the particular risks these youth and families face.
