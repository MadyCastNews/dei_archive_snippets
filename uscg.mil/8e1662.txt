June is Pride Month. The Coast Guard celebrates the multitude of contributions, sacrifices and innovations from individuals within the LGBTQ+ community. During Pride Month and throughout the year, the Coast Guard proudly stands along side its LGBTQ+ service members and civilians. We focus on being an inclusive Coast Guard which welcomes, respects, values and empowers all people.
