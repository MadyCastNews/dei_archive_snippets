August 2012Vol. 13, No. 7New Practice Guidelines for Serving LGBTQ Youth Commissioner Bryan Samuels of the Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) endorsed a set of practice guidelines to support the safety and well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, and questioning (LGBTQ) children and youth. The practice guidelines, produced by the Child Welfare League of America and Lambda Legal, outline best practices for improving positive outcomes and ensuring the safety of LGBTQ children and youth, who are largely overrepresented in the child welfare system. Specifically, the guidelines are targeted toward working with LGBTQ youth who are at risk of or are living with HIV and involved with child welfare. Recommendations include: Adopt policies prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and HIV status - Provide services that address family rejection - Provide services to increase access to medical and mental health care for youth at risk of or living with HIV - Implement services to support transgender and gender-nonconforming youth - Recommended Practices to Promote the Safety and Well-Being of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Questioning (LGBTQ) Youth and Youth at Risk of or Living With HIV in Child Welfare Settings is available on Lambda Legal's website: http://www.lambdalegal.org/publications/recommended-practices-youth
