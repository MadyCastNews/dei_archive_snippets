June 2024Vol. 25, No. 5Free InReach Platform Matches LGBTQ+ People With Verified Supports All people deserve access to the resources and support they need to thrive. However, until recently, people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, or other gender or sexual identity (LGBTQ+) facing persecution or discrimination did not have a safe and comprehensive resource platform in reach. Now, InReach—the world's first digital resource platform that matches the LGBTQ+ community with the affirming help it needs—fills this critical information gap. InReach is a free comprehensive one-stop-shop website and mobile app created by and for the diverse LGBTQ+ community. It provides on-demand access to safe and independently verified resources spanning a wide range of service types, including medical care; mental health care; legal help; food, housing, and shelter; education and employment; community support; spiritual support; trans-focused services; transportation; and more.
