Award Information Description of original award (Fiscal Year 2022, $1,000,000) The National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges (NCJFCJ) proposes a 36-month collaborative project to provide training and technical assistance (TTA) to juvenile justice system practitioners to support the identification, promotion, and implementation of system reforms that address the needs of justice-involved LGBTQ+ and Two-Spirit youth. Collaborating with the NCJFCJ in this project are the University of Maryland School of Social Work Institute for Innovation and Implementation’s National SOGIE Center, the Coalition for Juvenile Justice, the Gault Center, and the Tribal Law and Policy Institute (herein referred to as the “collaborative”). The purpose of the project is to promote policies, programs, services, and practices that serve the needs of justice-involved LGBTQ+ and Two-Spirit youth so that the juvenile justice and child welfare systems that affect them do so in ways that produce equitable outcomes for LGBTQ+ and Two-Spirit youth, promote positive youth development, empower youth to have productive lives, and create safer and inclusive communities. The proposed project’s scope and activities will have a nationwide outreach. Through this project and its activities, NCJFCJ intends to empower LGBTQ+ and Two-Spirit youth involved in the justice system to have productive lives, and create safer and inclusive communities.
