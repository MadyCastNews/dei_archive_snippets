June 26, 2019 Diversity, visibility, inclusion top DLA Troop Support Pride Month observance PHILADELPHIA — Fifty years ago, during four hot summer days in New York City’s Greenwich Village, the Stonewall Riots sparked the LGBTQ movement that continues today. More than just a series of fights, marches, protests and arrests, the historic event planted the seeds for the movement of pride, acceptance, equality, visibility and empowerment that is still growing. Jonathan Lovitz, senior vice president of the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce, served as the keynote speaker for the LGBTQ Pride Month Observance June 20 at the Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support in Philadelphia.
