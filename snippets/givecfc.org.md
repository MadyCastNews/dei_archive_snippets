> National Center for Lesbian Rights National Center for Lesbian Rights Hi, my name is Imani Rupert-Gordon, and I'm the president of NCLR, or the National Center for Lesbian Rights. NCLR is one of the nation's leading legal advocacy groups for LGBTQ people and their families. As a nonprofit law firm, we bring cases, draft and pass legislation, and educate policymakers in the public. NCLR is a small national organization with a big footprint. We're the first national legal organization to tackle homophobia and transphobia in sports, to represent LGBTQ asylum seekers, to pass laws banning conversion therapy, and to advocate for transgender people everywhere. And now we're leading the way, taking on some of the most pressing civil rights challenges of our time, ensuring that all LGBTQ people are able to live, to belong and to contribute to their communities. We're challenging ‘Don't Say Gay’ laws, representing same-sex parents who are threatened with losing custody of their children, defending laws that protect LGBTQ youth from abusive therapists, and defending transgender kids and their parents. Some people are afforded basic human rights and some of us have had to fight for them. Civil rights and social justice has only ever happened because we fought to make it happen. Thanks for changing the world with us.
