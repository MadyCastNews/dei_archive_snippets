This webinar will take place on Tuesday, September 19 from 1:00 to 2:00 pm ET. To register, please visit the Healthy People 2030 Webinar Series Registration page. Continuing Education Credits* (CEs) are available for this webinar. During this one-hour event, ODPHP and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics will present on the webinar’s three featured objectives related to injury and violence prevention. Additionally, Healthy People 2030 Champion, Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center, will present on their efforts to address bullying and violence against LGBTQ+ populations and build resilience. The three Healthy People 2030 objectives to be featured during the webinar include: - LGBT-05: Reduce bullying of lesbian, gay, or bisexual high school students High school students who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual are almost twice as likely to be bullied as those who identify as heterosexual. Students who are bullied are more likely to have depression, anxiety, and sleep problems — and to drop out of school. School-based programs to reduce violence can help prevent bullying of lesbian, gay, and bisexual students. - IVP-09: Reduce homicides † Homicide is a major cause of death in the United States, and there are major disparities by age and race/ethnicity. Strategies to prevent intimate partner violence, child abuse and neglect, and youth violence are critical for reducing homicides. - IVP-10: Reduce nonfatal physical assault injuries Every year in the United States, many people are treated in the emergency department for injuries caused by violent assaults. Strategies to prevent intimate partner violence, child abuse and neglect, and youth violence are key to reducing related nonfatal injuries. To register, please visit the Healthy People 2030 Webinar Series Registration page. About the Series: Throughout the decade, the Healthy People 2030 Webinar Series will feature the latest data on the Leading Health Indicators, Overall Health and Well-Being Measures, and Healthy People 2030 objectives. * Following the webinar, participants will receive instructions on how to obtain CE credit and a certificate. † This objective is a Leading Health Indicator.
