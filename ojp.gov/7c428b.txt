This is a summary of the OJJDP-sponsored "listening session" in which experts from across the Nation and youth with experience in the justice system met to discuss standards and procedures for developing and maintaining beneficial environments in the justice system for LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning) youth. The 2-day session held November 6-7, 2011, addressed the following topics: current State and local policies and practices intended to protect LGBTQ youth who are involved with the child welfare and juvenile justice systems; strategies for addressing homelessness among such youth; LGBTQ youth and "survival" sex; Tribal resolutions and codes that support LGBTQ justice-system issues in Indian Country; the Office for Victims of Crime toolkit for responding to transgender victims of sexual assault; LGBTQ youth of color in interactions with law enforcement; judicial leadership and LGBTQ youth; and a case study of LGBTQ policy and practice at the Administration for Children's Services in New York City. The session featured youth panel discussions and breakout sessions on a range of other subjects, including juvenile justice reform, leadership development, research and data collection, and training needs related to needs and services for LGBTQ youth. Participants' recommendations for improving justice polices and practices in managing LGBTQ youth in the justice system are in the areas of policy and program development; training and technical assistance; partnerships (Federal, State, local, and nongovernmental organizations); and research.
