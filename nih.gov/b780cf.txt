Office for Disparities Research and Workforce Diversity Webinar Series: Advancing Methods and Measures to Examine the Underlying Mechanisms of Violent Deaths in LGBTQ Populations Date Location Overview This webinar presented methods and measures to enhance data collection efforts on violent deaths among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) populations. Due to multiple minority stressors, LGBTQ individuals are at increased risk for suicide and violent death. Health risk literature suggests that LGBTQ people are more likely to die by violent death than their non-LGBTQ peers. At the time of death, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) data are not systematically collected, and actual mortality disparities and the context of those deaths are not well known. This research fills a glaring gap in LGBTQ research, and it will transform the status of mortality data collection to better identify SOGI, which facilitates studies to guide prevention and intervention research around preventable deaths among LGBTQ populations.
