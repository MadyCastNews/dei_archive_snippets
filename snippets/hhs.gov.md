> December/January 2025Vol. 25, No. 10Affirming Transgender, Nonbinary, and Gender-Diverse Youth in Out-of-Home Systems A new course from the Center of Excellence on LGBTQ+ Behavioral Health Equity discusses Safe Havens II, an interactive report that elevates the voices of seven transgender, nonbinary, and gender-diverse youth with lived experience in the child welfare, juvenile justice, and youth homelessness systems and their recommendations for meaningful systems change. The course, from the Center's Ask-Our-Expert series, consists of an 80-minute recorded webinar featuring a panel discussion among Safe Havens II collaborators, including several of the TNGD youth upon whose valuable insights the report was centered, about the challenges this marginalized population faces and how policymakers and allies can better support these youth. The report and webinar are the result of a collaboration between the Center for the Study of Social Policy, Children’s Rights, Lambda Legal, and Unicorn Solutions. A general, noncredit certificate of attendance is available to participants who view the full recording and complete an evaluation.

Beyond the Basics of LGBTQIA2S+ Inclusivity: Resources and Supports to Meet Child Welfare Agencies Where They Are—June 2024 [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://cbexpress.acf.hhs.gov/article/2024/june/beyond-the-basics-of-lgbtqia2s-inclusivity-resources-and-supports-to-meet-child-welfare-agencies-where-they-are/d10d61d387b18250106fb848cebb35de)

> June 2024Vol. 25, No. 5Beyond the Basics of LGBTQIA2S+ Inclusivity: Resources and Supports to Meet Child Welfare Agencies Where They Are Written by the Capacity Building Center for States Children and young people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, intersex, asexual, Two-Spirit, or other gender or sexual identity (LGBTQIA2S+) are disproportionately represented in the child welfare system (Capacity Building Center for States, 2023). This calls on providers across the child welfare network to respond, but there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to progress toward more inclusive LGBTQIA2S+ policies and practices for individual child welfare agencies. Some agencies may just be getting started, while others may have many years of experience developing and implementing inclusive policies and practices. The political climates of the states in which the child welfare agencies operate may also contribute to the disparity in policies and practices among jurisdictions. While the number of pro-equality bills enacted in 2023 more than doubled, the rise of anti-LGBTQIA2S+ health and safety bills nearly quadrupled (Human Rights Campaign, 2024). As a result, a wide variety of resources is needed, especially for those agencies looking to advance their knowledge and practice related to the needs of LGBTQIA2S+ children and young people beyond foundational awareness. This curated collection of resources can help meet agencies where they are—regardless of levels of experience, progress toward more inclusive practices and policies, or political climates—to help them create and sustain more inclusive environments for LGBTQIA2S+ children, young people, and families. Staff Training Child welfare agencies seeking to progress beyond awareness of LGBTQIA2S+ information and challenges can start by offering staff training designed to raise cultural competencies and antidiscrimination requirements (Human Rights Campaign, 2023). The Capacity Building Center for States (Center for States) provides practical information about the needs and challenges faced by LGBTQIA2S+ children and young people at child welfare agencies, including helping agencies do the following: Understand where they are in providing an affirming culture and climate for LGBTQIA2S+ children, young people, and families - Learn how to hold frank and open conversations with staff and caregivers regularly to create a safe and affirming environment for LGBTQIA2S+ children and young people - Make plans for improving the well-being of LGBTQIA2S+ children and young people - Creating an Affirming Culture and Climate for LGBTQIA2S+ Children and Young People in Child Welfare is a Center for States resource to assess agency culture and climate for LGBTQIA2S+ people and learn how to hold frank conversations about LGBTQIA2S+ topics with staff and caregivers. The Center for States also has resources to help agencies create a more affirming culture and climate, increase authentic engagement with families and young people, and engage a diverse and inclusive team, as well as tools to support agencies with serving LGBTQIA2S+ children, young people, and families and implement a more inclusive agency climate for these populations. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services offers training through the National LGBTQIA+ Health Education Center, which includes numerous learning resources such as webinars, publications, learning modules, toolkits, videos, and a glossary (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.). The Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s All Children - All Families is a resource for "child welfare agencies seeking training, technical assistance, and model policies for improving practice" when working with LGBTQIA2S+ children and young people (Human Rights Campaign, 2023). It has established benchmarks of LGBTQ+ inclusion that consider the realities of different levels of progress toward inclusive child welfare policies. Its three levels—building foundation for inclusion, solid foundation for inclusion, and innovative inclusion—progress from basics like improving inclusivity in forms, paperwork, and messaging to intermediate steps like establishing sustainable practices for both young people and parents to advanced steps like serving as inclusivity allies and leaders in the broader community (Human Rights Campaign, 2023). Agencies can participate in the All Children – All Families Agency Self-Assessment (free) or learn more about the National Training Program (fee for service at a sliding scale) (Human Rights Campaign, n.d.). Substance Abuse and Mental Health Supports Agencies that have moved beyond the basics may be considering implementing more intersectional supports, such as those around substance abuse and mental health. The Center for States has resources that prioritize cross-system partnerships and ensure children and young people receive vital mental health services. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration offers a variety of training curricula and resources, such as A Provider’s Introduction to Substance Abuse Treatment for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Individuals; A Practitioner’s Resource Guide: Helping Families to Support Their LGBT Children; and Helping Families Support Their Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) Children (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, n.d.). A particularly important mental health concern for LGBTQIA2S+ children and young people is the risk of suicide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people aged 10 to 14 and the third leading cause among those aged 15 to 24. LGBTQIA2S+ children and young people are more than four times as likely to attempt suicide as their peers (The Trevor Project, 2024). The Trevor Project, a national organization dedicated to ending suicide among LGBTQIA2S+ young people, provides crisis services, research, education and public awareness, and advocacy. The Trevor Project's CARE (Connect, Accept, Respond, Empower) is an interactive and intensive suicide-prevention training that provides adults, including child welfare professionals, kindergarten–12 school staff and educators, higher education staff and faculty, and health-care professionals with an overview of suicide among LGBTQIA2S+ children and young people and "the different environmental stressors that contribute to their heightened risk for suicide" (The Trevor Project, n.d.). Child welfare professionals can promote greater inclusivity for LGBTQIA2S+ children, young people, and families in myriad ways. Whether an agency is just getting started on its journey toward more inclusive practices and culture or seeking ways to add to existing services, numerous resources and organizations are ready to meet them where they are to provide a more welcoming child welfare system for all. Resources The following Center for States resources can help agencies create an affirming culture and climate for LGBTQIA2S+ young people and families: Becoming a Family-Focused System (resource series) - Creating an Affirming Culture and Climate for LGBTQIA2S+ Children and Young People in Child Welfare (resource) - Change and Implementation in Practice: Teaming (resource collection) - Creating LGBTQ-Affirming Agencies (video and discussion guide) - Toolkit to Support Child Welfare Agencies in Serving LGBTQ Children, Youth, and Families (resource collection) - Additional Resources The following resources and organizations present research, data, and policy suggestions that child welfare professionals and agencies can use to create an inclusive culture for LGBTQIA2S+ children, young people, and families: Advocates for Youth (organization) - GLAAD (organization) - Human Rights Campaign Foundation (organization) - Indigenizing Love: A Toolkit for Native Youth to Build Inclusion (resource) - National LGBTQIA+ Health Education Center (organization) (The Fenway Institute) - The National Quality Improvement Center (QIC) on Tailored Services, Placement Stability, and Permanency for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning, and Two-Spirit (LGBTQ2S) Children and Youth in Foster Care (organization) - National SOGIE Center (organization) - The Trevor Project (organization) - Youth Move National Peer Center Issue Brief: Binary Youth in Nonbinary Systems, Part I and Part II (resource) - References Capacity Building Center for States.

Creating an Affirming Culture and Climate for LGBTQIA2S+ Children, Young People, and Families in Child Welfare—October 2023 [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://cbexpress.acf.hhs.gov/article/2023/october/creating-an-affirming-culture-and-climate-for-lgbtqia2s-children-young-people-and-families-in-child-welfare/38c2b17b1b7cf110145dedf7624bcb4c)

> October 2023Vol. 24, No. 8Creating an Affirming Culture and Climate for LGBTQIA2S+ Children, Young People, and Families in Child Welfare Written by the Capacity Building Center for States Children and young people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and/or gender expansive, queer and/or questioning, intersex, asexual, and two-spirit (LGBTQIA2S+) are disproportionately represented in the child welfare system, where they may encounter challenges ranging from discrimination and unequal access to appropriate services to homelessness and more (National Association of Social Workers, n.d.; Trevor Project, 2021; U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2022). Research consistently shows that these young people experience higher rates of mental health concerns, substance use, homelessness, and suicidality compared to their heterosexual and cisgender peers (National Alliance on Mental Health, n.d.). This is even more true for those LGBTQIA2S+ children and young people with additional marginalized identities such as non-White race, non-European ethnicity, or immigrant status. For example, American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) LGBTQIA2S+ young people were 2.5 times more likely to report a suicide attempt in the past year (33 percent) compared to non-American Indian/Alaska Native LGBTQIA2S+ young people (14 percent) (Zongrone, et al., 2020). The struggles and challenges faced by LGBTQIA2S+ children and young people in child welfare demand our urgent attention. By acknowledging the disparities they face and working to address them, we can take meaningful steps toward creating a child welfare system that is truly inclusive, supportive, and respectful of the diverse identities within its care. Establish Unambiguous Policies Prohibiting Discriminatory Actions Against LGBTQIA2S+ People Despite the existence of federal laws that address the safety and well-being of children and young people in foster care, including those with LGBTQIA2S+ identities, anti-LGBTQIA2S+ legislation continues to be introduced. For example, in 2023 so far, 80 anti-transgender bills have been passed by legislatures in 22 states, and more are pending. ACF Information Memorandum 22-01 states that public child welfare agencies must address the needs of children and young people in their care, including needs related to sexual orientation and gender identity expression (SOGIE). To that end, child welfare agencies must establish clear, unambiguous policies that explicitly prohibit discrimination based on SOGIE. These policies should also outline the steps to be taken if such discrimination occurs. Additional policy-related actions agencies can take include the following: Creating or amending a foster care bill of rights that specifies rights related to LGBTQIA2S+ identity - Hiring a dedicated staff member responsible for policy, best practices, and guidance for serving LGBTQIA2S+ children, young people, and families engaged with the agency - Collecting data related to SOGIE to understand whether the agency is properly serving LGBTQIA2S+ children and young people - Establishing consistent practice around asking for and using correct pronouns and chosen names in all conversations and documentation - Institute Regular Cultural Competency Training Many child welfare professionals lack the training and cultural competency to understand the unique needs of LGBTQIA2S+ young people, which can hinder the provision of appropriate services and care. All child welfare professionals and their partners should attend trainings that enhance their understanding of issues unique to SOGIE and LGBTQIA2S+ young people (including Latinx and Black LGBTQIA2S+ young people) and offer practical strategies they can apply in their work. Such issues may include access to affirming care, the importance of using correct pronouns and chosen names, and creating inclusive environments. Tribal and jurisdictional agencies should also take steps to educate staff about Two-Spirit and other AI/AN nondominant SOGIE identities to better serve LGBTQIA2S+ AI/AN children and young people in care. Child welfare agencies should partner with LGBTQIA2S+ organizations to develop training materials, resources, and support networks. These collaborations can offer expertise and insights that contribute to a more informed and empathetic approach toward LGBTQIA2S+ children, young people, and families. Make Your Agency a Safe Space for LGBTQIA2S+ Children, Young People, and Families Creating safe spaces for LGBTQIA2S+ children, young people, and families within the child welfare system is essential, and it is important that the agency be one of them. Some actions the agency can take include hanging “All Are Welcome” signs and rainbow flags in social services buildings, updating all forms with inclusive language, and adding SOGIE-related language to posted nondiscrimination policies and promotional and information materials. In addition, offering support groups, counseling services, and resources that affirm LGBTQIA2S+ identities can play a pivotal role in fostering a sense of belonging and reducing the mental health challenges faced by LGBTQIA2S+ children and young people. As you consider the information, data, and resources below, take time to think about the ways you and your agency are currently creating safe spaces for LGBTQIA2S+ individuals and the actions you can take to affirm and support LGBTQIA2S+ children, young people, and families. Resources The following Center for States resources can help agencies create an affirming culture and climate for LGBTQIA2S+ young people and families.

> July/August 2022Vol. 23, No. 6Discriminatory Transgender Health Bills Have Critical Consequences for Youth Child Trends published a brief that provides the context, definitions, and benefits of gender-affirming care as well as how anti-LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and/or questioning) health policies harm LGBTQ+ youth. Young people are increasingly expressing gender identities that are different than the genders they were assigned at birth. At the same time, several states are passing discriminatory laws that deny access to gender-affirming care or criminalizing adults that facilitate it. Having access to gender-affirming care has been proven to be beneficial, while preventing access leads to poor mental and physical health outcomes. Gender-affirming care is developmentally dependent and appropriate and can include name, pronoun, and identification card changes. For older adolescents, it may include, after careful consideration, puberty blockers and supportive hormone therapy. When transgender youth are supported in their identities, they have outcomes–including for mental health and academics—more in line with their cisgender peers. When health care aimed at LGBTQ+ youth is made inaccessible or criminalized, it can increase youth's overall risk of experiencing violence and poorer health outcomes. The brief also provides recommendations that policymakers can use to create gender-affirming policies. Child welfare and related professionals on all levels should recognize the importance of gender-affirming care and understand that it is a necessary, medically indicated treatment. Policies should focus on ensuring and protecting transgender youth's access to gender-affirming care.

> March 2016Vol. 17, No. 1Endorsing Appropriate Therapeutic Practices for LGBTQ Youth A recent report from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) delivers a research-based, expert-endorsed overview of health community efforts to provide supportive, encouraging, positive environments for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer and questioning youth. Its findings focus on the harms of conversion therapy—the practice of attempting to change someone's sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. The report's recommendations are based on specific consensus statements by experts in the field. Three key findings from the group's consensus statements are highlighted in the report summary: - Same-gender sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression are within the normal range of sexuality expression—they are not classified as a mental disorder. - Existing research does not support mental or behavioral health interventions aimed at changing gender identity or sexual orientation. - Behavioral health interventions to modify gender identity or expression, or to ensure conformity to heterosexual orientation, can harm, not help; therefore, they should not be practiced. Clinical issues in childhood are also addressed in the report. Distress over nonconformity of sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression can contribute to gender dysphoria, which is defined as significant distress experienced by gender nonconforming children. This distress is characterized by increased risk of behavioral health issues and internalizing disorders, including depression and anxiety, compared to children in the general population. Research findings confirm that the parental and peer relationships of gender minority children, on average, are poorer than those of the general population; their peers are more likely to mistreat them or to physically or sexually abuse them. Researchers and clinical experts provide the following guidance and resources to families and others working with LGBTQ children and adolescents: - Support of diverse family, caregiver, and kinship systems within families, cultures, and faith communities - Access to accurate information about sexual orientation and gender identity - Application of a family support model of assistance to diverse families, including conservative ones, to support their LGBTQ children while accounting for their values and beliefs - Building of safe and supportive school environments - Understanding of appropriate therapeutic approaches by pediatricians working with LGBTQ children and their families. The authors of this report conclude that it is not just important to end potentially harmful practices such as conversion therapy, but that it is also imperative that the communities surrounding LGBTQ youth construct supportive environments and work to eradicate negative social attitudes toward them.

The factsheet, Supporting LGBTQ+ Youth: A Guide for Foster Parents, describes the unique challenges this at-risk population of youth face and how foster parents can help reduce those risks and ensure youth feel safe and supported. This factsheet was developed to help families understand the complex experiences of LGBTQ+ youth in foster care and the importance of and how to provide a nurturing and affirming home environment. It also provides specific actions that families can take to promote youth health and well-being at home and in the community.

> October 2022Vol. 23, No. 8Homelessness and Housing Instability Among LGBTQ Youth Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer and/or questioning (LGBTQ) youth are overrepresented among young people experiencing homeless and housing instability. These housing issues in turn increase LGBTQ youth's risk of mental health and other challenges compared with their LGBTQ peers who have stable housing. The Trevor Project published a report, Homeless and Housing Instability Among LGBTQ Youth, which explores the complex connection between LGBTQ youth, homelessness, and mental health challenges. It also details the challenges of collecting data on the housing status of LGBTQ youth as well as the impact of COVID-19. Data were collected through an online survey that targeted youth on social media. Questions measured the rate of housing instability, related mental health outcomes, and other factors associated with housing instability. The data showed that 28 percent of LGBTQ youth reported experiencing homelessness or housing instability, with much higher rates (44 percent) for Native/Indigenous LGBTQ youth. Additionally, 28 percent of LGBTQ youth who experienced housing instability and 35 percent of LGBTQ youth who were currently experiencing homelessness reported a suicide attempt in the past year compared with 10 percent of youth who had not experienced housing instability. The report also provided recommendations for preventing and addressing LGBTQ youth homelessness based on the survey data and perspectives from housing advocates. Potential areas of improvement include the following: Implementing strong antidiscrimination policies to prevent LGBTQ youth homelessness - Increasing funding for low-barrier housing programs - Reimagining shelter services - Improving data collection on LGBTQ youth homelessness - Creating antipoverty economic policies to lessen economic burdens of low-income families - The full data and recommendations are available in the report.

> November 2021Vol. 22, No. 10How Foster Parents Can Support Their LGBTQ+ Child The challenges and trauma that many youth in foster care have experienced or will experience can be compounded for youth identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (or sometimes questioning), and others (LGBTQ+). As a result, they need foster parents who are supportive, willing to listen and learn, practice empathy, and advocate. An article on Parents.com discusses the overrepresentation of LGTBQ+ youth in the foster care system and the associated problems this subset of marginalized youth may encounter. It includes details from an interview with a child welfare professional who was in foster care as a youth and is a gay Black man. He describes how foster parents can mitigate the struggles that LGBTQ+ youth may face while in their care and provides guidance and tips on what foster parents should and should not do when caring for a LGBTQ+ child. He focuses on the need for foster parents to proactively educate themselves on topics such as individual expression, gender role and identity, common stereotypes, and the use of appropriate versus discriminatory terms and phrases.

While developed for use by crisis and mental health counselors, such as those with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Line (formerly known as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline), this course and the important information presented therein can also benefit professionals from child welfare and many other disciplines in their work with individuals and families. The hour-long, self-paced course, “Introduction to LGBTQ+ Populations With Special Considerations for the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline,” which is available on the E-Learning Modules page of the center’s website, addresses LGBTQ+ terminology, including which terms to avoid and why; gender pronouns and associated best practices; how to speak with and about the LGBTQ+ community in an affirming and respectful way; mental health considerations; the coming out process; and more. This and other eligible e-learning sessions offer 1.0 free continuing education credit (accredited by the Council on Social Work Education) or a noncredit certificate of attendance upon successful completion of the online training module, pre/posttest, and evaluation.

> May 2012Vol. 13 No. 4LGBTQ Cultural Competency Assessment The National Center for Cultural Competence at Georgetown University Center for Child and Human Development recently posted a self-assessment checklist designed to raise service providers' awareness and sensitivity when working with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning (LGBTQ) youth and their families. The checklist is composed of three sections: Physical environment, materials, and resources - Communication practices - Values and attitudes - For each self-assessment statement, the provider answers A (I do this frequently), B (I do this occasionally), or C (I do this rarely or never). While there is no answer key, the National Center for Cultural Competence suggests that if a provider answers with mostly C's, he or she needs to try implementing practices that are more culturally competent, creating a safe and welcoming environment for LGBTQ youth and their families. Self-Assessment Checklist for Personnel Providing Services and Supports to LGBTQ Youth and Their Families is available on the National Center for Cultural Competence's website: http://nccc.georgetown.edu/documents/Final%20LGBTQ%20Checklist.pdf (53 KB)

> December/January 2015Vol. 15, No. 11Los Angeles Survey of LGBTQ Youth in Care Accurate data about the number of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth in foster care can help practitioners and policymakers better serve this population. A recent report based on the Los Angeles Foster Youth Survey (LAFYS) sheds light on the number, demographics, and outcomes of LGBTQ youth in Los Angeles County, CA. The Williams Institute and Holarchy Consulting conducted the LAFYS as part of the L.A. LGBT Center's RISE (Recognize Intervene Support Empower) Project, which was awarded funding by the Children's Bureau through the Permanency Innovations Initiative. The survey included 786 randomly selected youth ages 12–21 who were in foster care in Los Angeles County. Results indicate that approximately 19 percent (1,400) of the 7,400 youth in foster care in Los Angeles County identify as LGBTQ, which is between 1.5 to 2 times higher than youth not residing in foster care. Compared to non-LGBTQ youth in foster care, LGBTQ youth in foster care experience a higher number of placements and were more likely to live in a group home, be hospitalized for emotional reasons, and be homeless at some point in their life. The report outlines implications for policymakers, caregivers, and researchers, including addressing oppressions within the child welfare system and how to improve data collection. The report, Sexual and Gender Minority Youth in Foster Care: Assessing Disproportionality and Disparities in Los Angeles, is available at http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/safe-schools-and-youth/lafys-aug-2014/. The February 2014 issue of Children's Bureau Express spotlighted LGBTQ youth and included articles about an initiative addressing the challenges affecting LGBTQ youth in child welfare settings, a guide to help child welfare professionals better care for LGBTQ youth in foster care, and more. The Spotlight section is available at https://cbexpress.acf.hhs.gov/index.cfm?event=website.viewHomepage&issueID=154.

> August 2012Vol. 13, No. 7New Practice Guidelines for Serving LGBTQ Youth Commissioner Bryan Samuels of the Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) endorsed a set of practice guidelines to support the safety and well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, and questioning (LGBTQ) children and youth. The practice guidelines, produced by the Child Welfare League of America and Lambda Legal, outline best practices for improving positive outcomes and ensuring the safety of LGBTQ children and youth, who are largely overrepresented in the child welfare system. Specifically, the guidelines are targeted toward working with LGBTQ youth who are at risk of or are living with HIV and involved with child welfare. Recommendations include: Adopt policies prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and HIV status - Provide services that address family rejection - Provide services to increase access to medical and mental health care for youth at risk of or living with HIV - Implement services to support transgender and gender-nonconforming youth - Recommended Practices to Promote the Safety and Well-Being of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Questioning (LGBTQ) Youth and Youth at Risk of or Living With HIV in Child Welfare Settings is available on Lambda Legal's website: http://www.lambdalegal.org/publications/recommended-practices-youth

> June 2024Vol. 25, No. 5New Resource Helps Support LGBTQ+ Youth in School, Health, and Child Welfare Settings The Center for the Study of Social Policy and the National SOGIE Center released a frequently asked questions brief to help professionals in behavioral health, child welfare, and educational settings support youth who identify as LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, or other gender or sexual identity). The brief explores common legal challenges associated with working with LGBTQ+ individuals and outlines federal protections and resources. Legal challenges associated with working with LGTBQ+ individuals may stem from anti-LGBTQ+ policies, such as prohibiting the discussion of certain topics or the use of certain words or denying services based on sexual orientation or gender identity. As professionals, it can be difficult to know how to respond to these situations. The document provides answers to eight frequently asked questions from professionals who work in behavioral health, child welfare, and school settings. Each response features recommended approaches to challenges and links to additional resources. The following are examples of the questions included: I can't talk to young people about sexual orientation or gender identity and expression unless I get written permission from their families. What can I do? - Can I write a letter of support for gender-affirming treatment if my state or locality is debating whether affirming care is "abuse"? - I've been instructed to use a youth's legal name on documentation instead of their affirmed or chosen name. What can I do? - The brief is designed to help providers navigate complicated policy challenges related to supporting LGBTQ+ youth and their families. While it provides strategies and resources, it is important to note that the brief is not a substitute for legal advice. FAQ for Behavioral Health Providers: Supporting LGBTQ+ Youth in School, Health, and Child Welfare Settings is available on the Center for the Study of Social Policy website.

> June 2024Vol. 25, No. 5New Training on Adapting Family Finding and Engagement Practices for LGBTQ+ Youth A new online training from the National SOGIE Center provides information on supporting young people who identify as LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, or other gender or sexual identity) during family finding and engagement processes. The free, 45-minute training provides information on supporting these young people and helping the adults in their lives understand and support them as well. Having a solid support network and lifelong connections is essential for all youth and young adults, especially those in and aging out of foster care. Young people in care who identify as LGBTQ+ may need additional support forging new connections and nurturing existing relationships due to unique stressors, such as disclosing their LGBTQ+ identity. In addition, the adults in their lives may need guidance on how to best support and affirm these young people. The training is provided by the National SOGIE Center and the National Quality Improvement Center on Tailored Services, Placement Stability, and Permanency for LGBTQ2S Children and Youth in Foster Care and is available on the National SOGIE Center website. The SOGIE Center offers a series of other trainings related to supporting LGBTQ+ youth, such as a training on creating affirming environments, best practices, and proper terminology.

QIC-LGBTQ2S is a Children's Bureau-funded program lead by the the Institute for Innovation and Implementation at the University of Maryland School of Social Work. During the course of 5 years, QIC-LGBTQ2S partnered with four implementation sites (Allegheny County, PA; Michigan; Cuyahoga County, OH; and Prince George's County, MD) to develop, implement, and evaluate several best practices and programs for LGBTQ+ youth and their families. In addition to developing these programs, the implementation sites also engaged in several initiatives to create policies and SOGIE (sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression) data-collection initiatives. This June, QIC-LGBTQ2S highlights the following resources to support LGBTQ2S youth and families: - "Rollout of Data Collection on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity" [Infographic] - "Cuyahoga County's System Transformation for Serving LGBTQ+ Youth in Foster Care" [Infographic] - Implementation tip sheets: - Youth and family programing information sheets: - "Journey Ahead" - "Youth AFFIRM: Affirmative Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender & Questioning (LGBTQ+) Populations" - "AFFIRM Caregiver: Affirmative Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Caregivers of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender & Questioning (LGBTQ+) Populations" - "Chosen Affirming Family Finding"

One such project is focused specifically on supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) young people in foster care. The Opening Doors project provides tools and resources to professionals in the legal and child welfare communities to support their work in improving outcomes for this high-risk population. The project website links to a variety of trainings, publications, and other information, including the companion It's Your Life interactive website (and publication with the same name) for LGBTQ youth. The website was created to help LGBTQ youth in foster care navigate the child welfare system and understand their rights. It also provides a Where to Get Help section for LGBTQ youth that may be in crisis or otherwise in need of assistance with issues pertaining to harassment, violence, discrimination, homelessness, education, health, and sexuality. Additionally, the project website provides a section of issue-specific legal updates and connects individuals with other pertinent ABA and non-ABA projects and related groups.

> June 2024Vol. 25, No. 5Scoping Review Explores Research on LGBTQ Youth and Caregivers in Child Welfare Individuals who identify as members of the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning) community are prevalent in child welfare, with LGBTQ youth being overrepresented in care and an increasing number of LGBTQ people becoming foster parents. A scoping review published in Child and Family Social Work examines research on child welfare practice with LGBTQ youth, caregivers, and foster caregivers. The review is anchored in the following research questions: What is known about the practices of child welfare services toward LGBTQ youth and caregivers? - What is known about LGBTQ foster parents? - Forty-five studies published between 2000 and 2021 met the inclusion criteria, with the majority taking place in the United States and after 2014. The included studies are organized into three theme categories: LGBTQ youth in contact with child welfare services, foster parents, and child welfare practice from an LGBTQ perspective. While the review shows that published literature about LGBTQ youth and caregivers is increasing, it also shows there are relatively few empirical peer-reviewed studies on the topic. The findings indicate that LGBTQ youth are disproportionately represented in child welfare and have an increased risk for adverse health outcomes compared with non-LGBTQ youth. However, there are limited data on the number of LGBTQ youth in the system and no studies estimate the number of foster parents who identify as LGBTQ. The review highlights several areas where more research is needed, including research on the following topics: Caseworker attitudes, knowledge, and experiences working with LGBTQ individuals - Non-LGBTQ foster parents of LGBTQ youth - Interventions to support LGBTQ youth - Transgender and intersex people within child welfare - The intersection of being LGBTQ and seeking health care - More information is available in the review, "What is Known About the LGBTQ Perspective in Child Welfare Services: A Scoping Review."

Although it is not known how many lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) children and youth are involved with the child welfare system, their safety, permanency, and well-being often are negatively affected because of their sexual identity. They frequently encounter harassment and mistreatment by peers and staff, homophobia, family rejection, a lack of appropriate and available services, and a lack of knowledge about how to serve this population. Additionally, LGBTQ children and youth in foster care often experience additional and more unstable placements and are placed in group homes more often than their heterosexual peers (Mallon, 2011). The L.A. Gay & Lesbian Center (http://laglc.convio.net/) seeks to address barriers to permanency for LGBTQ children and youth through its RISE (Recognize Intervene Support Empower) Initiative, which is part of the Children's Bureau's PII. The center's existing core services for youth include drop-in and housing services, as well as mentoring and other positive youth development programs for LGBTQ youth. Center staff report that approximately 50 percent of the more than 60 youth who visit the drop-in center each day have been in the foster care system. The RISE project has completed its planning year, which was required for all PII grantees, and its staff are excited to begin pilot testing the interventions they have developed and providing project services to LGBTQ children and youth in 2012. RISE is composed of the following: Outreach: RISE staff are drafting two protocols to help educate caseworkers and placement agency workers about how to discuss sexual identity issues at a developmentally appropriate level. One protocol will be for children ages 3 to 10, and the other will be for youth ages 11 to 17. The protocols also will include how workers can maintain privacy and confidentiality, whether and how to document any self-disclosures, how to ensure the child or youth is safe, and how to let RISE staff know if a child or youth self-identifies as LGBTQ and agrees to participate in the project. - Identification: The project is developing a computer-based survey focused on youth development and will ask questions about identity (including, but not exclusively, sexual orientation and gender identity) and safety issues. Initially, the survey will be administered annually to youth in 4 of L.A.'s 18 local offices, with additional offices to be included later. All youth in those offices will be asked to complete the survey regardless of whether they are or are perceived to be LGBTQ. All data will be de-identified to maintain the youths' confidentiality. This information hopefully will help shape agency practice and inform the field about the numbers and experiences of LGBTQ youth. - Care Coordination Teams (CCTs): RISE will provide wraparound-like services to LGBTQ youth in order to strengthen or build their family networks, which include their immediate birth families and an extended network of family and friends, and achieve permanency at one or more of the following levels: durable family connections, emotional permanency, and legal permanency. The project expects many of the youth receiving CCT services to be referred to the initiative by RISE partner agencies and county offices. Project staff will work with the families in the treatment group to increase family support for the youth, decrease family rejection, and help them be more affirming of the youth's sexual identity. They also will help the families better understand the risks and resiliencies of LGBTQ youth. Project staff will be careful not to reject the family's value system; rather, they will work with the family to show how the youth's sexual identity can be compatible with it. - Training and Coaching Institute (TCI): The TCI will be the mechanism through which RISE trains and coaches caseworkers and others about the other three components. - RISE staff feel that the CCT services may require a shift in thinking among caseworkers and service providers. LGBTQ youths' parents, often due to their prior rejection of the youth, usually are not viewed as potential permanency resources, whereas this project aims to reconnect LGBTQ youth with their families when appropriate and possible. As the project moves into its pilot testing phase, Curt Shepard, Director of Children, Youth & Family Services at the L.A. Gay & Lesbian Center, expressed his enthusiasm for this project's potential. "With the RISE Initiative, the L.A. Gay & Lesbian Center has been given a profoundly important opportunity. If we succeed in reaching our goals, we will have found ways to hasten the progress down the path to permanency for LGBTQ children and youth in foster care. What we envision is nothing short of a sea change in the way the child welfare system cares for LGBTQ children and youth." References Mallon, G. P. (2011). Permanency for LGBTQ youth.

> February 2014Vol. 15, No. 2Stories From LGBTQ Youth in Care Represent magazine utilizes youth-written stories to provide information and encouragement to youth in foster care and offer professionals insight into the related challenges this population faces. The real-life stories span a variety of topics, including child abuse, experiences in foster care, aging out of care, mental health, LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning) matters, and many others. Represent currently has over 50 stories on a range of LGBTQ topics; most are written by teens about their LGBTQ-related challenges. The site also includes "in the news" pieces—a study on gay adoptive parents and a story on the gay foster parent debate. In one story, 14-year-old Mariah, a transgender male, explains the importance of finding a supportive foster care group home. She describes what being transgender really means, her entry into foster care, the challenges she struggled with—abuse, often physical, from her peers and social work staff—and the associated feelings of helplessness and hopelessness that led to running away from a group home. Ultimately, she was able to find a bed at a group home for gay and transgender boys, where she feels more comfortable and accepted. Represent is a quarterly magazine published by Youth Communication, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to help marginalized teens strengthen the social, emotional, and literacy skills that contribute to success in school, work, and life.

> June 2014Vol. 15, No. 6Tips for Professionals Serving LGBTQ Youth The National Child Traumatic Stress Network released a new factsheet designed to familiarize mental health professionals with the appropriate terminology when working with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth. This resource also may be valuable to child welfare and other related professionals who work with LGBTQ children and youth and their families. The publication includes a definition and description of the following terms: Sexual orientation - Gender identity - Transgender - Gender expression - Queer - Questioning - Supported by diagrams and research findings, this resource illustrates the continuum of sex, gender, and sexual orientation and dispels myths and stereotypes about LGBTQ youth and sexual abuse. The factsheet also outlines key steps to creating a welcoming environment, maintaining confidentiality, and counseling clients after sexual abuse. Particular areas of concern related to the fear of disclosure, a lack of a safe arena to discuss one's sexual orientation, and the risk of self-harm are also addressed. Finally, the authors encourage professionals to follow local and national professional guidelines and policies for working with LGBTQ youth and individuals.

Using Technology to Create Safe Spaces for LGBTQIA2S+ Youth in Reunification—June 2024 [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://cbexpress.acf.hhs.gov/article/2024/june/using-technology-to-create-safe-spaces-for-lgbtqia2s-youth-in-reunification/501651418742c210978775d9cebb3566)

> June 2024Vol. 25, No. 5Using Technology to Create Safe Spaces for LGBTQIA2S+ Youth in Reunification Written by Children's Bureau Division of State Systems staff Child welfare agencies aim to provide a safe and supportive environment for children and youth who are working toward family reunification. A secure environment is especially needed during the reunification of youth who identify as LGBTQIA2S+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex, asexual, Two-Spirit, and other diverse gender and sexual identities). According to Youth.gov, LGBTQ+ youth are overrepresented in child welfare systems, even though they are likely to be underreported because they risk harassment and abuse if their LGBTQ+ identity is disclosed.1 Studies have found that about 30 percent of youth in foster care identify as LGBTQ+ and 5 percent as transgender, in comparison to 11 percent and 1 percent, respectively, of youth not in foster care.2 Furthermore, LGBTQ+ youth of color are disproportionately overrepresented and stay longer in child welfare systems while also having an increased risk of experiencing discrimination and violence compared to their peers.3 Reunification Challenges These young LGBTQIA2S+ individuals often face unique challenges and barriers during the reunification process: - Lack of understanding: Some adults or other professionals involved in the youth's life may lack awareness about LGBTQIA2S+ issues. - Stigma or discrimination: Fear of stigma prevents some LGBTQIA2S+ youth from seeking help or asking important questions. - Access to information: Some LGBTQIA2S+ youth may need digital resources to navigate relevant topics or locate other youth in similar situations. However, technology can play a pivotal role in helping to address their information needs, foster safe and inclusive environments, and reduce some potential reunification barriers. Safe Digital Spaces Today’s technology can provide a lifeline by creating safe digital spaces where LGBTQIA2S+ youth can connect with their peers, find support, and express their authentic selves, such as the following examples: - Safe space apps have been developed specifically for LGBTQIA2S+ youth to provide information on local resources, legal rights, and mental health support. Having access to this material can empower LGBTQIA2S+ youth to better advocate for themselves during the reunification process. - Mental health apps can provide virtual counseling and therapy. These tools allow LGBTQIA2S+ youth to access mental health services discreetly to address their emotional well-being during the reunification process. - Online support groups can offer safe spaces for LGBTQIA2S+ youth to share their experiences, seek advice, and build connections. Some platforms also allow anonymity, which can be crucial for those youth who fear judgment but need the advice of others sharing related reunification events. Technology for Empowerment During the reunification process, LGBTQIA2S+ youth can also investigate the following youth-centric technology: - Interactive websites: This technology engages youth with topics such as frequently asked questions, success stories, relevant advice, and video testimonials from LGBTQIA2S+ individuals who have navigated the reunification process successfully. - Youth advisory boards: Some digital platforms facilitate virtual youth advisory boards where LGBTQIA2S+ youth can actively participate in shaping child welfare policies and technology systems. Their insights can drive positive changes for the reunification process of current and future LGBTQIA2S+ youth. - Learning resources: Webinars, training modules, and e-learning resources that offer relevant LGBTQIA2S+ youth topics are available online. Adult and Caregiver Resources To learn more about LGBTQIA2S+ youth concerns, the following adult and caregiver resources may be available: - Online training modules: Adults in a youth's life or interested child welfare professionals can access trainings or online modules on topics such as LGBTQIA2S+ cultural competency, pronoun usage, and self-care. - Virtual workshops: Hosted webinars and workshops held for parents, kin (including maternal and paternal relatives as well as fictive kin), foster parents, and child welfare professionals can bring understanding and acceptance of LGBTQIA2S+ youth as well as a successful reunification outcome. Summary Technology has the potential to transform lives and improve the reunification process for LGBTQIA2S+ youth. By creating safe digital spaces, breaking down barriers, empowering youth, and helping their adult caregivers, technology can help ensure that every young person feels seen, heard, and valued. Let’s embrace technology as a positive catalyst for change to build a more inclusive future for everyone.

> February 2014Vol. 15, No. 2Spotlight on LGBTQ Youth It is estimated that 5 to 10 percent of the children and youth in foster care identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning (LGBTQ). It is likely that this population is much higher, and these youth face unique challenges and have specific needs. This month's CBX looks at an initiative by the Center for the Study of Social Policy on the challenges affecting LGBTQ youth in child welfare settings, a guide to help child welfare professionals better care for LGBTQ youth in foster care, and more. Issue Spotlight Caring for LGBTQ ChildrenCaring for LGBTQ Children Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth in foster care are not only disproportionately represented in care, they often face discrimination and abuse while in care. As part of its All Children — All Families project, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) is engaging child welfare agencies and providing resources and technical assistance and training on best practices for serving LGBTQ youth and LGBTQ families. One such resource is a guide for child welfare professionals on caring for LGBTQ children and youth in foster care. The guide offers LGBTQ definitions and terms, data about LGBTQ children and youth growing up in the United States, and information about the legal rights of this population. Also included is a brief introduction to SOGIE (sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression). The Human Rights Campaign calls for a shift in focus from LGBTQ youth to SOGIE for all children, because every child has a sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression, and healthy development of SOGIE is paramount to every child's well-being. Resources and websites to help professionals serve all children and youth in foster care are also provided. In addition to the guide, the All Children — All Families program offers agencies an LGBTQ cultural competency self-assessment with 10 policy and practice benchmarks. Agencies that achieve each benchmark are awarded a Seal of Recognition from the HRC. Caring for LGBTQ Children and Youth: A Guide for Child Welfare Providers is available on the Human Rights Campaign website: http://www.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/HRC_Caring_For_LGBTQ_Children_Youth.pdf (2 MB) For more information on the All Children — All Families Benchmarks of LGBT Cultural Competency, visit http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/benchmarks-of-lgbt-cultural-competency. - Stories From LGBTQ Youth in CareStories From LGBTQ Youth in Care Represent magazine utilizes youth-written stories to provide information and encouragement to youth in foster care and offer professionals insight into the related challenges this population faces.

Initiative Studies show that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth involved in the child welfare system generally have poorer outcomes than their peers. These youth often come into contact with child welfare as a direct result of the maltreatment and rejection they received from family and community because of their sexual orientation and gender identity. Furthermore, there is little information about the prevalence of LGBTQ youth in the child welfare system, which hinders the system's ability to provide needed services and improve outcomes for this at-risk population. A new initiative by the Center for the Study of Social Policy (CSSP)—get R.E.A.L. (Recognize. Engage, Affirm. Love.)—was designed to address the challenges affecting LGBTQ youth in child welfare settings; to transform child welfare policy and practice to more effectively serve this population; and to ensure that healthy sexual development and gender expression are part of the framework that child welfare agencies use to promote the healthy development of all children and youth. The get R.E.A.L. project focuses on the following components: Demonstrating the effectiveness of the Guidelines for Managing Information Related to Sexual Orientation and Gender Expression and Identity of Children in Child Welfare Systems, a publication by the National Center for Lesbian Rights, Family Builders, Legal Services for Children, and CSSP that provides a template for service providers that can be used to manage youth's personal information related to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression - Developing a policy and practice model to address healthy sexual and gender identity for LGBTQ youth in child welfare and other service systems - Creating a network of national organizations committed to improving the well-being of LGBTQ youth in child welfare as a means of information-sharing and advocacy - Delivering technical assistance to child welfare agencies that wish to use the guidelines noted above to implement systems change and improve outcomes for all youth in the area of healthy sexual and identity development - To read more about the get R.E.A.L. initiative, visit the CSSP website: http://www.cssp.org/reform/child-welfare/get-r-e-a-l Related Items As part of the get R.E.A.L. initiative, CSSP also links to State Policies Concerning LGBTQ Youth. Current as of September 2013, this document provides a comprehensive, State-by-State look at the policies affecting LGBTQ youth. Areas addressed include public accommodations, social services (general), child welfare (specific services and programs), foster care (including child care centers, housing, and training), juvenile detention/services, school and educational facilities, and social worker guidelines.

Each Child Welfare Research and Evaluation Workgroup was asked to examine a particular evaluation topic with the goal of improving child welfare research and evaluation and strengthening the link between research and practice. The workgroups met over several months in 2012 and 2013, and they created products in response to pressing evaluation needs in the field of child welfare. The products are intended to be practical tools and relevant for multiple audiences, including program directors and evaluators, child welfare agency administrators, funders of research studies and evaluation projects, and other important stakeholders who rely on child welfare evaluation. In 2014, the Children's Bureau will release publications from each of the workgroups and brief videos that will highlight their key messages and recommendations. Be on the lookout for the following products that will be announced via the Children's Bureau listservs and made available on the Children's Bureau website in early 2014.Cost Analysis in Program Evaluation: A Guide for Child Welfare Researchers and Service Providers - A Framework to Design, Test, Spread, and Sustain Effective Practice in Child Welfare - A Roadmap for Collaborative and Effective Evaluation in Tribal Communities - Visit the Children's Bureau website often to see what's new! http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb - Cost Analysis in Program Evaluation: A Guide for Child Welfare Researchers and Service Providers - CBX Launches New WebsiteCBX Launches New Website Welcome to the new year and the new Children's Bureau Express (CBX)!

The Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) was authorized by Congress in 2010 as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The ongoing evaluation is intended to increase the evidence base on teen pregnancy prevention programs and the knowledge about successes and challenges in replicating and scaling up these programs. While State PREP grantees are allowed to design their programs, curricula must align with four requirements: programs must (1) be evidence-based; (2) provide education on abstinence and contraception use; (3) educate youth on a minimum of three of six adulthood preparation topics (healthy relationships, adolescent development, financial literacy, parent-child communication, education and employment skills, and healthy life skills); and (4) target high-risk populations, such as youth in foster care, adjudicated youth, minority youth, and pregnant or parenting teens. Interviews with grantee officials in 44 States and the District of Columbia found the following:More than 90 percent of the 300,000 expected PREP participants will be served by evidence-based programs. - Three-fourths of the programs are targeting high-risk youth populations, primarily serving African-American and Hispanic youth, youth in foster care, and adjudicated youth. - Approximately half of State programs have assessed their program models to address both abstinence and contraception use. - Continued program implementation evaluation will be carried out through a second round of telephone interviews later this year, in addition to analysis of performance management data provided by grantees and the impacts of PREP-funded programs in four or five sites using a random assignment design. The report is the first by the PREP Multicomponent Evaluation led by Mathematica Policy Research. The Personal Responsibility Education Program: Launching a Nationwide Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Effort, by Susan Zief, Rach Shapiro, and Debra Strong, is available on the OPRE website: http://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/opre/prep_eval_design_survey_report_102213.pdf (2 MB) - CB Capacity Building ServicesCB Capacity Building Services The Children's Bureau (CB) continues to be committed to helping States, Tribes, and Territories build and enhance their capacities to improve child welfare services and achieve better outcomes for children, youth, and families. Just as many public child welfare agencies and their partners are striving to systematically collect information, learn from it, and implement strategies to improve, CB recently concluded an assessment of its capacity building services. This included listening to a variety of stakeholders and reviewing feedback directly from child welfare systems and technical assistance providers. Research literature, evaluation studies, and information gained from informal interviews, focus groups, and listening sessions with child welfare agency managers, professional associations, Federal staff, and service providers also informed CB's decision-making. Based on its assessment, CB has begun to pursue a course that it hopes will better meet the nation's training and technical assistance needs. CB anticipates that from April 2014 through March 2015, its capacity building services will undergo a transition period as current technical assistance awards conclude, new Federal opportunities are competed, and newly funded projects get underway. The majority of CB-supported services will remain available during this transition, but child welfare professionals and jurisdictions that frequently request and receive training and technical assistance from the National Child Welfare Resource Centers may experience limitations on the type and scope of services available during this time. CB looks forward to sharing more information about the future of its capacity building services in the coming months. - Tribal Title IV-E ProgramsTribal Title IV-E Programs The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoption Act of 2008 authorized federally recognized Tribes, Tribal consortia, and Tribal organizations to apply to the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) to receive title IV-E funds directly for foster care, adoption assistance, and, at Tribal option, for guardianship assistance programs. The Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe of Kingston, WA, was the first Tribe to have an approved title IV-E plan in 2012, followed by the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Pablo, MT, in March 2013. In December 2013, the Children's Bureau approved the title IV-E plan for the South Puget Tribal Planning Agency of Shelton, WA, the first Tribal consortium to be approved to operate the title IV-E program directly. Additional Tribes are working to develop or finalize title IV-E plans, and the Children's Bureau looks forward to approving plans later in 2014. The law authorizing Tribes' direct participation in the title IV-E program also authorized grants of up to $300,000 for a 2-year budget period for Tribes interested in developing a title IV-E plan. These funds are awarded annually through a competitive grant application process. Tribes may use these funds to develop policies and procedures, cost allocation methodologies, begin to plan for data collection, or take other steps necessary to develop and submit an approvable title IV-E plan. Tribes interested in applying for a grant in fiscal year (FY) 2014 may wish to view the funding forecast that has been published here: http://www.acf.hhs.gov/hhsgrantsforecast/index.cfm?switch=grant.view&gff_grants_forecastInfoID=66879 ACF anticipates awarding grants to five Tribes in FY 2014 and will continue to make these grants available in future years. Each Tribe has the discretion to determine whether or when it wants to develop its own title IV-E program. States remain responsible for serving resident American Indian children who are not otherwise being served by an American Indian Tribe under an agreement with the State or under a direct title IV-E plan. The law explicitly permits Indian Tribes to continue existing title IV-E agreements with States and/or enter into new agreements with States to administer all or part of the title IV-E program on behalf of Indian children and to access title IV-E administration, training, and data collection resources. States are required to negotiate in good faith with Indian Tribes, Tribal consortia, and Tribal organizations seeking title IV-E Tribal/State agreements. The Children's Bureau encourages Tribes interested in the title IV-E program to contact their Regional Office to learn more and to discuss options for the Tribe's participation. Related Item Children's Bureau Express featured the Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe in the article "Tribe to Operate Child Welfare Services" (June 2012). - The Associate Commissioner's PageThe Associate Commissioner's Page The following is the first installment in the new Associate Commissioner's Page series, featuring a monthly message from JooYeun Chang, the Associate Commissioner of the Children's Bureau. Each message will focus on the current CBX Spotlight theme and highlight the Bureau's work on the topic. There are nearly 400,000 children in foster care in the United States and, while exact numbers are difficult to pinpoint, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth are disproportionately represented in foster care. Estimates are that LGBTQ youth make up 5 to 10 percent of the foster care population. The actual percentage of LGBTQ youth in care may be higher, because children and youth may fear coming out due to rejection, harassment, or abuse. The Children's Bureau is proud to support LGBTQ children and youth involved with child welfare through a range of activities, including raising public awareness and providing technical assistance, resource materials, and grants for LGBTQ-focused projects. In fiscal year 2010, we awarded a Permanency Innovations Initiative (PII) grant to the L.A. Gay & Lesbian Center to address barriers to permanency for LGBTQ children and youth through its RISE (Recognize Intervene Support Empower) Initiative. The initiative targets LGBTQ children and youth ages 7–16 who are currently in foster care in Los Angeles County, CA, including those who are gender nonconforming and gender-questioning. The target population also includes youth dually involved with the child welfare and juvenile justice systems. RISE consists of three interventions: A survey of youth ages 12 and older on safety and well-being issues that gathers information from LGBTQ youth in foster care in order to assess their characteristics and service needs - An outreach and relationship-building practice protocol that aims to create a supportive environment for youth, including LGBTQ competency training and coaching for staff - Care Coordination teams for children and youth ages 7–16 that adapt the wraparound approach to include LGBTQ-competent family search and engagement strategies that reduce the risk of rejection and discrimination - Personal stories from youth involved with RISE were featured on the 2013 National Foster Care Month website: https://www.childwelfare.gov/fostercaremonth/reallifestories/lgbtqyouth.cfm A grantee profile for RISE is available on the Administration for Children and Families website: http://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb/rise_grantee_profile.pdf (38 KB) Members of the Children's Bureau's Training and Technical Assistance (T&TA) Network offer a variety of resources for child welfare and related professionals who work with LGBTQ youth, in addition to materials for youth and for LGBTQ families interested in becoming foster or adoptive parents. A list of these resources is provided in the article "T&TA Network Resources on LGBTQ Issues" in this issue of Children's Bureau Express.The Children's Bureau remains committed to ensuring the safety, well-being, and permanence of all children in and transitioning out of foster care, regardless of his or her sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We hope that you will join us this month and focus on the unique needs of this population and take steps to ensure that LGBTQ youth are seen and receive appropriate services and support. - Training and Technical Assistance Update The Children's Bureau recently awarded $21.2 million in funding to continue its support of NCWWI's work from 2013 to 2018. We also highlight a new project that aims to share the stories of individuals and families who have experienced adoption in the United States, among other updates from T&TA Network members. NRCA's Adoption TapestryNRCA's Adoption Tapestry The National Resource Center on Adoption (NRCA) is developing a project to share the stories of individuals and families who have experienced adoption in the United States. The adoption experience varies greatly from family to family, and the Adoption Tapestry project aims to share these different perspectives from families across the entire nation. The project consists of unscripted audio stories told by people who have been adopted and their families in which they share their firsthand experiences with adoption and guardianship. The stories will be collected and displayed via a map of the United States on the project's dedicated webpage on NRCA's website. The goal is to have each State represented by a personal account of an adoption experience, and NCRA will continue adding audio clips to the map throughout the year. Through the Adoption Tapestry project, the NRCA hopes not only to share various perspectives on adoption and illustrate the diversity in adoption experiences, but also to foster community awareness of the importance of permanency, inform practice, and provide a place to raise up and preserve the voices of those touched by adoption. Visit the NRCA's Adoption Tapestry page often to hear new audio clips as they are added: http://www.nrcadoption.org/map/ If you would like to submit your audio story for consideration, visit the following link for additional information and instructions: - NCWWI Announces Continued CB FundingNCWWI Announces Continued CB Funding In 2013, the Children's Bureau awarded the National Child Welfare Workforce Institute (NCWWI) $21.2 million to continue its work on workforce development.

The Unique Needs of Infants and ToddlersThe Unique Needs of Infants and Toddlers Almost 200,000 children under the age of 3 come into contact with the child welfare system every year. Although young children are extremely vulnerable, the first years of life are a time when interventions can prevent and/or mitigate the negative effects of child maltreatment. A recent report from Child Trends and ZERO TO THREE suggests that high-quality, timely interventions focused on the unique needs of young children can significantly reduce the developmental damage to infants and toddlers who have been maltreated. The report details findings from a survey of 46 State child welfare agency representatives. The goal was to identify innovative policies and practices, as well as key challenges, gaps, and barriers that agencies face in meeting the needs of infants and toddlers who experience maltreatment. Results indicate that most States have policies and practices to promote the health and well-being of all children who have been maltreated; however, there is often no distinction for the unique developmental needs of infants and toddlers. In addition, results show that States are not fully addressing the needs of birth parents. The report indicates that States need, and some already have, policies that include more frequent visitation with birth parents; rapid screenings and services for health and developmental concerns; involvement of birth parents in services for their young children; services for birth parents; more frequent case reviews, court hearings, and caseworker visits; and specific training for child welfare staff on developmentally appropriate practices for infants and toddlers. The report includes several links to resources that may assist States. Changing the Course for Infants and Toddlers: A Survey of State Child Welfare Policies and Initiatives is available on the Child Trend website: http://www.childtrends.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/changing-the-course-for-infants-and-toddlers-FINAL.pdf (5 MB) - Helping Young Children SucceedHelping Young Children Succeed The Annie E. Casey Foundation recently published a new KIDS COUNT Policy Report addressing the importance of investing in the earliest years of child development. A child's first 8 years are especially critical for fostering the cognitive, social, and emotional skills, as well as the good physical health, that lay the foundation for positive growth at later ages. The report calls for an integrated and comprehensive system of services that meets the needs of all U.S. children between birth and 8 years of age, as well as their families. An effective early childhood system should integrate a wide variety of evidence-based programs that have demonstrated positive outcomes for families with young children. In order to meet the needs of all of the country's children, systems should focus on three primary goals: Supporting parents who are caring for their children - Increasing child and family access to quality early care and education, health care, and other services - Ensuring that care is comprehensive and coordinated for all children between birth and 8 years of age - The full report further outlines specific strategies that fall under each of the three main goals and concludes by emphasizing the need for stakeholders to invest in early childhood development to prevent the need to address issues that arise later on in life. Furthermore, policymakers at the Federal, State, and local levels should inform their legislative efforts using evidence from best practices within the early childhood education and development fields. The First Eight Years: Giving Kids a Foundation for Lifetime Success, along with other KIDS COUNT data and research reports, is available on the Annie E. Casey Foundation website: http://www.aecf.org/KnowledgeCenter/Publications.aspx?pubguid=%7bC1FB5F12-3394-4F79-9BF7-549F73DC7CA6%7d - Risk Factors for Female Crossover YouthRisk Factors for Female Crossover Youth An April 2013 issue brief by Advocates for Children and Youth (ACY) provides an overview of existing research, the unique risk factors of, and the trends associated with teen girls involved with the child welfare and juvenile justice systems in Maryland. Youth involved with both child welfare and juvenile justice face myriad challenges, which generally require more intensive services than youth involved in a single system. However, these youth often do not receive the coordinated services and support they need because of the inherent barriers associated with cross-agency collaboration. Of these youth, a disproportionately large number are female, specifically women of color, yet little research exists to examine this phenomenon. The ACY brief outlines some of the risk factors shown to make females more susceptible to involvement with both the child welfare and juvenile justice systems, including age at the time of abuse, out-of-home placement, environmental and social instability, and a history of trauma and maltreatment. It also summarizes the legislation that the Maryland General Assembly passed in 2011 that looks at gender disparities in services offered by Maryland's Department of Juvenile Services. While the resulting report focused on youth involved with juvenile justice, many trends can be applied to crossover youth. Some of these trends and a number of other key points, including demographics/data are presented. ACY is a nonprofit, Maryland-based advocacy organization whose mission is to promote and evaluate the effectiveness of policies and programs that work to ensure that all Maryland children are safe, healthy, educated, and secure in their families and communities. Unique Risk Factors Signal Dual Involvement for Female Youth in Child Welfare and Juvenile Justice Systems: More Research Needed to Better Serve Population, 10(4), the first of several related briefs, is available on the ACY website: http://www.acy.org/upimages/Issue_Brief_Draft_Crossover_Girls_almost_FINAL.pdf (355 KB) - Serving Young Children With Special NeedsServing Young Children With Special Needs Even with thousands of children receiving early intervention and special education services in Missouri, many children and families in the State are underserved. To better meet their needs, the Community Partnership—an organization that works to match public and private funding, resources, and programs to achieve better results for children, families, and communities—established the Capable Kids and Families program (CKF). A new report from Chapin Hall provides evaluation data from the program's second year. The program, which focuses on children birth to 6 years, has three primary components: Home visiting. Specialists visit with families to offer developmental activities, discuss family needs and provide referrals, and coordinate therapy equipment needs. These visits also are intended to help decrease isolation and stress, boost confidence, and increase awareness of other resources. - Therapy equipment loans. CKF has purchased more than 1,700 pieces of therapy equipment, including books, tapes, and toys, that families can borrow free of charge. Equipment is available to address a wide range of developmental areas, such as gross and fine motor skills, speech and language, and sensory integration. This helps families to continue therapeutic activities throughout the week and not only during therapy sessions. - Supportive group meetings and activities. CKF encourages socialization among the families to promote resource sharing and peer support, which can help parents discuss issues, learn new skills, and alleviate feelings of isolation. The program also has inclusive playgroups that provide experiences for children of all abilities. - In 2011, the Community Partnership contracted Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago to evaluate CKF. The evaluation included a comparison group of families receiving services from programs other than CKF and utilized a mail survey and focus groups to collect data. There were few differences between the CKF service recipients and the comparison group in terms of their experiences and satisfaction with services. CKF families, however, used therapeutic services more frequently than the comparison group, but this could be related to the fact that children receiving CKF services had more (and more severe) disabilities or diagnoses. CKF families also had higher rates of satisfaction with their relationships with service professionals than the comparison families. Another benefit of the CKF program that emerged from the focus groups was that the CKF program includes all family members when teaching families how to incorporate therapeutic activities into regular routines as opposed to other programs, which may only include some family members. Focus group participants receiving CKF services also found the monthly playgroups and other group activities to be very helpful and supportive.

The Conrad N. Hilton Foundation recently released a report, California's Most Vulnerable Parents: When Maltreated Children Have Children, that uses linkages between CPS and birth records to provide additional analysis and understanding of teen birth rates among youth currently or formerly involved with CPS in Los Angeles County. The study was conducted by the University of Southern California in collaboration with the California Child Welfare Indicators Project at the University of California at Berkeley and the California Department of Social Services. The following are some of the key findings from the study: Teen girls in foster care have a significantly higher rate of teen childbearing than girls in the general population of Los Angeles County. - Among teen girls who gave birth, more than 40 percent had been reported as maltreatment victims prior to conception, and 20 percent had confirmed or substantiated allegations. - Among girls who had been in foster care at age 17, more than 25 percent had given birth at least once before age 20. - By age 5, children who were born to teen mothers who had been maltreated were more than twice as likely to be victims as other children. - To view the full report, visit: http://www.hiltonfoundation.org/images/stories/PriorityAreas/FosterYouth/Downloads/Vulnerable_Parents_Full_Report_11-11-13.pdf (1,700 KB) - Strategies and Tools for Practice This section of CBX offers publications, articles, reports, toolkits, and other instruments that provide either evidence-based strategies or other concrete help to child welfare and related professionals. This month, we include a factsheet on young children's participation in and access to high-quality early care and education, trends in Federal and State investments in these programs, and more. The Benefits of Trauma-Informed CareThe Benefits of Trauma-Informed Care Children who have been placed in care because of abuse or neglect likely experience further trauma after entering the system, including separation from family, friends, and community, as well as the uncertainty of their future. A publication published by the State Policy Advocacy and Reform Center (SPARC) discusses the consequences that these multiple sources of trauma and stress can have on the long-term physical, social, and emotional well-being of these children and how trauma-informed care can lead to better outcomes. Authors Eva Klain and Amanda White, from the American Bar Association's Center on Children and the Law, summarize research on the effects of trauma on children in foster care and the benefits of trauma-informed interventions and treatments. They also describe a number of promising evidence-based therapies that help children learn coping skills, manage trauma-induced responses, and form healthy relationships. The authors also point to models of trauma-informed practices for child welfare agencies, the juvenile courts system, and legal representatives. For each model, links to more detailed information are provided. The authors conclude by presenting five trauma-informed practice recommendations, including: Educating stakeholders about the effects of trauma on children and families - Ensuring that children entering the child welfare system are screened and assessed for trauma - Referring children to appropriate evidence-based, trauma-specific treatments - Providing information and trauma-related services to families and caregivers - Engaging stakeholders in the recovery process - Implementing Trauma-Informed Practices in Child Welfare was published by SPARC, an initiative funded by the Annie E. Casey Foundation and Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative, and is available from the SPARC website: http://childwelfaresparc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Implementing-Trauma-Informed-Practices.pdf (276 KB) - Transitioning Youth With DisabilitiesTransitioning Youth With Disabilities Youth with disabilities face additional challenges as they transition from the child welfare system to independent living. Compared to their peers, this population is at increased risk for poor outcomes and need high-quality programs and services to help them live independently and safely. Three guides from the Juvenile Law Center are designed to provide professionals with a framework for supporting youth with disabilities and are transitioning out of care. A Guide for Professionals for Youth with Disabilities Transition Planning focuses on the following key topics:Available treatment services and resources for youth in the child welfare system - Strategies to improve access to health care benefits and programs that match youth needs - Requirements under State and Federal laws and eligibility criteria - Planning Tool and Protocol for Transition Planning for Youth with Disabilities from the Child Welfare System to Adulthood is structured as a companion to the Professional guide and outlines specific action steps for child welfare workers, including: Optimizing the transition process - Youth engagement in decision-making - Health care and financial assistance - Transition Planning for Youth with Disabilities in the Child Welfare System: A Guide for Youth offers an overview of the transition planning process. Each section explores a range of topics, including: Family and permanency options - Obtaining Independent Living services - Meeting health care, educational, and housing needs - Accessing supplementary security income before and after transition - The series of guides is available on the Juvenile Law Center website: http://www.jlc.org/current-initiatives/improving-outcomes-court-involved-youth/permanency-and-transition-adulthood/tran - Getting Youth Engaged in Their CommunityGetting Youth Engaged in Their Community Portland State University's Research and Training Center for Pathways to Positive Futures recently published a guide for community implementation of the Photovoice program. Photovoice encourages young people to get involved in their communities by giving them the opportunity to serve as neighborhood experts. Experts use cameras to document the realities of their day-to-day lives, enabling them to highlight various strengths and challenges within their communities. Photographs are then used to spark small-group discussions with policymakers, community leaders, and power brokers within the area to promote and initiate positive neighborhood change. The program guide was developed based on lessons learned while implementing Photovoice with urban American Indian/Alaska Native youth receiving culturally and community-based services at the Native American Youth and Family Center. The guide provides helpful strategies for implementation, as well as knowledge gained from the experiences of the researchers and youth. The guide provides specific strategies for the following: How to prepare stakeholders for implementing Photovoice within their communities - The materials necessary for Photovoice implementation - Strategies for engaging youth in discussions among themselves and with community leaders in order to effect change - The ethics issues that need to be reviewed by youth - Additional readings and resources for understanding the principles and concepts behind Photovoice - I Bloomed Here: A Guide for Conducting Photovoice With Youth Receiving Culturally- and Community-Based Services is available here: http://pathwaysrtc.pdx.edu/pdf/proj5-photovoice.pdf (358 KB) - Marriage and Relationship EducationMarriage and Relationship Education In recent years, relationship education has been regarded as an effective tool for teaching the skills that foster healthy relationships and strengthen marriages. A new publication from the National Healthy Marriage Resource Center (NHMRC) provides practical guidance to organizations wishing to develop effective relationship education programs in their communities. The manual, Marriage and Relationship Education (MRE) Program Development and Management Manual, integrates and expands upon resources created by NHMRC in the course of its work with federally funded healthy marriage grantees, as well as incorporating tools and strategies suggested by those working in the MRE field. The goal of the manual is to support the work of social service providers in delivering MRE through providing how-to guidance on developing MRE programs on building capacity; budgeting and funding; curriculum development; workshop logistics; program management; building public awareness; recruitment, enrollment, and retention of participants; and evaluation. Addenda include a glossary of terms; a list of online resources; and reproducible worksheets for use in programs, including tools for assessment and budgeting and a sample press release. The National Healthy Marriage Resource Center (NHMRC) is a clearinghouse for information, resources, and training on healthy marriage for researchers, policymakers, media, marriage educators, couples and individuals, and program providers. Initial funding for this project was provided by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Administration for Children and Families. Hard copies of the manual are available for purchase from NHMRC, or it is available as a downloadable PDF document: http://www.healthymarriageinfo.org/resource-detail/index.aspx?rid=4025 - Resources This CBX section provides a quick list of interesting resources, such as websites, videos, journals, funding or scholarship opportunities, or other materials that can be used in the field or with families. This month, we point to a guide on how to start a youth-serving program and bilingual resources for refugee or immigrant children and teens. Safety Guides for Refugee, Immigrant ChildrenSafety Guides for Refugee, Immigrant Children Bridging Refugee Youth and Children's Services (BRYCS), a project of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), produced two bilingual safety guides: one for refugee and immigrant children, and another that speaks to older youth. Intended to build self-esteem, reinforce positive behaviors, and develop awareness and boundaries for children and teens, each guide addresses the challenges facing each age group with respect to cultural assimilation, socialization with peers, and relationships with adults. The guides are available on the BRYCS website: Keeping Safe! A Teen Bilingual Guide (Cuídense! Una Guía Bilingüe para Jóvenes): http://brycs.org/documents/upload/teens-bilingual-safety-guide.pdf (4 MB) Keeping Safe! Children's Bilingual Guide (Cuídense! Una Guía Bilingüe para Niños): http://brycs.org/documents/upload/childrens-bilingual-safety-guide.pdf (4 MB) - Starting a Youth-Serving ProgramStarting a Youth-Serving Program The National Clearinghouse on Families and Youth produced an online guide for adults or other youth who want to start a youth-serving program. The guide is divided into four parts, each with a series of videos featuring "Tamara," a youth and family services professional, and other downloadable tools. Define Your Niche walks users through identifying a problem to solve, how to help, and long-term goals for the program. - Conceive Your Vision and Mission provides information on why every program needs a mission and vision statement and how to write these statements. - Bring Your Nonprofit Into Being outlines the process for creating a nonprofit, building a board, and filing for tax exempt status. - Plan Your Programs addresses the kinds of programming the youth-serving nonprofit will offer and financing. - The National Clearinghouse on Families and Youth is a free information service of the Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB). Its purpose is to educate the family and youth work field—including FYSB grantees and aspiring grantees—about the research and effective practices that can improve the long-term social and emotional wellbeing of families and youth. The Start a Youth Program guide is available on its website: - Early Care, Education FactsheetEarly Care, Education Factsheet Approximately 25 percent of children in the United States under the age of 6 live in poverty and 12 percent live in extreme poverty. These children often have limited early learning experiences, which can cause educational failure and other negative outcomes later in life. The Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP) and the National Center for Children in Poverty (NCCP) collaborated to produce a factsheet on young children's participation in and access to high-quality early care and education. The factsheet outlines information about the percentages of young children with poor educational outcomes, trends in Federal and State investments in early care and education programs, and State policies that either affect or support both access to and the quality of these programs. Additional resources from CLASP and the NCCP also are provided. Investing in Young Children: A Factsheet on Early Care and Education Participation, Access, and Quality is available on the CLASP website: http://www.clasp.org/resources-and-publications/publication-1/Investing-in-Young-Children.pdf (874 KB) - Guide for Grandparents Raising GrandchildrenGuide for Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Grandparents and other kinship caregivers face unique challenges and have specific needs. In 1994, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Elder Affairs, in collaboration with the Executive Office of Health and Human Services, produced a guide that identified needed programs, services, and other resources and information to help grandparents raising their grandchildren. In July 2008, the State Child Advocate bill was signed into law and established the Commission on the Status of Grandparents Raising Grandchildren. This Commission is actively working to better understand and address the needs of grandparents in this situation, and this updated guide is just one result of those efforts. The guide is divided into 11 chapters, including Getting Started: What to Consider, Care and Custody Basics, and Financial Issues, Child Support and Public Assistance. A Resource Guide for Massachusetts' Grandparents Raising their Grandchildren, a collaborative effort by the Commission on the Status of Grandparents Raising Grandchildren, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Elder Affairs, the Massachusetts Office of the Child Advocate, the Department of Children and Families, and the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services, is available here: http://www.mass.gov/elders/docs/caregiver/grandparents-raising-grandchildren.pdf (411 KB) - Training and Conferences Find trainings, workshops, webinars, and other opportunities for professionals and families to learn about how to improve the lives of children and youth as well as a listing of upcoming events and conferences.

Vol. 23, No. 6—Spotlight on LGBTQ+ Youth Involved With Child Welfare [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://cbexpress.acf.hhs.gov/previous_issues/8880b6e51be01550bca18512f54bcbcc)

> July/August 2022Vol. 23, No. 6Spotlight on LGBTQ+ Youth Involved With Child Welfare This edition of CBX features resources centered on youth who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, or other diverse identity (LGBTQ+) and are involved with child welfare, the challenges they face, and how to support them. Read a message from Associate Commissioner Aysha E. Schomburg about the importance of fighting for our individual freedom. We also feature a special article in the News From the Children's Bureau section by a child advocate about his experiences in a Ukrainian orphanage and the obstacles facing Ukrainian children and youth waiting to be adopted. This issue also includes valuable resources for professionals and the families they serve. Issue Spotlight What Is Known About the LGBTQ Perspective in Child Welfare ServicesWhat Is Known About the LGBTQ Perspective in Child Welfare Services Although youth who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning (LGBTQ) are overrepresented in out-of-home care, there is a lack of research on LGBTQ perspectives on child welfare services. The journal Child and Family Social Work published a scoping review examining existing research on child welfare services for LGBTQ youth, their caregivers, and foster parents. The researchers used the following two questions to guide their research: What is known about the practices of child welfare services toward LGBTQ youth and caregivers? - What is known about LGBTQ foster parents? - The studies in the review were classified using three main themes:The experiences, prevalence, and outcomes of LGBTQ youth who come into contact with child welfare - The perspectives of LGBTQ foster parents and foster caregivers of youth in care who are LGBTQ - Child welfare practice in an LGBTQ perspective - The article summarizes the findings from the reviewed studies and how they relate to the identified themes. It also identifies gaps in the literature, such as the studies being predominantly conducted in more accepting countries and consisting of qualitative interview studies. These findings can guide the planning and commissioning of future research and practice, including identifying areas where change can be seen and good practices have been identified as well as areas for improvement. - Discriminatory Transgender Health Bills Have Critical Consequences for YouthDiscriminatory Transgender Health Bills Have Critical Consequences for Youth Child Trends published a brief that provides the context, definitions, and benefits of gender-affirming care as well as how anti-LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and/or questioning) health policies harm LGBTQ+ youth. Young people are increasingly expressing gender identities that are different than the genders they were assigned at birth. At the same time, several states are passing discriminatory laws that deny access to gender-affirming care or criminalizing adults that facilitate it. Having access to gender-affirming care has been proven to be beneficial, while preventing access leads to poor mental and physical health outcomes. Gender-affirming care is developmentally dependent and appropriate and can include name, pronoun, and identification card changes. For older adolescents, it may include, after careful consideration, puberty blockers and supportive hormone therapy. When transgender youth are supported in their identities, they have outcomes–including for mental health and academics—more in line with their cisgender peers. When health care aimed at LGBTQ+ youth is made inaccessible or criminalized, it can increase youth's overall risk of experiencing violence and poorer health outcomes. The brief also provides recommendations that policymakers can use to create gender-affirming policies. Child welfare and related professionals on all levels should recognize the importance of gender-affirming care and understand that it is a necessary, medically indicated treatment. Policies should focus on ensuring and protecting transgender youth's access to gender-affirming care. For full definitions, recommendations, and resources, read Discriminatory Transgender Health Bills Have Critical Consequences for Youth. - System Involvement Among LBQ Girls and WomenSystem Involvement Among LBQ Girls and Women The Williams Institute at the University of California School of Law released a factsheet that examines disproportionality in the foster care and criminal justice systems for lesbian, bisexual, and queer (LBQ) girls and women. The factsheet reviews data from multiple studies. The research shows that more than four times as many LBQ girls (cisgender and transgender) in foster care are American Indian or Black than in the general population of sexual minority girls. Research also shows that the percentage of incarcerated girls and women who are LBQ is between 3 and 10 times higher, respectively, than the proportion of LBQ girls and women in the general population and that the majority of LBQ girls and women who are incarcerated are people of color. The factsheet noted that there are not sufficient population-level data to create accurate estimates of the transgender girl and women population in the criminal justice system. The authors note how dual-involved youth require tailored services that address the intersectionality of race, gender, and sexual orientation and that more research and policy attention should be focused on this population. To see the full discussion as well as graphs, methodologies, and more, read the factsheet, System Involvement Among LBQ Girls and Women. - The Crux of Individual FreedomThe Crux of Individual Freedom Written by Associate Commissioner Aysha E. Schomburg We entered the month of June in full celebration mode. All around the country, we acknowledged and celebrated Juneteenth, the commemoration of the emancipation of the last remaining enslaved African Americans in this country. This was only the first anniversary of Juneteenth as a federal holiday; as old as Juneteenth is for the African American community, its observance by this nation is still new. Juneteenth is all about freedom. We also celebrated LGBTQI+ Pride. June is our annual opportunity to embrace our LGBTQI+ and gender nonconforming identities and our allyship with the LGBTQI+ community. There were rainbows everywhere! Pride was born out of agitation and a refusal to concede. Pride is all about freedom. We entered June with maximum joy. It found us living but left us longing. The crux of individual freedom is that in this country, we live freely, publicly, but only as long as we have been given the permission to do so. We have to fight hard for each of our freedoms; historically, for some of us, they are parceled out piece by piece. The battles are on record. Individual freedom most certainly is not free. Toward the end of the month, we were reminded about the fragility of our individual freedom. On the same day that the Senate passed gun control legislation intended to keep our society safer, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) struck down a century-old New York law, which required gun seekers to show "proper cause" for carrying a gun outside of the home. The law was intended to keep residents safer. SCOTUS cited the constitutional right to bear arms and opined that this freedom should be enjoyed without interference. Many argue the constitutional right to bear arms is about individual freedom, while others ask, "What about my freedom to live life safely and free from gun violence?" Individual freedom is multifaceted and complex. A few days later, SCOTUS struck down Roe vs. Wade, a law that gave pregnant people the right to seek abortion health care. This is also about individual freedom—the freedom to choose or not choose to become a parent. Battles were fought and won 50 years ago to achieve that freedom. SCOTUS demonstrated swiftly that the individual freedom we may enjoy today, with permission, can be seized overnight. In this country of over 330 million, 5 people aptly exhibited their power to destroy an individual freedom. The crux of individual freedom is that it is not fixed, and it is not free. Individual freedom is complex. We may have different ideas about what freedom is and how it should manifest. Your individual freedom might make me feel unsafe. My individual freedom may run contrary to your personal sensibilities. In this country, we have the right to fight for our individual freedom. The stakes are high so the battles will be fought, because the pursuit of individual freedom is the pearl in the oyster. Freedom is at the core of it all, for each of us. - Proceedings From a Workshop on Reducing Inequalities for LGBTQ AdolescentsProceedings From a Workshop on Reducing Inequalities for LGBTQ Adolescents The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Board on Children, Youth, and Families held a workshop called "Reducing Inequalities Between LGBTQ Adolescents and Cisgender, Heterosexual Adolescents" to better understand the inequalities facing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) youth as well as explore promising interventions to address them. The workshop's planning committee, which included experts from the fields of sociology, medicine, public health, psychology, social work, policy, and direct-service provision, sought input from professionals and practitioners whose daily and lived experience is in the service of LGBTQ adolescents as well as from LGBTQ youth of color about their perspectives, lives, and recommendations. The document acknowledges and addresses the intersectional nature of LGBTQ youth's lives, which means that each individual has multiple overlapping and interacting identities that include their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and abilities, which all affect their experiences within society. The published proceedings of the workshop detail outcomes and interventions for LGBTQ youth as well as interventions for personal, justice, and care systems; for families and communities; regarding mental, emotional, and physical health; and in education. The percentage of the population who identifies as LGBTQ has risen, and, within each racial and ethnic group, 17 to 31 percent of youth identify as LGBTQ. Research has not kept pace with the increase, nor has it generally been inclusive and racially or culturally sensitive. The document notes that researchers and policymakers can improve their work by asking themselves who they have failed to include throughout the process and by examining if they are approaching populations with a holistic mindset—that is, that the population is multifaceted and includes unique needs from multiple demographics. It is critical to consider how policies will benefit or disadvantage different LGBTQ youth depending on their racial or ethnic backgrounds and their involvement in any other systems. Explore the proceedings to learn more about intersectionality and LGBTQ youth as well as detailed examples of interventions to help support LGBTQ youth. - October 2024 Spotlight on Intersection of Child Welfare and Family Violence September 2024 Spotlight on Kinship Care Recent Issues News From the Children's Bureau In this section, find the latest news, resources, and publications from the Administration for Children and Families, the Children's Bureau, and other offices within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as well as a listing of the latest additions to the Children's Bureau website. Information Memorandum Provides Guidance for Title IV-B and IV-E Agencies Serving LGBTQI+ Children and YouthInformation Memorandum Provides Guidance for Title IV-B and IV-E Agencies Serving LGBTQI+ Children and Youth Many youth involved with child welfare who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, or intersex (LGBTQI+) face additional challenges compared with their peers who do not, making them more vulnerable to negative outcomes. LGBTQI+ youth often have to endure family rejection, neglect, exploitation, and hostility. Transgender youth can face the additional stress of being denied access to affirming medical care, sometimes as a result of intentional systemic barriers. The Children's Bureau released an Information Memorandum (IM) to provide guidance to title IV-B and IV-E agencies about the way they serve LGBTQI+ children and youth involved with child welfare. The IM also provides information to agencies about the provisions in titles IV-B and IV-E that can be used to help guide their work in creating plans and providing services to LGBTQI+ youth in care. Read the IM to learn more. - Child Advocate Speaks About Ukrainian Orphanage Experience and the Future for OrphansChild Advocate Speaks About Ukrainian Orphanage Experience and the Future for Orphans Written by Ryan Young, at the invitation of Associate Commissioner Aysha E. Schomburg Many people worldwide are extending their humanitarian support and solidarity toward the unwarranted Russian war in Ukraine; however, the plight of Ukrainian orphans is often unintentionally overlooked. According to Save the Children, there are more than 100,000 orphan children living in 600 Ukrainian orphanages. The U.S. State Department recently declared a travel ban on U.S. citizens traveling to Ukraine due to the ongoing Russian war. As a result, many prospective adoptive parents hoping to adopt Ukrainian children are not able to proceed with the adoption process. I was once an orphan who lived in a Ukrainian orphanage. Here's my story and the effects that the ongoing war in Ukraine can have on the safety of orphans. I was born into a loving biological family that was circumstantially extremely poor. As a result, they had to cooperate with Ukrainian officials to remove my older birth brother and myself to be placed in a Ukrainian orphanage. After 7 years, a single, Argentinian American mother from the United States sought to adopt a child from Ukraine, and my time as a Ukrainian orphan was over. The adoption was finalized in May of 2008. Coinciding with the finalization of my adoption, former Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko changed Ukrainian international adoption laws to prevent single people from adopting Ukrainian orphans. My brother and I were the last Ukrainian orphans adopted by a single parent. I continue to be grateful for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be adopted. After coming to the United States, I spent 5 years in a private boarding school and ended up in the foster care system in Arizona at the age of 16, later aging out of the system at 18. I could not imagine being an orphan in Ukraine right now, and I am hopeful they are safe and protected from this war's life-threatening harm. Many orphans in Ukraine rely on their government to preserve their safety, but how can a government do that when their top priorities revolve around restoring their peoples' freedoms and livelihood? There are current humanitarian efforts under way to ensure the orphans' safety, but I have to question how successful they will be if the Russian attacks continue to have a deadly effect in Ukraine. These orphan children shouldn't be in the midst of this war nor be put on the backburner. The Ukrainian orphans deserve safety, stability, and permanency above all, and our American foster care system has not been great at that. However, if we continue to focus on these priorities, all children can thrive even amidst deadly crises. Their lives are just as important as the rest of the people in Ukraine. I am hopeful that the Ukrainian government, along with humanitarian support, will fiercely continue to ensure their safety at such a challenging time like this. - CB Website UpdatesCB Website Updates The Children's Bureau website hosts information on child welfare programs, funding, monitoring, training and technical assistance, laws, statistics, research, federal reporting, and much more.

These beneficial relationships are in part created through coregulation. Coregulation is when adults enact three types of support with youth: caring, consistent, and responsive relationships; cocreation of supportive environments; and intentional and developmentally informed day-to-day interactions. The Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation within the Administration for Children and Families of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released a series of guides that define the different components of coregulation and how it can be applied to youth in foster care. The guides are intended for adults who regularly interact with youth in foster care. There are four guides in the series (one each for caring adults, child welfare professionals, foster families, and kinship caregivers). Each guide provides information about what coregulation entails and why it is important, ways adults can foster coregulation in their relationships with youth, examples of conversations that support coregulation, and specific ways caring adults, child welfare professionals, foster families, and kinship caregivers can strengthen their capacity for coregulation. Read the following guides to learn more about coregulation and how it can improve well-being and support the development of children and youth in foster care: Caring Adults Guide: How to Support Older Youth With Foster Care Experience Through Co-Regulation - Child Welfare Professionals Guide: How to Support Older Youth With Foster Care Experience Through Co-Regulation - Foster Families Guide: How to Support Older Youth With Foster Care Experience Through Co-Regulation - Kinship Caregivers Guide: How to Support Older Youth With Foster Care Experience Through Co-Regulation - - Training and Technical Assistance Updates This section features resources and updates from the Children's Bureau's technical assistance partners to support practices and systems that improve the lives of children and families. NTDC Expands Parenting Paradigm to Help Foster, Kinship, and Adoptive Parents Better Understand Healthy Sexual Development and IdentityNTDC Expands Parenting Paradigm to Help Foster, Kinship, and Adoptive Parents Better Understand Healthy Sexual Development and Identity Written By April Dinwoodie The National Training and Development Curriculum for Foster and Adoptive Parents (NTDC) is a modern educational approach to engaging and educating prospective and current foster, kinship, and adoptive parents. Available in June 2022, NTDC—which is informed by research and highlights the voices of parents, professionals, and youth—offers transformational, multimedia training experiences to help families understand their role in caring for children and build new and necessary parenting skills that ultimately expand the parenting paradigm.Supporting the healthy sexual development and identity of youth requires parents and professionals to learn, grow, and continually expand their understanding of sexuality and relationships in nonjudgmental ways. Taking this to heart, the NTDC team has created specific content and tools for parents that address these foundational elements.Within the comprehensive curriculum, NTDC's right-time training (RTT) provides ongoing learning and skills development for participants by offering additional themes that are not covered in the classroom-based training. RTT is applicable to parents who are fostering or adopting children they are not related to, kinship caregivers, foster and adoptive parents who are American Indian/Alaska Native, and parents who have adopted privately domestically or via the intercountry process.Specifically, RTT includes tools, such as mini-podcasts, videos, and written content that provide an overview of healthy sexual development and how to talk to children about their sexual development and relationships. The tools address some of the needs children who have experienced trauma, loss, or separation may have in developing a positive, healthy identity relative to their sexuality, sexual orientation, and gender identity and expression. They also provide strategies for parents to use in supporting this development.Informed by professionals and those with lived experience, the Healthy Sexual Development and Identity RTT helps parents and caregivers to do the following:Understand and build awareness of definitions and language - Become familiar with the differences between sex and gender, gender expression and gender identity, and sexual orientation and gender - Know how to help children and teenagers develop strategies to handle bias and discrimination - Understand nonbinary gender identities - Help teenagers understand healthy sexual relationships - The My Story Mini Podcast series is a signature learning tool that delivers short-form audio content that busy parents can access when they need it. One of the most powerful episodes in the series features Jarel Melendez, a youth formerly in foster care who had to navigate healthy sexual identity and sexual development coupled with the challenges of family separation and moves from state to state. You can listen to the full episode here.For more information about the NTDC, contact Sue Cohick at scohick@spaulding.org. - Change and Implementation in Practice: Overview VideoChange and Implementation in Practice: Overview Video The Capacity Building Center for States has a video that provides an overview of its Change and Implementation in Practice series of resources. The video provides information on how agencies that are seeking to implement new programs, services, and strategies to effect change and better outcomes for the children, youth, and families they serve can benefit from a structured approach to exploring the challenges associated with this task. The animated, 7-minute video presents two potential paths agencies can take when selecting and implementing a new program. On one path, agencies can quicky forge ahead with new and promising programs and services without first considering whether they will address specific problems or be a good fit for the families involved with the agency, which can lead to misspent resources, frustrated staff, and failure to meet the needs of children and families. Agencies can also choose a structured change and implementation path that uses data, evidence, and teamwork to understand the needs of families and find the right strategies to produce positive outcomes for them. On this path, agencies can plan and prepare to implement solutions as well as evaluate them through the course of their implementation to ensure they are a good fit. The video also discusses the following eight strategies that lead to effective change and implementation: Teaming - Assessing readiness - Problem exploration - Theory of change - Intervention selection and design/adaptation - Implementation planning and capacity building - Intervention testing, piloting, and staging - Monitoring, evaluating, and applying findings - You can view the video, as well as the Change in Implementation in Practice suite, on the Capacity Building Center for States website. - Updates From the Children's Bureau's Training and Technical Assistance PartnersUpdates From the Children's Bureau's Training and Technical Assistance Partners The Children's Bureau funds several technical assistance centers to provide professionals with tools to better serve children, youth, and families.

As agencies launch these change initiatives and incorporate youth and young adults into the decision-making process, what are the lessons learned, opportunities, wins, and challenges? Youth advisory boards (YABs) can play an essential role in informing the development and enhancement of child welfare policies and practices. The Louisiana YAB (also known as LEAF) was redesigned in 2019 to become more youth led and informed. Antonica Frazier, chairperson of LEAF's policy committee, engaged in brainstorming policy-related opportunities with other youth and young adults. The team included adult supporters, like Christy Tate, who was at the time a child welfare manager 2 and oversaw transitioning youth and the state's extended foster care program. Christy partnered with the YAB to inform, guide, and support a foster youth bill of rights and, ultimately, the legislation development effort.The team researched existing bills of rights and reviewed current policies of the Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services. Using the research and their lived experiences, the YAB created a multipage document highlighting the rights of young people across various topics, including placement, religion, familial rights, and the right to be more informed about their placement and care plans. The idea arose to formalize these rights through legislation, and with the support of Christy and her experience working and advocating with the state legislature, the Louisiana Foster Youth Bill of Rights became law. We asked Antonica and Christy about their engagement with each other, what productive engagement looks like, their lessons learned, and the advice they have for the field.When reflecting on the value of youth engagement in child welfare, Antonica said, "I engage with child welfare agencies to help improve the livelihoods for youth and young adults, to advocate for their rights as individuals...and to help increase youth voice." Christy added, "Engagement is a necessary component of a successful system. There is no better person to help you understand the needs of a service or system than those who have lived within it."Partnerships are critical because they empower young people to be the driver in shaping their lives and directing their futures. As Antonica notes, collaboration can also "bring youthful perspectives and ideas to the table." However, like with any relationship, there are challenges to overcome. From the agency perspective, it can feel difficult to capture those youthful perspectives at the right moment in time. According to Christy:"I think one of the biggest challenges is that youth, due to their age, are not always available long term. This is a stage of their life that will not last forever. The key is to ensure you have strong youth and staff working together to develop other youth along the way. Sometimes when people come and go, momentum can be lost, but if you have other strong youth involved, you can always keep moving forward."For those looking to launch or enhance their youth engagement initiatives, the partners from Louisiana had some advice. Antonica provided insight for youth involved in the building process, saying, "It is okay to be nervous and have some fears. This is a new relationship…and will take time to get better. Some of the partnerships will lead to making a difference for youth and young adults in child welfare, which is the reason why we do this work."Christy added the staff perspective to Antonica's advice, suggesting that agency staff should "be authentic and put time into it. Start with an open slate and be prepared to really listen and hear all their stories and all their needs. From there, find some quick and easy things to partner [on] for success so that everyone can see you are there to support their work and that you are committed to the success of their work. Also, compensate them for their time, their lived experience, and partnering to improve the system."Effective youth engagement calls for deliberate practice improvements. According to Antonica and Christy, the following are some strategies that child welfare staff and young adult advocates can use to encourage the formation of authentic partnerships:Pulling teams together in group settings on a regular basis and dedicating the time to engage in deep planning - Building relationships and getting to know one another by creating space for team building and free time to eat, laugh, and talk - Celebrating the small, early successes that are critical for the vision and partnership and that reinforce the importance of the work - Coming to the work with a positive attitude and a passion for empowering youth and young adults - Sharing a joint mindset and goal for making a difference in the agency - Division X Technical Assistance is funded by the Children's Bureau to partner with public child welfare agencies and enhance their youth engagement programs and initiatives. More information is available on the Division X Technical Assistance webpage. - Child Welfare Research In this section, we highlight recent studies, literature reviews, and other research on child welfare topics. Brief Explores Drug Testing in the Child Welfare SystemBrief Explores Drug Testing in the Child Welfare System A recent brief from the National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare (NCSACW) provides guidance to child welfare agencies for developing policy and practice protocols related to the use of drug testing. The brief, which is the first of a two-part series on the topic, covers four steps: Determine the purpose of drug testing - Determine whom to test and when - Determine a method of testing - Determine a budget for testing - The brief notes that drug testing in child welfare should be part of a comprehensive approach to identify, assess, and support parents who are affected by substance use. Additionally, since individual bias may occur when testing decisions are left to individual workers, agencies should develop a standardized, equitable process for identifying which parents should be drug tested.The recommendations in the brief are informed by best practices in the field and a comprehensive literature review. NCSACW also recommends that agencies collaborate and coordinate with substance use disorder treatment providers and the courts.More information is available in the full brief, Brief 1: Considerations for Developing a Child Welfare Drug Testing Policy and Protocol, which includes questions to consider and resources for child welfare professionals. For additional information on drug testing in child welfare, the second brief in the series, Brief 2: Drug Testing for Parents Involved in Child Welfare: Three Key Practice Points, describes general considerations to help child welfare professionals implement drug testing in their practice. - Research Brief Explores Cultural Assets of Black Families in the United StatesResearch Brief Explores Cultural Assets of Black Families in the United States In a recent brief from Child Trends, Reimagining Black Families' Cultural Assets Can Inform Policies and Practices That Enhance Their Well-Being, researchers explore Black family life, demographic trends, and cultural assets. One of the researchers' goals is to produce evidence to inform policies and practices that strengthen Black families and improve their well-being. The brief includes four sections: Section 1: Provides an overview of the conceptual model of the research agenda - Section 2: Examines historic perspectives and recent trends for Black families in the United States - Section 3: Explores cultural assets of Black families in the United States, as well as how these assets have changed based on historic, social, or demographic shifts - Section 4: Introduces the need for new data-collection and research approaches that enhance the field's understanding of Black family life and well-being - The researchers argue that certain research perspectives of Black families do not accurately depict shifts in Black families' demographics over the past 20 years. The brief is part of a larger effort by Child Trends researchers to expand knowledge in the child welfare field about Black families' cultural assets.To learn more, read the brief, Reimagining Black Families' Cultural Assets Can Inform Policies and Practices That Enhance Their Well-Being. - Strategies and Tools for Practice This section of CBX offers publications, articles, reports, toolkits, and other resources that provide evidence-based strategies or other concrete help to child welfare and related professionals. Video Series Highlights Importance of Early Relational HealthVideo Series Highlights Importance of Early Relational Health The Perspectives on Early Relational Health Series, a suite of videos from the Center for the Study of Social Policy, includes four sessions during which experts share their perspectives on the importance of foundational early relationships. Each session is between 15 and 25 minutes long, and the presenters include parents, pediatricians, researchers, providers, and other experts. The goal of the series to inspire new insights and support for the movement to promote early relationships so children and caregivers can thrive. Each of the four sessions, listed below, is based on an early relational health topic: "Session 1: The Principles and Framework of Early Relational Health" - "Session 2: The Paradigm Shift in Pediatrics—From Responding to Toxic Stress to Promoting Early Relational Health" - "Session 3: Foundations of Emotional Connection" - "Session 4: Parent and Provider Relationships Grounded in Early Relational Health" - Find the series on the Center for the Study of Social Policy website. - Supporting and Affirming LGBTQ+ Children, Youth, and FamiliesSupporting and Affirming LGBTQ+ Children, Youth, and Families Written by the Capacity Building Center for States LGBTQ+* (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, and others) children and youth, particularly transgender youth, are overrepresented in foster care. Studies indicate that about 30 percent of youth in foster care identify as LGBTQ+, compared with 11 percent of youth not in foster care, and that approximately 5 percent of youth in care identify as transgender, compared with 1 percent of youth not in foster care (Youth.gov, n.d.). Affirming and supporting youth is always the right thing to do, and for LGBTQ+ youth, it can be lifesaving (Green et al., 2021; The Trevor Project, 2019; Turban et al., 2020). Even something as seemingly small as using a young person's preferred pronouns can have a tremendous impact on their well-being.The past few years have seen an uptick in anti-LGBTQ+ policies, including those that penalize parents for affirming and caring for their youth. While many county and district attorneys have pledged to decline to prosecute such cases, the damage and fear has already had traumatic effects for the young people who need gender-affirming care and for the families that want to support them. These are in addition to longstanding policies that limit the rights of LGBTQ+ children, youth, and families and fail to protect even the basic safety of LGBTQ+ youth. In fact, only a single state ensures youth in foster care are placed in bedrooms according to their gender identity. LGBTQ+ children and youth already navigating a landscape of harmful policies may find out-of-home care an exceptionally harrowing experience.What Can You Do to Better Support LGBTQ+ Youth and Families?Child welfare professionals can use the following strategies to ensure practice in their agencies supports LGBTQ+ youth and families.Read and Reflect on the Children's Bureau's GuidanceIn the March 2, 2022, The Family Room blog post, the Children's Bureau outlined its support for LGBTQ+ children and youth. That post and Information Memorandum (ACYF-CB-IM 22-01) describe how to provide safe, affirming care to LGBTQ+ youth and list related provisions in federal law for title IV-B and IV-E agencies.Agency leaders can explore ACYF-CB-IM-22-01 for resources and guidance regarding the use of federal funds for meeting the needs of LGBTQ+ children, youth, and families, such as using title IV-B funds to assist adoptive families in accessing gender-affirming health care for their children. Additionally, agencies can advocate for families at risk of being separated and can use title IV-E funds to promote family preservation. We must think broadly and innovatively to use federal programs and funds as anchors in serving all families and youth in foster care.Review Resources and Best PracticesThe following resources can support agencies working to build capacity to support and affirm LGBTQ+ children, youth, and families:Toolkit to Support Child Welfare Agencies in Serving LGBTQ Children, Youth, and Families (Center for States) - Creating LGBTQ Affirming Agencies Video and Guide (Center for States) - "Supporting and Affirming LGBTQ Children and Youth" [Webinar] (Center for States) - Affirming and Supporting LGBTQ Children and Youth in Child Welfare (Center for States) - Considerations for LGBTQ Children and Youth in Foster Care: Exploring Normalcy as It Relates to P.L. 113–183 (Center for States) - Working With LGBTQ+ Youth and Families [Webpage] (Child Welfare Information Gateway) - National SOGIE Center (University of Maryland) - Dedicate Time and Resources to Building a Safe and Supportive CultureConsider how to advance equity for LGBTQ+ youth by cultivating a culture that recognizes the intersectional identities that individuals hold. As with all diversity initiatives, agencies must be sure to include LGBTQ+ individuals when designing and implementing materials, education, training, and policies.Work to develop and model a culture that is open, accepting, and safe for LGBTQ+ children, youth, families, and staff. Consider how to demonstrate commitment to fostering an affirming environment by approaching different perspectives with curiosity and showing grace and encouragement to those who ask questions. Combine actionable policies and prioritized collaboration with LGBTQ+-affirming community partners to further align your practice and support your workers.To move forward and create or improve an LGBTQ+-affirming culture, take time to pause and reflect on current practice. Below are a few questions to explore when assessing your agency's policies and values so you might better engage and support LGBTQ+ youth and families in foster care:Are your policies intentional about assessing and providing each LGBTQ+ child's and youth's individualized needs? - Are you actively countering barriers to gender-affirming care? - Are you vigilant in placing LGBTQ+ children and youth in homes where they are wholly supported and celebrated? - Are you providing LGBTQ+ youth with opportunities to participate in activities that support their identity and development? - Are you actively building internal capacity to identify, understand, and address issues that LGBTQ+ youth encounter during their child welfare experience? - Are you prepared to provide trauma-competent and trauma-informed services? - Are you working to provide parents who are struggling to accept their child is LGBTQ+ with appropriate training and services? - Are agency staff supported, affirmed, and celebrated as their authentic selves? - Do agency materials, including the website, reflect a diverse representation of children, youth, and families? - ReferencesGreen, A.

> June 2024Vol. 25, No. 5Spotlight on Reunification This edition of CBX spotlights the importance of supporting family reunification. In honor of Pride Month, we also provide resources about youth in child welfare who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, intersex, asexual, Two-Spirit, or other gender or sexual identity (LGBTQIA2S+). Read a message from Commissioner Rebecca Jones Gaston about the need to appropriately serve and support LGBTQIA2S+ children in foster care. Additionally, this issue includes valuable resources for professionals and the families they serve. Issue Spotlight - A Message From Commissioner Rebecca Jones Gaston A Message From Commissioner Rebecca Jones Gaston Written by Commissioner Rebecca Jones Gaston On April 29 of this year, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a final rule on the Designated Placement Requirements Under Titles IV-E and IV-B for LGBTQI+ Children. The final rule requires title IV-E and title IV-B agencies to have sufficient placements designated to meet the needs of children and youth in foster care who are LGBTQI+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, intersex, or other gender or sexual identity) and necessary services to support their well-being. Recognizing the vital role of kin caregivers in the child welfare system, the final rule clarifies that title IV–E and title IV–B agencies should improve access to kinship care as they implement the requirements of this regulation. Children who enter foster care because of familial conflict regarding their LGBTQI+ status or identity may have a supportive relative who is willing to serve as a kin caregiver. And, under the rule, foster care providers, including kin, can receive training and services to designate them as supportive of LGBTQI+ children currently in their care. Nearly 1 in 3 (or approximately 30 percent) of older children in foster care identify as LGBTQI+. Youth in foster care who identify as LGBTQI+ are more likely to experience the following than their non-LGBTQI+ peers: - Be placed in congregate care settings - Report maltreatment while in the foster care system (Cooper et al., 2014) - Experience homelessness The final rule represents a vital step toward safety, permanency, and well-being—foundational priorities of the Children’s Bureau. When children cannot safely remain with their own families, they deserve a supportive foster care placement free of harassment, mistreatment, or abuse. We must continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of LGBTQI+ youth. By creating supportive environments and providing needed resources and services, we can help ensure that LGBTQI+ youth and young adults can thrive and reach their full potential.

As children, the way we learn about and understand the world starts with grasping the ABCs. What if we took those lessons out of the traditional classroom and applied them to child welfare? Reunification is one of the foundational goals of child welfare practice—to bring families back together. During National Reunification Month this June, let’s look at the importance of reunification through the lens of the ABCs by Acknowledging that all families deserve an opportunity for reunification, Believing that families can achieve this goal, and Committing to a culturally responsive approach to reunification. A - Acknowledge: All families deserve an opportunity to reunify, regardless of their past challenges or circumstances. Acknowledging this fundamental principle of equitability is essential in the reunification process. It requires recognizing that every family has inherent worth and dignity, and that reunification is a right that should be afforded to all families. By acknowledging this truth, we affirm our commitment to fairness and justice in the child welfare system. B - Believe: Believe that all families have functional strengths for the reunification journey. Hope is the cornerstone of reunification, and believing in the potential of families to overcome obstacles and thrive is paramount. It involves recognizing and amplifying families' voices, strengths, and resources. Belief is contagious. When we nurture a culture of hope and optimism, we help families envision a future where they can reunify and flourish together. C - Commit: Commit to a culturally responsive approach to reunification. As child welfare professionals, our commitment goes beyond cultural awareness to celebrating the intersecting identities that shape each family. We recognize that race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender identity and expression affect an individual’s worldview, experiences, and relationships. By committing to a culturally responsive approach that prioritizes family ties and kin, we acknowledge the systemic inequities and biases that affect underserved communities and work toward dismantling them. Think about the opportunities you have to Acknowledge, Believe, and Commit during June and beyond. Grounded in the simplicity of the ABCs is the absolute ability to transform lives and create an environment where every child, youth, and young adult is nurtured and encouraged to thrive within their family and community. - Reunification From Foster Care: A Guide for Parents Reunification From Foster Care: A Guide for Parents For many parents, the process of reuniting with their children who are in foster care can be overwhelming. A recently updated factsheet from Child Welfare Information Gateway provides parents with guidance for the reunification process. Reunification From Foster Care: A Guide for Parents walks parents through the essential steps they will take to navigate the reunification process. This guide is designed to educate and empower parents with the knowledge and support they need for successful family reunification. The factsheet highlights the collaborative nature of this journey and introduces the team that will support parents throughout the process, including caseworkers and resource parents. A cooperative relationship between the biological and resource parents can significantly affect the ease of transition for the child returning home. It also strongly emphasizes the importance of parents understanding their rights within the foster care system, empowering them to advocate effectively for themselves and their children. Other aspects covered include what to expect while the child is in foster care, what a case plan might include, the critical importance of maintaining quality family time, and the significant role parents play in the reunification process. After reunification, families may encounter different challenges. Parents can read about what they might expect after reunification as they welcome their child back into their home and adjust to being together again. The factsheet also connects parents with national parent and family organizations, offering additional support networks and resources.

The webinar reviews the history of father involvement in child welfare, acknowledging how perspectives and approaches have shifted over time. The presenter, Child Welfare Consultant Chauncey Strong, discusses the significant role that fathers play in the family dynamic and the benefits of their engagement in the reunification process. The webinar also explores the challenges and successful strategies associated with effectively engaging fathers. This includes a discussion about cultural and systemic barriers that can complicate father engagement. Participants from various QIC-R sites also shared how their agencies are working to better integrate fathers into their programs, aiming to create a more family-centered approach. The webinar emphasizes the necessity of including fathers and the positive outcomes associated with their involvement. The recorded webinar and the PowerPoint presentation are available online for those interested in the details of the discussion or in implementing similar strategies in their practices. - How Child Welfare Agencies Can Support Reunification How Child Welfare Agencies Can Support Reunification The American Bar Association's Center on Children and the Law hosted a webinar, "What Child Welfare Agencies Can Do to Support Reunification," on resource and foster caregivers' roles in the reunification process. The session focused on how child welfare agencies can facilitate and strengthen the connection between foster caregivers and parents—a relationship that is pivotal in supporting family reunification. Featuring examples from the Oregon and Georgia Departments of Human Services, the webinar explored practices agencies can adopt to enhance this partnership, emphasizing the importance of supporting family time and maintaining children's connections with their families. By fostering these relationships, agencies not only support the emotional well-being of children in foster care but also improve the chances for successful family reunification. The webinar also explored the parents' perspective, included recommendations for improving practice and the Parents Supporting Parents model, and offered insights and concrete strategies for child welfare professionals and those interested in the dynamics of foster care and family reunification. The recorded session and the accompanying PowerPoint presentation are available, providing resources for implementing these practices effectively within child welfare agencies.

A secure environment is especially needed during the reunification of youth who identify as LGBTQIA2S+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex, asexual, Two-Spirit, and other diverse gender and sexual identities). According to Youth.gov, LGBTQ+ youth are overrepresented in child welfare systems, even though they are likely to be underreported because they risk harassment and abuse if their LGBTQ+ identity is disclosed.1 Studies have found that about 30 percent of youth in foster care identify as LGBTQ+ and 5 percent as transgender, in comparison to 11 percent and 1 percent, respectively, of youth not in foster care.2 Furthermore, LGBTQ+ youth of color are disproportionately overrepresented and stay longer in child welfare systems while also having an increased risk of experiencing discrimination and violence compared to their peers.3 Reunification Challenges These young LGBTQIA2S+ individuals often face unique challenges and barriers during the reunification process: - Lack of understanding: Some adults or other professionals involved in the youth's life may lack awareness about LGBTQIA2S+ issues. - Stigma or discrimination: Fear of stigma prevents some LGBTQIA2S+ youth from seeking help or asking important questions. - Access to information: Some LGBTQIA2S+ youth may need digital resources to navigate relevant topics or locate other youth in similar situations. However, technology can play a pivotal role in helping to address their information needs, foster safe and inclusive environments, and reduce some potential reunification barriers. Safe Digital Spaces Today’s technology can provide a lifeline by creating safe digital spaces where LGBTQIA2S+ youth can connect with their peers, find support, and express their authentic selves, such as the following examples: - Safe space apps have been developed specifically for LGBTQIA2S+ youth to provide information on local resources, legal rights, and mental health support. Having access to this material can empower LGBTQIA2S+ youth to better advocate for themselves during the reunification process. - Mental health apps can provide virtual counseling and therapy. These tools allow LGBTQIA2S+ youth to access mental health services discreetly to address their emotional well-being during the reunification process. - Online support groups can offer safe spaces for LGBTQIA2S+ youth to share their experiences, seek advice, and build connections. Some platforms also allow anonymity, which can be crucial for those youth who fear judgment but need the advice of others sharing related reunification events. Technology for Empowerment During the reunification process, LGBTQIA2S+ youth can also investigate the following youth-centric technology: - Interactive websites: This technology engages youth with topics such as frequently asked questions, success stories, relevant advice, and video testimonials from LGBTQIA2S+ individuals who have navigated the reunification process successfully. - Youth advisory boards: Some digital platforms facilitate virtual youth advisory boards where LGBTQIA2S+ youth can actively participate in shaping child welfare policies and technology systems. Their insights can drive positive changes for the reunification process of current and future LGBTQIA2S+ youth. - Learning resources: Webinars, training modules, and e-learning resources that offer relevant LGBTQIA2S+ youth topics are available online. Adult and Caregiver Resources To learn more about LGBTQIA2S+ youth concerns, the following adult and caregiver resources may be available: - Online training modules: Adults in a youth's life or interested child welfare professionals can access trainings or online modules on topics such as LGBTQIA2S+ cultural competency, pronoun usage, and self-care. - Virtual workshops: Hosted webinars and workshops held for parents, kin (including maternal and paternal relatives as well as fictive kin), foster parents, and child welfare professionals can bring understanding and acceptance of LGBTQIA2S+ youth as well as a successful reunification outcome. Summary Technology has the potential to transform lives and improve the reunification process for LGBTQIA2S+ youth. By creating safe digital spaces, breaking down barriers, empowering youth, and helping their adult caregivers, technology can help ensure that every young person feels seen, heard, and valued. Let’s embrace technology as a positive catalyst for change to build a more inclusive future for everyone.

A recent Executive Order and Office of Management and Budget Memorandum underscored AI's promise in government services, highlighting its capacity to enhance efficiency and tailor services to individual beneficiaries. However, despite its potential benefits, concerns remain regarding AI's ethical and equitable use. AI, defined in the White House Executive Order as a machine-based system capable of making predictions and recommendations, has significant implications for government operations. Leveraging available data and statistical methodologies, AI algorithms can generate predictions and recommendations, shaping decision-making processes. However, AI's evolving nature poses unique challenges. Unlike traditional statistical models, AI continuously learns and adapts, resulting in outcomes that may be less transparent and predictable. The blog suggests that AI can generate evidence. However, it requires careful interpretation and consideration by humans and should not be taken as the end point of or the sole contributor to decision-making. Effective use of AI evidence requires attention to data quality—including biases embedded in the data—and application. Collaborative approaches, emphasizing partner engagement and capacity building, are essential to ensure robust governance and integration of AI within government frameworks. The blog highlights the importance of aligning with existing federal frameworks, a human-centered approach, and ethical considerations when evaluating AI's potential for societal benefit. The implications for policy and practice are complex. Policymakers should explore the ethical dilemmas surrounding AI implementation and make decisions that uphold principles of transparency and fairness. Additionally, practitioners should adapt to the evolving landscape, acquiring the skills to leverage AI insights effectively. - Children's Bureau Website Updates Children's Bureau Website Updates The Children's Bureau website hosts information on child welfare programs, funding, monitoring, training and technical assistance, laws, statistics, research, federal reporting, and much more.

Training & Technical Assistance Updates This section features resources and updates from the Children's Bureau's technical assistance partners to support practices and systems that improve the lives of children and families. - New Training on Adapting Family Finding and Engagement Practices for LGBTQ+ Youth New Training on Adapting Family Finding and Engagement Practices for LGBTQ+ Youth A new online training from the National SOGIE Center provides information on supporting young people who identify as LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, or other gender or sexual identity) during family finding and engagement processes. The free, 45-minute training provides information on supporting these young people and helping the adults in their lives understand and support them as well. Having a solid support network and lifelong connections is essential for all youth and young adults, especially those in and aging out of foster care. Young people in care who identify as LGBTQ+ may need additional support forging new connections and nurturing existing relationships due to unique stressors, such as disclosing their LGBTQ+ identity. In addition, the adults in their lives may need guidance on how to best support and affirm these young people. The training is provided by the National SOGIE Center and the National Quality Improvement Center on Tailored Services, Placement Stability, and Permanency for LGBTQ2S Children and Youth in Foster Care and is available on the National SOGIE Center website. The SOGIE Center offers a series of other trainings related to supporting LGBTQ+ youth, such as a training on creating affirming environments, best practices, and proper terminology.

The Capacity Building Center for Tribes Prevention Brief defines each stage of the prevention services continuum within a tribal context: - Primary prevention services cultivate resilience, strengthen families, and educate caregivers through information, activities, and resources available in a community. These include supports for basic needs, cultural activities, family healing circles, and employment support. - Secondary prevention services support families experiencing challenges to reduce the risk of maltreatment. These include mental and behavioral health services, education and skill development, and in-home services. - Tertiary prevention services are available in homes where maltreatment has occurred. These include kinship support, housing assistance, and legal support. The brief goes on to detail prevention services available through tribal programming, including therapeutic cultural traditions and practices. It also outlines an example of tribal prevention services: the Ho-Chunk Nation’s Family Healing Camp, a culturally centered community event that offers wellness activities, healing circles, support groups, and more. The Capacity Building Center for Tribes Path to Prevention guide compiles training and technical assistance resources available to support tribal child welfare programs in developing and implementing prevention programs and practices. This includes resources available on the Center for Tribes' website as well as supports available for tribes with title IV-B and title IV-E funding. - New Series on Harm Reduction for Substance Use in the Context of Child Well-Being New Series on Harm Reduction for Substance Use in the Context of Child Well-Being A series from the National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare (NCSACW) provides an overview of a harm reduction approach to support children, caregivers, and family members affected by substance use disorders. The series features three tip sheets on the following topics: - An Overview for Serving Families Affected by Substance Use Disorders - Key Considerations for Policymakers - Practice Recommendations for Child Welfare Workers The first tip sheet defines harm reduction as an approach that focuses on meeting the needs of an individual by improving access and engagement in substance use disorder treatment services. It provides an overview of the approach, while the following two tip sheets provide considerations and recommendations for more specific audiences: policymakers and child welfare professionals. The series is available on the NCSACW website. - Updates From the Children's Bureau's Training and Technical Assistance Partners Updates From the Children's Bureau's Training and Technical Assistance Partners The Children's Bureau funds several technical assistance centers to provide professionals with tools to better serve children, youth, and families.

Child Welfare Research In this section, we highlight recent studies, literature reviews, and other research on child welfare topics. - Scoping Review Explores Research on LGBTQ Youth and Caregivers in Child Welfare Scoping Review Explores Research on LGBTQ Youth and Caregivers in Child Welfare Individuals who identify as members of the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning) community are prevalent in child welfare, with LGBTQ youth being overrepresented in care and an increasing number of LGBTQ people becoming foster parents. A scoping review published in Child and Family Social Work examines research on child welfare practice with LGBTQ youth, caregivers, and foster caregivers. The review is anchored in the following research questions: - What is known about the practices of child welfare services toward LGBTQ youth and caregivers? - What is known about LGBTQ foster parents? Forty-five studies published between 2000 and 2021 met the inclusion criteria, with the majority taking place in the United States and after 2014. The included studies are organized into three theme categories: LGBTQ youth in contact with child welfare services, foster parents, and child welfare practice from an LGBTQ perspective. While the review shows that published literature about LGBTQ youth and caregivers is increasing, it also shows there are relatively few empirical peer-reviewed studies on the topic. The findings indicate that LGBTQ youth are disproportionately represented in child welfare and have an increased risk for adverse health outcomes compared with non-LGBTQ youth. However, there are limited data on the number of LGBTQ youth in the system and no studies estimate the number of foster parents who identify as LGBTQ. The review highlights several areas where more research is needed, including research on the following topics: - Caseworker attitudes, knowledge, and experiences working with LGBTQ individuals - Non-LGBTQ foster parents of LGBTQ youth - Interventions to support LGBTQ youth - Transgender and intersex people within child welfare - The intersection of being LGBTQ and seeking health care More information is available in the review, "What is Known About the LGBTQ Perspective in Child Welfare Services: A Scoping Review." - Considerations for Linking Child Welfare and Medicaid Data Considerations for Linking Child Welfare and Medicaid Data Historically, states have not linked their child welfare and Medicaid data, despite many children involved with child welfare being eligible for Medicaid. A recent project from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation; the Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation; and RTI International explores the benefits of connecting this data. The Child and Caregiver Outcomes Using Linked Data (CCOULD) project began in October 2019. Its goal was to provide technical assistance to states in linking child welfare case-level data and Medicaid administrative claims of children and their caregivers. A recent research brief provides lessons learned from the project based on the experiences of two states, Kentucky and Florida. Both states created linked datasets covering 2016 through 2021, with Florida's including 80 percent of children who had been in contact with child welfare and Kentucky's including 81 percent. The brief highlights lessons learned in four categories: - State recruitment and short- and long-term sustainability of the linkage project: Florida and Kentucky joined the project following a robust recruitment effort, which took longer than anticipated, according to the report. In the future, linkage efforts could focus on highlighting the value of linking data to states. - Data availability, consistency, and quality: Agencies may not have data dictionaries or user guides for their data and infrastructure. There was also a lack of data on caregivers and title IV-E prevention services. - State and federal regulations related to data linkage and sharing: States may benefit from clarifying regulations, improving data sharing, and following federal guidance. - Linkage methodology: The CCOULD project used a common data model and was able to link most children and caregivers using Social Security numbers. However, the linkage of parents to children was challenging because of a lack of family identifiers in Medicaid claims. To explore the lessons learned in more detail, read the full research brief, Linking Child Welfare and Medicaid Data: Lessons Learned From Two States. Strategies and Tools for Practice This section of CBX offers publications, articles, reports, toolkits, and other resources that provide evidence-based strategies or other concrete help to child welfare and related professionals. - The Role of Parent Partner Programs in Supporting Prevention and Reunification The Role of Parent Partner Programs in Supporting Prevention and Reunification A brief from Casey Family Programs discusses the positive impacts of parent partner programs in child welfare, such as offering guidance and hope to parents navigating challenging circumstances. Focusing on reunification, these programs provide support by drawing on the firsthand experiences of individuals who have already experienced the child welfare system. Research underscores the effectiveness of these programs, indicating higher rates of reunification among parents who participate compared to those who do not. The brief covers several aspects of parent partner programs: - How parents benefit - What research says - How parent partner programs are structured - How parent partner programs are funded - What to consider during implementation The brief also highlights three parent partner programs: Parents Anonymous, the Kentucky Sobriety Treatment and Recovery Team (START) Program, and Iowa's Parent Partner Program. These initiatives offer tailored support and resources to parents, empowering them to navigate the complexities of the child welfare system and work toward reunification: - Parents Anonymous offers support groups, parent partner services, and helpline support to parents and caregivers facing challenges in an effort to mitigate the impact of and prevent adverse childhood experiences. - The Kentucky START Program pairs child welfare workers and family mentors to work with families to provide quick access to intensive substance use treatment. Decision-making involves all team members, focusing on child safety, permanency, and parental sobriety. - Iowa's Parent Partner Program matches parents involved in the system with mentors who have successfully navigated similar challenges. The program seeks to help families access community resources. Each mentor commits to working with a family for 7 to 10 hours monthly, with up to 15 parents per mentor. Research shows that all three programs produced positive outcomes. Parents Anonymous participants were significantly less likely to have a subsequent child maltreatment referral and substantiated maltreatment finding. Participants in both the Kentucky START Program and Iowa's Parent Partner Program showed higher rates of reunification compared to those who were not in the program. Visit the Casey Family Programs website to read How Do Parent Partner Programs Instill Hope and Support Prevention and Reunification? For more information on the importance of implementing parent voice in child welfare and early childhood systems, read "New Resource Emphasizes Value of Parent Voice" from the April 2024 edition of Children's Bureau Express. - Kin-Finding Toolkit Provides Best Practices for Connecting Youth With Kin Kin-Finding Toolkit Provides Best Practices for Connecting Youth With Kin The benefits of kinship care placements and strong connections with kin are well-studied in child welfare. However, it can be challenging for child welfare agencies to identify and connect with extended family members. Recognizing these challenges, the Grandfamilies and Kinship Support Network released a kin-finding toolkit to help agencies increase their kin placement rates. The ideas and resources were compiled from more than 35 child welfare agencies across the country. The toolkit provides tools, strategies, and information about 22 promising kin-finding practices and how agencies can implement the practices. Examples of these practices include the following: - Ask youth about their kin and use tools like genograms and heart maps to identify a youth's important relationships. - Use an expansive legal definition of kin and leverage the court system to encourage kin-finding. - Use social media to find kin as well as a variety of contact methods. - Involve kin prior to removal and make a plan to keep youth connected to their supportive adults. - Make keeping in touch with kin a formal foster family responsibility. - Make sure kin have a robust presence at meetings. - Use methods like "Extreme Family Finding" and never stop looking for kin. Explore the toolkit for more details about the promising practices to promote and increase kin-first culture in child welfare. - New Resource Helps Support LGBTQ+ Youth in School, Health, and Child Welfare Settings New Resource Helps Support LGBTQ+ Youth in School, Health, and Child Welfare Settings The Center for the Study of Social Policy and the National SOGIE Center released a frequently asked questions brief to help professionals in behavioral health, child welfare, and educational settings support youth who identify as LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, or other gender or sexual identity). The brief explores common legal challenges associated with working with LGBTQ+ individuals and outlines federal protections and resources. Legal challenges associated with working with LGTBQ+ individuals may stem from anti-LGBTQ+ policies, such as prohibiting the discussion of certain topics or the use of certain words or denying services based on sexual orientation or gender identity. As professionals, it can be difficult to know how to respond to these situations. The document provides answers to eight frequently asked questions from professionals who work in behavioral health, child welfare, and school settings. Each response features recommended approaches to challenges and links to additional resources. The following are examples of the questions included: - I can't talk to young people about sexual orientation or gender identity and expression unless I get written permission from their families. What can I do? - Can I write a letter of support for gender-affirming treatment if my state or locality is debating whether affirming care is "abuse"? - I've been instructed to use a youth's legal name on documentation instead of their affirmed or chosen name. What can I do? The brief is designed to help providers navigate complicated policy challenges related to supporting LGBTQ+ youth and their families. While it provides strategies and resources, it is important to note that the brief is not a substitute for legal advice. FAQ for Behavioral Health Providers: Supporting LGBTQ+ Youth in School, Health, and Child Welfare Settings is available on the Center for the Study of Social Policy website. - Beyond the Basics of LGBTQIA2S+ Inclusivity: Resources and Supports to Meet Child Welfare Agencies Where They Are Beyond the Basics of LGBTQIA2S+ Inclusivity: Resources and Supports to Meet Child Welfare Agencies Where They Are Written by the Capacity Building Center for States Children and young people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, intersex, asexual, Two-Spirit, or other gender or sexual identity (LGBTQIA2S+) are disproportionately represented in the child welfare system (Capacity Building Center for States, 2023). This calls on providers across the child welfare network to respond, but there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to progress toward more inclusive LGBTQIA2S+ policies and practices for individual child welfare agencies. Some agencies may just be getting started, while others may have many years of experience developing and implementing inclusive policies and practices. The political climates of the states in which the child welfare agencies operate may also contribute to the disparity in policies and practices among jurisdictions. While the number of pro-equality bills enacted in 2023 more than doubled, the rise of anti-LGBTQIA2S+ health and safety bills nearly quadrupled (Human Rights Campaign, 2024). As a result, a wide variety of resources is needed, especially for those agencies looking to advance their knowledge and practice related to the needs of LGBTQIA2S+ children and young people beyond foundational awareness. This curated collection of resources can help meet agencies where they are—regardless of levels of experience, progress toward more inclusive practices and policies, or political climates—to help them create and sustain more inclusive environments for LGBTQIA2S+ children, young people, and families. Staff Training Child welfare agencies seeking to progress beyond awareness of LGBTQIA2S+ information and challenges can start by offering staff training designed to raise cultural competencies and antidiscrimination requirements (Human Rights Campaign, 2023). The Capacity Building Center for States (Center for States) provides practical information about the needs and challenges faced by LGBTQIA2S+ children and young people at child welfare agencies, including helping agencies do the following: - Understand where they are in providing an affirming culture and climate for LGBTQIA2S+ children, young people, and families - Learn how to hold frank and open conversations with staff and caregivers regularly to create a safe and affirming environment for LGBTQIA2S+ children and young people - Make plans for improving the well-being of LGBTQIA2S+ children and young people Creating an Affirming Culture and Climate for LGBTQIA2S+ Children and Young People in Child Welfare is a Center for States resource to assess agency culture and climate for LGBTQIA2S+ people and learn how to hold frank conversations about LGBTQIA2S+ topics with staff and caregivers. The Center for States also has resources to help agencies create a more affirming culture and climate, increase authentic engagement with families and young people, and engage a diverse and inclusive team, as well as tools to support agencies with serving LGBTQIA2S+ children, young people, and families and implement a more inclusive agency climate for these populations. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services offers training through the National LGBTQIA+ Health Education Center, which includes numerous learning resources such as webinars, publications, learning modules, toolkits, videos, and a glossary (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.). The Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s All Children - All Families is a resource for "child welfare agencies seeking training, technical assistance, and model policies for improving practice" when working with LGBTQIA2S+ children and young people (Human Rights Campaign, 2023). It has established benchmarks of LGBTQ+ inclusion that consider the realities of different levels of progress toward inclusive child welfare policies. Its three levels—building foundation for inclusion, solid foundation for inclusion, and innovative inclusion—progress from basics like improving inclusivity in forms, paperwork, and messaging to intermediate steps like establishing sustainable practices for both young people and parents to advanced steps like serving as inclusivity allies and leaders in the broader community (Human Rights Campaign, 2023). Agencies can participate in the All Children – All Families Agency Self-Assessment (free) or learn more about the National Training Program (fee for service at a sliding scale) (Human Rights Campaign, n.d.). Substance Abuse and Mental Health Supports Agencies that have moved beyond the basics may be considering implementing more intersectional supports, such as those around substance abuse and mental health. The Center for States has resources that prioritize cross-system partnerships and ensure children and young people receive vital mental health services. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration offers a variety of training curricula and resources, such as A Provider’s Introduction to Substance Abuse Treatment for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Individuals; A Practitioner’s Resource Guide: Helping Families to Support Their LGBT Children; and Helping Families Support Their Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) Children (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, n.d.). A particularly important mental health concern for LGBTQIA2S+ children and young people is the risk of suicide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people aged 10 to 14 and the third leading cause among those aged 15 to 24. LGBTQIA2S+ children and young people are more than four times as likely to attempt suicide as their peers (The Trevor Project, 2024). The Trevor Project, a national organization dedicated to ending suicide among LGBTQIA2S+ young people, provides crisis services, research, education and public awareness, and advocacy. The Trevor Project's CARE (Connect, Accept, Respond, Empower) is an interactive and intensive suicide-prevention training that provides adults, including child welfare professionals, kindergarten–12 school staff and educators, higher education staff and faculty, and health-care professionals with an overview of suicide among LGBTQIA2S+ children and young people and "the different environmental stressors that contribute to their heightened risk for suicide" (The Trevor Project, n.d.). Child welfare professionals can promote greater inclusivity for LGBTQIA2S+ children, young people, and families in myriad ways. Whether an agency is just getting started on its journey toward more inclusive practices and culture or seeking ways to add to existing services, numerous resources and organizations are ready to meet them where they are to provide a more welcoming child welfare system for all.

While this is an exciting time for many children, youth, and families, summer can be a daunting season for new foster and adoptive parents who may face a variety of unknowns and challenges. A blog post from AdoptUSKids seeks to address some of this uncertainty with information and guidance for foster and adoptive parents on engaging and caring for children and youth during the summer months. The article explains how transitions in schedule can affect children who have experienced trauma and follows with an overview of some general options and considerations related to child care, summer camps, family vacations, and more.

The journal Child and Family Social Work published a scoping review examining existing research on child welfare services for LGBTQ youth, their caregivers, and foster parents. The researchers used the following two questions to guide their research: What is known about the practices of child welfare services toward LGBTQ youth and caregivers? - What is known about LGBTQ foster parents? - The experiences, prevalence, and outcomes of LGBTQ youth who come into contact with child welfare - The perspectives of LGBTQ foster parents and foster caregivers of youth in care who are LGBTQ - Child welfare practice in an LGBTQ perspective -

> April 2016Vol. 17, No. 2Youth Qualitative Interview Findings A brief from the Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation (OPRE) highlights findings from qualitative interviews with nine participants in the RISE (Recognize Intervene Support Empower) Initiative. One of six Permanency Innovations Initiative (PII) grantees, RISE focuses on reducing time in long-term foster care and increasing permanency options for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer and questioning (LGBTQ) youth. RISE is administered by the Los Angeles LGBT Center in partnership with the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services, plus more than 20 community and foster care agencies. PII is a Federal, multisite demonstration project aimed at transforming child welfare policy and practice through increasing evidence-supported interventions. Interview findings formed part of an initial evaluation of the PII project. Interviewees' comments focused on their opinions of RISE, their experiences in foster care, and ways their lives changed as they received services. They contributed to the project's goal of measuring the short-term outcomes of decreased heterosexism and transphobia, and monitoring participants' understanding of RISE interventions. Two RISE interventions support and educate LGBTQ children and youth, parents, caregivers, and child welfare professionals: a Care Coordination Team (CCT) and Outreach and Relationship Building services. The nine youth interviewed for this evaluation were participating in a CCT, which consists of the following: The facilitator implements the plan of care, which includes emotional, LGBTQ identity, and legal permanency components. - The youth specialist engages and encourages LGBTQ youth with identity development and helps to build a trust-based relationship with them through a positive youth development model. - The family finder extends the support system for LGBTQ youth through identifying and locating adults who can support them. - The parent partner educates, supports, and strategizes with adults in the lives of LGBTQ youth to minimize rejection and capitalize on ways to support them. - The brief shares key findings from the nine interviews related to their experiences receiving RISE services, such as the following: RISE staff. Youth spoke about feeling comfortable and open with their RISE team, becoming close to them, receiving support and understanding, and feeling like their team really cared about them. - Someone who understands. Youth specified that they liked talking to someone who was also LGBTQ and thus knows where they're coming from. - Family relationships. Youth brought up instances where RISE helped them connect with their families. - LGBTQ identity. Most youth said that participating in RISE helped them realize, define, or be able to express their LGBTQ identity. - The authors conclude that the qualitative interviews, conducted during summer 2015, captured both a positive effect on youth as well as improvement in their natural and formal supports. The evaluation team indicated that their sample of nine interviewees was a nonrepresentative sample of CCT youth participants; therefore, a second set of interviews will be conducted to validate their findings. A final report on formative evaluation outcomes of the RISE initiative will be available from OPRE in 2016.

> - Facilitators - Program Administrators Health Equity In episode three, "Health Equity," Elevate Youth Programming, sat down with Dr. Asari Offiong and Catherine Schaefer from Child Trend to discuss integrating a health equity perspective into Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention (APP) and other youth-centered programs. Despite significant declines in teen pregnancies in the United States, disparities across race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and ability continue to persist. To mitigate these disparities, it is necessary to consistently integrate a health equity lens into your APP and other youth-centered programming. Health equity is inclusive and intentional—it involves adjusting language and programming as needed and honoring the experiences of individuals, particularly those who are the most vulnerable. When health equity is a priority, it is woven into the culture of how the work is funded, managed, delivered, and evaluated. We recognize that some of these changes require higher levels of influence and reflect larger organizational/societal barriers. Nonetheless, we encourage programs and grantees to think strategically about health equity within their own sphere of influence and provide tips and strategies to do so in this episode. Dr. Offiong is a research scientist at Child Trends with a focus on using asset-based approaches in research and practice to promote positive health outcomes among youth. She has experience designing, implementing, and evaluating prevention programs focused on sexual and reproductive health and substance use, particularly for youth of color in inner-city settings. Ms. Schaefer is a senior analyst at Child Trends in Early Childhood Development. Her work is focused on LGBTQ+ topics, specifically gender identity development and LGBTQ+ health outcomes. The Elevate Youth Programming podcast was developed by RTI International and funded by FYSB. The Elevate Youth Programming content does not reflect the opinions of FYSB, nor its training and technical assistance contractors, but offers topics to provoke thought and provide grantees with tips and strategies to enhance programming.

Creating an Inclusive Organizational Culture to Support LGBTQ+ Youth—November 2024 [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.cbexpress.acf.hhs.gov/article/2024/november/creating-an-inclusive-organizational-culture-to-support-lgbtq-youth/67211ab88795d210106fb848cebb35ae)

> November 2024Vol. 25, No. 9Creating an Inclusive Organizational Culture to Support LGBTQ+ Youth A recent webinar from the Center for Juvenile Justice Reform (CJJR) within the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University presents a discussion of capstone projects from its certificate program for supporting youth who are LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, or other gender or sexual identity). The projects focused on creating inclusive cultures for LGBTQ+ youth in their home communities. LGBTQ+ children and youth face a lot of unique challenges—for example, they are more likely to be bullied or rejected by others, including their own family, which can lead to higher rates of running away and truancy. They also often receive more severe punishments at school and in secure facilities or are held in secure detention for relatively minor offenses. It is essential to create a safe, affirming, and inclusive environment for these youth. Panelists discussed the experiences, challenges, and lessons learned from justice agencies and community organizations that have created supportive environments for LGBTQ+ youth. One featured project focused on reducing homelessness rates for LGBTQ+ young adults by reuniting them with their families. Faith-based communities were a core partnership with the program, and training and understanding conversations with church leaders coupled with youth-driven listening sessions were an important step in creating buy-in and affirming environments. The other featured project worked at a systemic level to create a more understanding environment that considered the holistic identities of youth to better meet their needs. Panelists discussed strategies for identifying and engaging the right partners at different levels to create a well-represented team, their two-tier approach to training, and the importance of valuing and involving the voices of those with lived experience. Panelists addressed how they created spaces in which people felt comfortable hearing new ideas and approaches—even if they were initially hesitant about new strategies or engaging with youth about their LGBTQ+ identities. Strategies included working with a community advocate, giving people the space to understand and process without being pushed, and providing data that concretely shows the problem. They also discussed details about what the trainings look like, how trainings were rolled out, and advice for jurisdictions, organizations, and communities looking to engage and do similar work.

LGBTQ Youth in Maryland Education, Foster Care, Juvenile Justice—November 2014 [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.cbexpress.acf.hhs.gov/article/2014/november/lgbtq-youth-in-maryland-education-foster-care-juvenile-justice/aa28c4cf1b52c150517620efe54bcb7a)

> November 2014Vol. 15, No. 10LGBTQ Youth in Maryland Education, Foster Care, Juvenile Justice A June 2014 Youth Equality Alliance (YEA) report, Living in the Margins, examines the challenges lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth often encounter as they navigate the education, child welfare, and juvenile justice systems in Maryland. The report also highlights the State's current efforts to address the needs of this vulnerable and underserved youth population, and it provides recommendations for addressing these issues. Bullying from peers, rejection (or fear of rejection) from family, and lack of assistance from misinformed and/or prejudiced school personnel and related professionals can have dire consequences for this marginalized population. For example, LGBTQ youth in out-of-home care settings may encounter hostility or indifference from case workers, foster families, and other youth because of institutional bias, lack of understanding and training, and intolerance. As a result, LGBTQ youth may be removed from or run away from their foster or group homes. Data from national studies are alarming and highlight these issues: LGBTQ youth are overrepresented in the foster care system (approximately 17.5 percent compared to 5 to 10 percent of the general population). - Three out of four LGBTQ youth experience prejudicial treatment by foster care service providers because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. - Approximately 70 percent of LGBTQ youth report being victims of physical violence in State-run group homes, and 78 percent report being removed or running away from placements. - Approximately 40 percent of homeless youth identify as LGBTQ. - Recommendations for addressing these myriad challenges are provided for each area—education, foster care, and juvenile justice—and include three or more overarching recommendations that are presented in more specific bulleted lists of recommendations. Regarding the challenges faced by LGBTQ youth involved in the child welfare system, YEA proposes the following actions for the Maryland Department of Human Resources (DHR): Identify the needs of LGBTQ youth in the child welfare system and develop appropriate resources: Conduct needs assessments of LGBTQ youth in care to identify gaps in policy and service delivery - Develop/expand counseling programs and community resources for LGBTQ youth - Ensure that child welfare staff and foster parents are made aware of the LGBTQ-specific agency and community resources that are available - - Develop, adopt, and enforce statewide LGBTQ-specific nondiscrimination policies in all child welfare agencies: Create comprehensive policies that provide guidance for working with LGBTQ youth - Mandate LGBTQ training for State and local child welfare and related staff and foster parents, and make completion of the training a condition of employment/licensing - - Create points of contact throughout the child welfare system for youth and professionals: Develop a confidential grievance procedure for LGBTQ youth reporting harassment and designate an ombudsman to oversee this grievance process - Designate an LGBTQ agency coordinator and local LGBTQ staff liaisons - - Appendices of terminology and report contributors are also included. Living in the Margins: A Report on the Challenges of LGBTQ Youth in Maryland Education, Foster Care, and Juvenile Justice Systems is the first report developed by YEA.

> July 2012Vol. 13, No. 6Resources for Serving LGBTQ Youth The National Resource Center for In-Home Services (NRC In-Home) recently released new resources for child welfare professionals who work with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth. The NRC In-Home hosted a webinar in May titled "Building Support to Serve Families of LGBTQ Youth." The webinar, which is now posted on the NRC's website, coincides with the NRC's publication of In-Home Services for Families of LGBTQ Youth. In April 2011, the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) released an Information Memorandum concerning the LGBTQ population in foster care. The NRC's resources echo data from the Information Memorandum about LGBTQ youth being overrepresented in the population served by the child welfare system. While it's difficult to know exactly how many LGBTQ youth are in out-of-home care, research suggests they are disproportionately represented in foster care and among the population of runaway and homeless youth. One study of three Midwestern States found that more than 23 percent of female and more than 10 percent of male respondents reported a sexual orientation other than heterosexual. Like other runaway or homeless youth, this population is considered to be at high risk for negative outcomes including unemployment, teen pregnancy, interaction with the juvenile justice system, low educational attainment, and more. The NRC's publication In-Home Services for Families of LGBTQ Youth provides background information on this vulnerable population and on the impact of familial rejection—which is often the cause of their involvement with the child welfare system or their runaway or homeless status. Additionally, the publication explains the critical need for in-home services for LGBTQ youth and provides examples of research-based, family-focused interventions and promising practice models. In-Home Services for Families of LGBTQ Youth, by Diane E. Elze, is available on the NRC's website: http://nrcinhome.socialwork.uiowa.edu/resources/documents/LGBTissuebriefwithpractice.pdf (837 KB) Materials from the webinar, available on the NRC's website, include the following: PowerPoint presentation slides - Webcast presentation - Family Acceptance Project Overall Best Practices Flyer - Family Acceptance Project Resource List - LGBTQ Glossary - Transgender-Related Terminology Handout - The webinar materials are available here: http://www.nrcinhome.socialwork.uiowa.edu/events/archived.shtml

Sociodemographic Characteristics of LGBTQ Parents in the United States—November 2024 [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.cbexpress.acf.hhs.gov/article/2024/november/sociodemographic-characteristics-of-lgbtq-parents-in-the-united-states/e98f46388795d210106fb848cebb3569)

> November 2024Vol. 25, No. 9Sociodemographic Characteristics of LGBTQ Parents in the United States Much of the existing research on parenting benefits, challenges, and demographics is focused on cisgender, heterosexual parents. A new report expands this research by compiling data from various sources to provide a sociodemographic portrait of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer+ (LGBTQ) parents in the United States. In the report, LGBTQ Parenting in the US, the term "parent" includes any biological, adoptive, or foster parent or stepparent of a child younger than age 18 who is living in the same household. The report includes data on demographics, marriage and relationship status, economics, and family formation and stressors. The following are some of the main findings: 18 percent of LGBTQ adults are parenting children. - 35 percent of married LGBTQ adults are parenting children. - 75 percent of LGBTQ parents are cisgender bisexual women (61 percent) and lesbian women (14 percent). - Approximately 5 million children are being raised by LGBTQ adults. - Regardless of age, LGBTQ adults are less likely to be parenting than non-LGBTQ adults. - LGBTQ parents are more likely to be living in poverty than LGBTQ non-parents and straight cisgender parents. - 78 percent of LGBTQ parents became parents through current or previous sexual relationships, 20 percent as stepparents, and 6 percent through adoption. - Approximately 30 percent of LGBTQ parents are not legally recognized or are unsure of their legal status as parents. - A discussion of the findings highlights policy implications. Lower rates of parenting among LGBTQ adults compared to non-LGBTQ adults may be a result of a lack of access to opportunities and resources to become parents. This suggests there is a need to address barriers to accessing reproductive technology and adoption services. Economic instability points to the need for policies and services that address economic inequities. There is also a need to recognize parental rights among LGBTQ parents, especially for those in same-sex couples who are not biologically related to their children. Explore the full report for more information about the demographics and characteristics of LGBTQ parents as well as policy and research implications.

> June 2016Vol. 17, No. 4Special Initiative: LGBTQ Pride Month June is Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and/or Questioning (LGBTQ) Pride Month. LGBTQ youth are overrepresented in foster care, making up a larger percentage of youth in care than in the general youth population. Research found that there are 13.6 percent LGBTQ-identified youth in foster care compared to 7.2 percent in the general youth population, and 5.6 percent transgender youth in foster care compared to 2.25 percent in the general youth population.1 Additionally, these youth face particular challenges in care or treatment that their peers may not. Only 13 States and Washington, DC, have laws that explicitly protect youth in foster care from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.2 Another seven States protect youth against sexual orientation discrimination only.3 Laws aren't the only places where these youth face discrimination—many may experience rejection, hurtful language, and a general lack of support from resource families and/or child welfare workers. The greater bias and discrimination they face can lead to negative outcomes, such as homelessness (56 percent), high levels of depression (six times more likely), or attempted suicide (eight times more likely).4 Parents, resources families, and child welfare professionals can help protect this vulnerable population by providing support and acceptance. Standing together with LGBTQ youth is one of the most valuable protective factors that someone can provide. There are many resources available for youth and concerned adults that provide advice, guidance, and information about mental and behavioral health, education, working with LGBTQ youth and families, and the particular risks these youth and families face.

Supporting and Affirming LGBTQ+ Children, Youth, and Families—July/August 2022 [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.cbexpress.acf.hhs.gov/article/2022/july-august/supporting-and-affirming-lgbtq-children-youth-and-families/4118feed1be01550bca18512f54bcba7)

> July/August 2022Vol. 23, No. 6Supporting and Affirming LGBTQ+ Children, Youth, and Families Written by the Capacity Building Center for States LGBTQ+* (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, and others) children and youth, particularly transgender youth, are overrepresented in foster care. Studies indicate that about 30 percent of youth in foster care identify as LGBTQ+, compared with 11 percent of youth not in foster care, and that approximately 5 percent of youth in care identify as transgender, compared with 1 percent of youth not in foster care (Youth.gov, n.d.). Affirming and supporting youth is always the right thing to do, and for LGBTQ+ youth, it can be lifesaving (Green et al., 2021; The Trevor Project, 2019; Turban et al., 2020). Even something as seemingly small as using a young person's preferred pronouns can have a tremendous impact on their well-being. The past few years have seen an uptick in anti-LGBTQ+ policies, including those that penalize parents for affirming and caring for their youth. While many county and district attorneys have pledged to decline to prosecute such cases, the damage and fear has already had traumatic effects for the young people who need gender-affirming care and for the families that want to support them. These are in addition to longstanding policies that limit the rights of LGBTQ+ children, youth, and families and fail to protect even the basic safety of LGBTQ+ youth. In fact, only a single state ensures youth in foster care are placed in bedrooms according to their gender identity. LGBTQ+ children and youth already navigating a landscape of harmful policies may find out-of-home care an exceptionally harrowing experience. What Can You Do to Better Support LGBTQ+ Youth and Families? Child welfare professionals can use the following strategies to ensure practice in their agencies supports LGBTQ+ youth and families. Read and Reflect on the Children's Bureau's Guidance In the March 2, 2022, The Family Room blog post, the Children's Bureau outlined its support for LGBTQ+ children and youth. That post and Information Memorandum (ACYF-CB-IM 22-01) describe how to provide safe, affirming care to LGBTQ+ youth and list related provisions in federal law for title IV-B and IV-E agencies. Agency leaders can explore ACYF-CB-IM-22-01 for resources and guidance regarding the use of federal funds for meeting the needs of LGBTQ+ children, youth, and families, such as using title IV-B funds to assist adoptive families in accessing gender-affirming health care for their children. Additionally, agencies can advocate for families at risk of being separated and can use title IV-E funds to promote family preservation. We must think broadly and innovatively to use federal programs and funds as anchors in serving all families and youth in foster care. Review Resources and Best Practices The following resources can support agencies working to build capacity to support and affirm LGBTQ+ children, youth, and families: Toolkit to Support Child Welfare Agencies in Serving LGBTQ Children, Youth, and Families (Center for States) - Creating LGBTQ Affirming Agencies Video and Guide (Center for States) - "Supporting and Affirming LGBTQ Children and Youth" [Webinar] (Center for States) - Affirming and Supporting LGBTQ Children and Youth in Child Welfare (Center for States) - Considerations for LGBTQ Children and Youth in Foster Care: Exploring Normalcy as It Relates to P.L. 113–183 (Center for States) - Working With LGBTQ+ Youth and Families [Webpage] (Child Welfare Information Gateway) - National SOGIE Center (University of Maryland) - Dedicate Time and Resources to Building a Safe and Supportive Culture Consider how to advance equity for LGBTQ+ youth by cultivating a culture that recognizes the intersectional identities that individuals hold. As with all diversity initiatives, agencies must be sure to include LGBTQ+ individuals when designing and implementing materials, education, training, and policies. Work to develop and model a culture that is open, accepting, and safe for LGBTQ+ children, youth, families, and staff. Consider how to demonstrate commitment to fostering an affirming environment by approaching different perspectives with curiosity and showing grace and encouragement to those who ask questions. Combine actionable policies and prioritized collaboration with LGBTQ+-affirming community partners to further align your practice and support your workers. To move forward and create or improve an LGBTQ+-affirming culture, take time to pause and reflect on current practice. Below are a few questions to explore when assessing your agency's policies and values so you might better engage and support LGBTQ+ youth and families in foster care: Are your policies intentional about assessing and providing each LGBTQ+ child's and youth's individualized needs? - Are you actively countering barriers to gender-affirming care? - Are you vigilant in placing LGBTQ+ children and youth in homes where they are wholly supported and celebrated? - Are you providing LGBTQ+ youth with opportunities to participate in activities that support their identity and development? - Are you actively building internal capacity to identify, understand, and address issues that LGBTQ+ youth encounter during their child welfare experience? - Are you prepared to provide trauma-competent and trauma-informed services? - Are you working to provide parents who are struggling to accept their child is LGBTQ+ with appropriate training and services? - Are agency staff supported, affirmed, and celebrated as their authentic selves? - Do agency materials, including the website, reflect a diverse representation of children, youth, and families? - References Green, A.

> Final Report " Acknowledgments This report, which summarizes findings from four case studies of Runaway and Homeless Youth Program grantees serving lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning youth, benefited from the contributions of many people. The case studies were conducted by Mathematica Policy Research and its subcontractor, the Williams Institute, under contract to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Office for Planning, Research and Evaluation (OPRE) in HHS’s Administration for Children and Families (ACF). The study would not have been possible without the support and cooperation we received from staff at all levels in each of the study sites. In addition to being extremely generous with their time while we were visiting each agency, staff responded to various follow-up questions. We are grateful for their participation. At ASPE and OPRE, Laura Radel, Seth Chamberlain, Sarah Sattelmeyer, and Akbar Hossain provided insightful guidance and comments during study planning, data collection, and reporting. In the early stages of the project, Sarah Oberlander and Kelsey McCoy offered helpful direction and feedback. We also benefited from input on study plans and assistance contacting study sites from Curtis Porter and Telisa Burt at ACF’s Family and Youth Services Bureau. Gregory Lewis of the True Colors Fund and Andre Wade of the National Alliance to End Homelessness offered feedback on study topics and site selection. At Mathematica, Diane Herz provided thoughtful comments on drafts of discussion guides and study reports. Jane Nelson and Jill Miller provided expert word processing and production support. We would like to thank all these individuals and organizations for their contributions to the study. Executive Summary Some government and private organizations are interested in improving services for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth who run away from home or experience homelessness. These efforts are prompted, in part, by research suggesting LGBTQ youth may be at greater risk for experiencing homelessness and, if they become homeless, more likely than their heterosexual counterparts to experience victimization, engage in high-risk sexual behaviors, and have poor mental health. To better understand provider experiences serving LGBTQ runaway and homeless youth (RHY), the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in collaboration with the Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation (OPRE) in HHS’s Administration for Children and Families (ACF), sponsored case studies of four local agencies receiving grants from ACF’s RHY Program. The purpose of the study, conducted by Mathematica and its subcontractor, the Williams Institute, was to learn about programs’ strategies for identifying and serving LGBTQ RHY, the challenges programs face in understanding and addressing the needs of this population, and potential areas for future research. The four study sites are federally funded RHY programs that provide a range of services, operate in different regions of the country, and have experience serving LGBTQ youth. They include agencies with urban and rural service areas in Colorado, Minnesota, Ohio, and Texas. One agency receives RHY Program funding for basic center services, two for transitional living, and two for street outreach. The share of clients identified as LGBTQ ranges from 5 to 28 percent. Drawing on site visit interviews as well as reviews of agency documents and forms, this report presents findings on four topics: (1) agencies’ collection and use of data on clients’ sexual orientation and gender identity, (2) providers’ assessment and perceptions of needs and capacities among LGBTQ RHY, (3) providers’ approaches to serving LGBTQ RHY, and (4) providers’ perceptions of research gaps and data needs related to services for LGBTQ RHY. We conclude by suggesting issues for policymakers and practitioners to consider related to collecting data on, and serving, this population. Collection and Use of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Data The study sites’ approaches to gathering information on sexual orientation and gender identity include asking direct questions on intake and assessment forms and relying on youths’ self-disclosure during less formal conversations with staff. Two of the four agencies collect information on sexual orientation through questions on intake or assessment forms completed by staff or youth. In three agencies, intake or assessment forms include questions on gender identity that feature response options for transgender status. Staff at all agencies reported using information on youths’ sexual orientation and gender identity when planning individual services. Staff use this information to tailor some services (such as referrals for counseling). In addition, staff use information on sexual orientation and gender identity (1) to determine housing and bathroom accommodations, (2) for assignment to case managers, and (3) in making appropriate health care referrals. No agencies reported that they analyze patterns of service use or outcome by sexual orientation and gender identity (or any other demographic characteristic). Agencies do not conduct these analyses because they do not record client-level sexual orientation or gender identity information in the agency’s management information system or other records, or because it is not their general practice to break down service use data by demographic group. The accuracy of data on the number of LGBTQ youth served at the agency level and reported to the federal government is uncertain and might vary widely among agencies. Factors that appear to affect complete or accurate collection of sexual orientation and gender identity data include youths’ reticence in answering questions, concerns among staff members about protecting youths’ privacy and recording these characteristics in agency records, and the absence in some agencies of standardized protocols for gathering sexual orientation or gender identity information. Assessment and Perceptions of Needs and Capacities of LGBTQ RHY Agency staff conduct assessments during initial intake sessions and subsequent meetings with youth to determine immediate needs, detail personal circumstances, and identify risk factors or barriers that may need to be addressed through longer-term services. Assessment tools used by some agencies inquire about sexual orientation and gender identity, but no agencies reported using tools that specifically target LGBTQ youth. Some staff reported that they assess needs or circumstances related to LGBTQ identity based on their own knowledge of these issues and techniques for exploring them with clients. Many staff felt that homeless youth face similar types of risks, regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity. Nevertheless, some types of risks—emotional distress and poor mental health, substance abuse and sexual risk behavior, and problems with family and personal relationships—were perceived to be particularly salient or frequent among LGBTQ youth. According to staff reports, LGBTQ youth of color and transgender youth are at the highest risk of encountering barriers to accessing appropriate services or resources, especially those related to health and employment. Staff also perceived some distinctive protective factors among LGBTQ youth. In particular, LGBTQ youth may be “survivors” who develop positive self-protection skills after experiencing stigma and rejection. Approaches to Serving LGBTQ RHY All agencies visited implement some organizational strategies that focus on LGBTQ youth, including adopting nondiscrimination and nonharassment policies and protecting the confidentiality of information shared by youth. Agencies differ in the extent to which they have implemented other organizational strategies, such as establishing a safe and affirming environment, developing staff skills in serving LGBTQ youth, and creating partnerships with other organizations serving LGBTQ youth. Opportunities to improve cultural competency in serving LGBTQ youth ranged from annual trainings on site in two agencies to occasional attendance at sessions offered at universities or conferences for staff at another agency. Agencies also tailor a variety of services to make them more accessible or relevant to the needs and circumstances of LGBTQ youth. For example, agencies tailored housing programs to the needs of LGBTQ youth by assigning shared accommodations based on self-reported gender identity and providing private accommodations, when available, to address youths’ concerns about safety. These approaches were perceived to be especially helpful for transgender youth who could be concerned about sleeping in male or female dormitories. Two agencies offered services specifically for LGBTQ youth. One agency employs an LGBTQ case manager who develops individual service plans for LGBTQ-identified youth in its housing programs. Another operates a host home program specifically for LGBTQ youth, matching these youth with LGBTQ-supportive adults who offer youth transitional housing in private homes. Staff in two agencies reported that they aim to facilitate reconciliation between LGBTQ youth and families when possible, but that such assistance is offered only to the extent a youth wishes to engage with her or his family. Agency staff did not report that efforts at family acceptance for LGBTQ youth are based on a formal intervention model. Rather, staff use general mediation strategies in their attempts to work with families. Two factors that appear to affect tailoring of services to LGBTQ youth are the presence of staff with LGBTQ expertise and the perceived proportion of youth served who identify as LGBTQ. Having staff with appropriate expertise and a visible LGBTQ clientele may encourage agencies to take steps to better serve this population. Challenges that can impede efforts to improve or tailor services for LGBTQ RHY include (1) a lack of local resources that focus on LGBTQ youth; (2) the difficulty of overcoming social stigma, especially toward LGBTQ youth of color and transgender or gender-nonconforming youth; and (3) staff concerns about singling out a specific population of RHY while still being able to help all youth who need an agency’s services. Research Needs We asked staff in case study agencies to identify the kinds of information and research that might help them understand the characteristics and experiences of LGBTQ RHY more completely and provide effective services to this population. Staff recommended future research in six general areas: - Size of the LGBTQ RHY population in local areas. According to agency staff, community-level data on the number of RHY who identify as LGBTQ would help agencies understand whether they are reaching this population successfully. These data also may help them gauge whether current services align with the characteristics of the local RHY population. - Characteristics of subpopulations of LGBTQ youth. Staff perceived transgender youth (including transgender youth of color) and LGBTQ RHY of color in general to be at particularly high risk of poor outcomes, but little is known about the proportion of the RHY population these youth comprise, the specific risk factors prevalent among them, or their outcomes. - Risk and protective factors among LGBTQ RHY. Staff members pointed to three risk factors that appear to be prevalent among LGBTQ RHY and could be better understood: (1) types and severity of mental health disorders, (2) prevalence and factors contributing to human trafficking and sexual exploitation, and (3) prevalence of intimate partner and dating violence among LGBTQ RHY. According to staff, experiences among LGBTQ youth also have the potential to support development of protective factors or personal capacities. In particular, resiliency among LGBTQ homeless youth may increase as they learn to contend with discrimination. - Factors contributing to LGBTQ youth homelessness. Additional research on the reasons LGBTQ youth become homeless would help providers identify and address the potentially varied and distinct factors contributing to this problem. - Experiences of LGBTQ youth involved in multiple systems. Homeless youth may be involved in several public systems, especially the juvenile justice and child welfare systems. Staff in case study agencies indicated a need for information on the perceptions of these systems among LGBTQ RHY and efforts to link across systems to better serve this population. - Service models and administrative strategies that focus on LGBTQ RHY. Agency staff frequently expressed a need for intervention models targeting LGBTQ RHY and information on the effectiveness of these interventions in various service contexts (for example, urban or rural areas). Staff mentioned a particular interest in models for promoting family engagement and reunification and positive youth development among LGBTQ youth. Issues for Policymakers and Practitioners The case study findings point to four issues related to serving LGBTQ RHY for policymakers and practitioners to consider: - Ensuring consistency and accuracy in data collection. To improve the consistency and accuracy of administrative data on these topics, it may be beneficial to offer providers guidance on preferred content for questions about sexual orientation and gender identity and recommended methods for asking them. Providers also may need to consider whether different processes might be used to collect data for administrative purposes (for example, to understand the demographics of an agency’s clientele overall) and for guiding service provision. Collecting administrative data anonymously (for example, through an online questionnaire) would allow an agency to gather data on the number of youth who identify as LGBTQ without asking youth to disclose the information to a staff member during an initial intake session or assessment. To help staff plan services appropriately, they could record in individual case files any information gathered later about a youth’s LGBTQ status. - Management and analysis of data on LGBTQ identity. In addition to standardized practices for asking questions on sexual orientation and gender identity, guidance on when this information should be recorded in case records, as well as on when and to whom it should be disclosed, may benefit agencies. Programs might also benefit from information on how analyzing data by demographic characteristics might be used for assessing service delivery, and from assistance to build capacity for internal data management and analysis. - Technical assistance for agencies whose service areas lack extensive LGBTQ resources. Offering technical assistance or training on LGBTQ issues regularly and making it easily accessible via online participation would help agencies in areas without access to local LGBTQ resources. Another option would be to create opportunities for RHY providers to share information on strategies for serving LGBTQ RHY, perhaps by creating an online repository for documents on best practices. - Developing and evaluating interventions targeting LGBTQ youth. RHY providers will likely benefit from specification, dissemination, and evaluation of models for serving LGBTQ youth effectively. Evaluations of program models targeting LGBTQ RHY might explore whether the models are most effective when offered as separate program components or as modifications to services available to RHY in general. Studies might also address the effectiveness of tailoring specific types of services, such as family reunification support or individual counseling, to the particular needs and circumstances of LGBTQ RHY. I. Introduction Research suggests that young people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning their sexuality (LGBTQ) face a disproportionate risk of homelessness. Available data on youth homelessness are limited and not nationally representative, but studies of homeless youth served by individual providers or in local areas have found that 6 to 35 percent identify themselves as LGBTQ (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration 2011).1 In comparison, analyses of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health found that 7.4 percent of boys and 5.3 percent of girls in grades 7–12 reported same-sex romantic attraction, and results of a recent nationally representative survey of U.S. adults indicate that approximately 3.4 percent identify as LGBT (Russell et al. 2001; Gates and Newport 2012). According to a study of a representative sample of high school students in one state, lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth and heterosexual youth who have same-sex sexual partners are 4 to 13 times more likely than exclusively heterosexual youth to be homeless (Corliss et al. 2011). Providers serving homeless youth also report that LGBTQ youth are overrepresented among the youth they serve. Respondents to a national nonrepresentative survey of providers estimated that LGBTQ youth comprise 40 percent of their clientele, on average (Durso and Gates 2012). Homeless LGBTQ youth also might be more likely than their heterosexual counterparts to experience victimization, engage in high-risk sexual behaviors, and have poor mental health. Several studies have found that lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth are more likely than heterosexual youth to (1) have been physically or sexually victimized, (2) engage in survival sex or sex work, (3) have attempted suicide, (4) use illicit substances, and (5) have greater mental health concerns (Cochran et al. 2002; Van Leeuwen et al. 2006; Ray 2006; Toro et al. 2007; Tyler 2008). Although these studies are not representative of the entire homeless youth population, considered together, they suggest that LGBTQ homeless youth are at high risk of poor outcomes. In response to these indications of higher prevalence of homelessness among LGBTQ youth and potentially greater risks for those experiencing homelessness, government and private organizations have suggested approaches for enhancing services for LGBTQ youth in out-of-home care (see, for example, National Alliance to End Homelessness et al. 2009; Wilber et al. 2006; Ray 2006; SAMHSA n.d.). Common suggestions include the following: - Establishing nondiscrimination, antiharassment, and confidentiality policies that address sexual orientation and gender identity, and creating safe and inclusive agency environments - Enhancing LGBTQ cultural competency among staff through training and other supports - Providing flexible and tailored programming for LGBTQ youth, including interventions that focus on family acceptance and reunification - Addressing the unique health and shelter needs of transgender clients - Establishing connections with other community organizations serving LGBTQ youth - Collecting data on LGBTQ youth receiving services and using these data to educate decision makers and assess patterns in service provision and outcomes Some agencies serving homeless youth have already accomplished one or more of these suggested steps. Agencies that serve primarily LGBTQ homeless youth operate in several large cities and tailor many services to this population.2 The Williams Institute’s Homeless Youth Provider Survey (HYPS) gathered information from 354 organizations nationwide on their experiences providing services to homeless LGBTQ youth. Approximately 24 percent of services and activities offered by agencies responding to the survey targeted LGBTQ clients (Durso and Gates 2012).3 In addition, 85 percent of survey respondents agreed with the statement, “I am very knowledgeable about LGBT homeless youth,” indicating they believe themselves competent to work with this population (Durso and Gates 2012). Yet much remains to be learned about whether and how agencies serving runaway and homeless youth (RHY) implement practices to address the specific needs or circumstances of LGBTQ youth. To better understand provider experiences serving LGBTQ RHY, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in collaboration with the Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation (OPRE) in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), HHS, sponsored case studies of local agencies receiving grants from ACF’s RHY Program. The purpose of the study, conducted by Mathematica and its subcontractor, the Williams Institute, was to learn about programs’ strategies for identifying and serving LGBTQ RHY, the challenges programs face in understanding and addressing the needs of this population, and potential areas for future research. The study addressed four sets of questions: - What are providers’ approaches to collecting and using data on the sexual orientation and gender identity of the youth they serve? What information do providers collect, and when? Do providers use data on sexual orientation or gender identity to tailor services to individual clients or assess program performance? What challenges do providers experience in collecting data on LGBTQ RHY? - What do providers perceive to be the key needs and capacities of LGBTQ RHY? How do programs assess these needs and capacities? Do program staff perceive differences in needs and capacities of LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ youth? - What strategies do providers implement in working with LGBTQ RHY? How, if at all, do organizations tailor their services to LGBTQ RHY? What successes and challenges have providers experienced providing services to these youth? - What research gaps affect providers’ ability to understand and meet the human service needs of LGBTQ RHY? What data or information are needed to provide services more effectively to this population? The study aimed to document agency experiences and staff perspectives among a select group of RHY Program grantees, rather than to identify best practices in serving LGBTQ RHY. Two government initiatives related to services for LGBTQ youth inform the study questions. The first is the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) Framework to End Youth Homelessness, which prioritizes improving (1) data collection and quality; and (2) providers’ capacity to serve especially vulnerable groups, including LGBTQ youth (USICH 2013). (We describe the USICH Framework in more detail later in this chapter.) The second initiative is an OPRE project to develop a research agenda on the human service needs of LGBT populations.4 The case studies provided an opportunity to gather input from providers on research priorities related to LGBT populations, especially homeless youth. Key Terms: Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, Gender Expression, and Transgender According to the American Psychological Association (2011): - Sexual orientation refers to “the sex of those to whom an individual is sexually and romantically attracted” and generally includes the categories lesbian, gay, bisexual, and heterosexual. - Gender identity refers to “one’s sense of oneself as male, female, or transgender.” - Gender expression is “the way a person communicates gender identity to others through behavior, clothing, hairstyles, voice, or body characteristics.” - Transgender is a broad term describing people whose self-identified gender or gender expression does not correspond to their biological sex or sex assigned at birth. Next, we describe the RHY Program and other key federal efforts related to youth homelessness, site selection criteria and characteristics of the four case study sites, data collection methods, and the organization of the rest of the report. 1 The ages of young people in these studies vary. For this study, we adopt the definition of youth that the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) uses: people up to 24 years old. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Program of the Administration for Children and Families, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services serves youth up to 22 years old. A. The RHY Program and Other Federal Responses to Youth Homelessness Because homeless youth can be involved in many public systems (such as child welfare, juvenile justice, and homeless assistance), many policies and programs can affect them. With respect to shelter, housing, and outreach services for RHY, key elements of the federal policy and program context include the RHY Program structure, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funding for homeless services, and the USICH Framework to End Youth Homelessness. We describe each of these next. RHY Program. The federal RHY Program, administered by the Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) in ACF (part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services), funds community-based organizations and shelters serving young people. The program makes annual grants totaling more than $100 million to support four types of direct services: - Basic center. Basic center grantees provide up to 21 days of emergency shelter to youth under age 18, along with counseling to support the return of youth to their families, if appropriate. - Transitional living and maternity group homes. These grants support longer-term housing (up to 21 months), such as supervised apartments and host home programs, in which youth live in the homes of screened and trained adult volunteers. Transitional living programs offer supportive services to youth ages 16 to 22 to promote self-sufficiency and social and emotional well-being. Some transitional living grants fund housing for pregnant and parenting youth. As with other transitional living programs, maternity group homes offer services to make it easier to transition to self-sufficiency, but they also offer parenting skills training. - Street outreach. Street outreach grantees contact youth living on the streets to build relationships, provide basic living supplies, and offer information on shelters and other services. The primary goal of such programs is to protect youth and prevent sexual exploitation or other harm. In addition to direct services, the RHY Program supports the National Runaway Safeline, which connects youth in crisis to available services, and a training and technical assistance network for RHY grantees.5 FYSB requires grantees of the RHY Basic Center and Transitional Living programs to report semiannually the number and demographics of youth they serve, the types of services provided, and the status of youth when they exit RHY programs. Grantees record and submit these data to the federal government through the Runaway Homeless Youth Management Information System (RHYMIS), a database created for this purpose. Agencies create entry and exit records for each youth served, including youth who reenter services. Entry records document the young person’s (1) demographic characteristics, (2) living situation at entry, (3) referral source, (4) school status, and (5) involvement in the child welfare or juvenile justice system. Exit records document (1) youths’ “critical issues” or needs identified by program staff, including issues related to sexual orientation or gender identity; (2) services provided to youth, (3) plans for providing transitional support or referrals after program exit, and (4) youths’ living situation at exit. RHYMIS records include fields for reporting the sexual orientation and gender identity of clients served, among other demographic characteristics. This feature distinguishes RHYMIS from the administrative databases of other ACF programs, which do not collect information on participants’ sexual orientation or gender identity. According to the RHY Program’s 2010-2011 Report to Congress, among youth whose sexual orientation was reported in RHYMIS, lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth accounted for 6 or 7 percent served in the Basic Center Program and 9 or 10 percent served in the Transitional Living Program during fiscal years 2010 and 2011 (HHS 2013). Transgender youth accounted for less than 1 percent of youth served in each program during these years (HHS 2013). However, the Report to Congress notes that RHYMIS data may underreport the percentage of youth served who are LGBT, since youth are not always asked these questions or do not always provide responses to them. (We discuss additional challenges related to data collection on sexual orientation and gender identity in Chapter II.) HUD homeless assistance programs. Many programs serving homeless youth receive funding from multiple government and private sources, including HUD. HUD homeless assistance programs support emergency shelter, supportive services, transitional housing, homelessness prevention, and other services through Continuum of Care (CoC) awards to coalitions of nonprofit organizations, State agencies, and/or local government agencies operating in a specific geographic area. HUD awarded $1.67 billion in CoC grants in fiscal year 2012. Lead agencies receiving CoC awards may subaward funds to individual service providers. This approach to funding is intended to promote collaborative planning and service delivery among agencies that address the various needs of homeless people in a local area. HUD requires most agencies receiving CoC awards or subawards to implement a Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) to collect and report on client characteristics and services provided in their local areas. Some agencies also use HMIS as an internal case management system. HUD does not require that HMISs report clients’ sexual orientation and gender identity, but agencies may choose to collect such data through their locally developed HMIS. USICH Framework to End Youth Homelessness. The USICH is an independent agency within the federal executive branch whose mission is to coordinate the federal response to homelessness and to create partnerships to reduce and end homelessness in the nation. The USICH’s 2010 strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness established a goal of ending homelessness among children, families, and youth by 2020 (USICH 2010). In February 2013, USICH released a framework proposing two strategies for addressing youth homelessness: (1) improving data collection; and (2) improving the capacity of federal, state, and local systems that serve youth experiencing homelessness or at risk of becoming homeless (USICH 2013). Both strategies have implications for providers serving LGBTQ youth. The first strategy focuses on creating systems to gather and communicate accurate information on the number and circumstances of homeless youth. It emphasizes such steps as including youth in point-in-time counts of the homeless population, integrating or coordinating federal information systems that record data on homeless youth receiving services, and undertaking national studies to address information gaps regarding the number and characteristics of homeless youth. As one step in this strategy, USICH and several other federal agencies have launched Youth Count!, an effort to identify promising methods for counting unaccompanied homeless youth in local areas. Improved data on homeless youth will incorporate information on key subpopulations, including LGBTQ youth. The framework’s second strategy is to create and disseminate an intervention model for serving homeless youth and helping them achieve desired outcomes: stable housing, enhanced connections with sources of social support, increased participation in education or employment, and improved health and well-being. The preliminary model posits screening and assessment, followed by provision of services (housing or shelter, mental or physical health care, and social supports) matched to youth circumstances and risk levels (USICH 2013). A key principle of the model that USICH proposes is that services should be culturally appropriate and tailored to youth characteristics, including sexual orientation and gender identity. 5 For additional information on the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program, please see the program’s most recent Report to Congress (http://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/fysb/rhy_congress_2010_11.pdf). B. Site Selection and Characteristics In selecting study sites, we aimed to identify federally funded RHY programs that provide a range of services, operate in different regions of the country, and have experience serving LGBTQ youth. We used three main criteria to identify potential case study sites: - Receipt of RHY funding. Because the study focuses on HHS-funded service providers, we included only agencies that had received RHY basic center, transitional living, or street outreach grants in 2012. - Participation in the HYPS.6 We limited candidates to agencies that responded to the HYPS. This narrowed the number of potential sites and increased access to data about each site. In addition, participation in the survey signaled that at least one person at each agency was interested in issues facing LGBT-identified homeless youth. - Experience serving LGBTQ youth. To ensure we could address questions regarding approaches to serving LGBTQ-identified youth, we aimed to identify sites with relevant experience. We established two indicators of this experience: (1) the agency offers services expressly for LGBTQ-identified youth and/or (2) the agency reported in the HYPS that it serves LGBTQ youth. In addition to the screening criteria, we specified agency characteristics that would help us assess whether sites varied in ways that might influence an agency’s service approaches and the challenges it faces in serving LGBTQ youth. These characteristics included the agency’s size in terms of staff and budget, types of services provided, and geographic location. Drawing on a variety of information sources, including the HYPS and agency websites, we developed a list of 10 potential sites. After consultations with ASPE and OPRE, as well as discussions with representatives of the RHY Program and advocacy organizations that focus on homeless youth, we selected four sites for inclusion in the study. The selection of the four sites prioritized (1) diversity among the agencies in size, reported proportion of youth served who are LGBTQ, and urban or rural service area; (2) inclusion of some agencies that had not participated in previous studies of RHY providers; and (3) inclusion of all three types of RHY Program grantees. Table I.1 summarizes characteristics of the study sites. (Appendix A includes a brief profile of each site.) The group includes agencies with urban and rural service areas in four states: Colorado, Minnesota, Ohio, and Texas. The agencies employ from 19 to 65 staff members and serve from 157 to as many as 2,550 youth annually. One agency receives RHY Program funding for basic center services, two for transitional living, and two for street outreach. The share of clients identified as LGBTQ ranges widely, from 5 to 28 percent. (These figures, based on staff estimates or agency reports, were not always consistent with the data provided in response to the HYPS or reported to RHYMIS; we present percentages reported by program staff or in program documents.) Two of the agencies offer services designed specifically for LGBTQ homeless youth: a host home program and a designated LGBTQ case manager. Table I.1.

C. Data Collection Methods During spring 2013, the research team completed calls and visits to the four selected sites. Two team members spent a day and a half at each agency, conducting semistructured individual and group interviews with five types of respondents: (1) executive directors; (2) program supervisors; (3) direct service staff, such as case managers; (4) evaluation specialists or database administrators (in programs with such staff members); and (5) representatives of partner organizations working with the selected agencies to serve LGBTQ youth.7 In addition, we asked contacts at each site for information on the number of RHY served annually and client demographics, including the proportion of youth identifying as LGBTQ. Finally, we requested copies of intake and assessment forms and documents describing agency services (such as annual or evaluation reports). Our review of case study data included preparation of site visit summaries and team discussions to develop findings. After each site visit, researchers prepared two documents: (1) an initial memo identifying broad findings and (2) a detailed summary of information gathered on each research topic and subtopic. As researchers prepared these documents, they compared responses of individual agency staff members to confirm information or identify divergent views. The entire research team reviewed the memos and detailed summaries and, during structured discussions focusing on the research topics, identified key findings and practices within and across the four sites. 7 We did not gather information from youth receiving services, due to limitations on the number of interviews conducted for this study.

Organization of this Report The rest of this report is organized into the following sections, addressing each of the study’s research questions: - Chapter II presents findings on whether and how providers collect and use client data on sexual orientation and gender identity. - Chapter III describes how programs conduct assessments of RHY; whether assessments take LGBTQ identity into account; and staff perceptions of risk factors, needs, and capacities among LGBTQ RHY. - Chapter IV outlines providers’ approaches for serving LGBTQ youth, especially organizational-level strategies and service tailoring. - Chapter V summarizes RHY program staff perspectives on data gaps and research needs related to services and outcomes for LGBTQ RHY and discusses issues for policymakers and practitioners to consider related to collecting data on, and serving, this population. II. Agencies’ Collection and Use of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Data Understanding the number and characteristics of homeless youth is important for policy and planning at the provider, local, and national levels. Reliable data on who experiences homelessness can help researchers identify population groups that are at higher risk. Providers can consider information on the size and characteristics of the local homeless youth population to assess whether service capacity and offerings align with the number and circumstances of homeless youth in their communities. Data on the homeless youth population can also help raise awareness of this problem and help local and national stakeholders allocate resources for responding to it. Funders, including the RHY Program, require providers to collect and report information so the funders will know who benefits from programs they support. Yet barriers exist to collecting accurate information on the characteristics of homeless youth, especially their sexual orientation and gender identity. As a vulnerable population, homeless youth can be difficult to locate or hesitant to share information about themselves with service providers or researchers. Questions on sexual orientation and gender identity are likely to be particularly sensitive for young people, who may fear harassment by peers and others, or have concerns that information will be disclosed to their families. Such fears or concerns may result in inaccurate responses to questions or refusals to answer. Adolescents also may have trouble responding to questions on these topics because they are in the midst of sexual and gender identity development (Sexual Minority Assessment Research Team 2009; Austin et al. 2007; Saewyc et al. 2004). In addition, the multifaceted nature of sexual orientation and gender identity creates challenges to gathering this information through standardized forms or surveys (Sexual Minority Assessment Research Team 2009). Sexual orientation may refer to a person’s self-identification, sexual behavior, or sexual attraction. Gender identity—a person’s innate sense of being male, female, or transgender—includes a range of experiences, from expressing gender in a manner that may or may not conform to societal expectations to medical interventions to change one’s sex. These complexities require attention to question wording, response options, and modality, so that respondents interpret questions consistently and provide accurate information. In this chapter, we review the experiences of case study sites in collecting and using demographic data, especially sexual orientation and gender identity, on the homeless youth they serve. Our study found the following: - Two of the four agencies collect information on sexual orientation through questions on intake or assessment forms completed by staff or youth, and all agencies sometimes gather this information when youth share it during less structured interactions. In three agencies, intake or assessment forms include questions on gender identity that feature response options for transgender status. - Staff at all agencies reported using information on youths’ sexual orientation and gender identity when planning individual services, but no agencies examine program-level service delivery or outcome data by any demographic characteristics (including sexual orientation and gender identity, race/ethnicity, or others). - Factors that appear to affect complete or accurate collection of sexual orientation and gender identity data include youths’ reticence in answering questions, concerns among staff members about recording these characteristics in agency records, and the absence in some agencies of standardized protocols for gathering sexual orientation or gender identity information. A. Approaches to Collecting and Recording Data on Youth Demographics Agencies collect demographic information on youth during initial intake sessions and subsequent meetings or conversations with youth. Staff conducting intake sessions for shelter or housing services use forms to gather such information as a youth’s name, age, birth date, race and ethnicity, disability and marital status, and last permanent address. These forms can be completed by staff through interviews with youth or completed by youth themselves. Staff members reported that they also gather information on youths’ backgrounds during case management meetings and informal conversations that occur after intake, once youth and staff have had an opportunity to build rapport. As would be expected, services that involve extended contact between staff and youth allow for collection of more comprehensive demographic data than services featuring briefer and less consistent interactions. Information is regularly gathered from youth accessing emergency shelter or transitional housing, which tend to require formal enrollment procedures and regular case management meetings. For street outreach or drop-in center services, staff complete logs to document contacts with youth and attempt to record basic information, such as name, age, physical characteristics, and living situation. Because these service contacts tend to be brief, however, opportunities for additional data collection may be limited. To record and manage client data, three study agencies use an HMIS and one maintains paper records. All the agencies use RHYMIS to report client and service data for programs receiving federal RHY grants, but RHYMIS is not used as a tool for ongoing case management. At agencies using an HMIS, staff reported that they duplicated entry of information into RHYMIS to meet reporting requirements. B. Collection and Use of Information on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity The study sites’ approaches to gathering information on sexual orientation and gender identity include asking direct questions on intake and assessment forms and relying on youths’ self-disclosure during less formal conversations with staff. Staff at all agencies reported that they consider sexual orientation and gender identity information, when it is available, in planning services for individual clients. Collection of sexual orientation and gender identity data. Two of the four study sites systematically collect and record data on the sexual orientation of youth enrolling in shelter programs, using questions specified on agency forms. The format and placement of questions differ between the two agencies. One agency collects this information through an item on its intake form (see Box II.1, Agency A). The form does not specify question phrasing but does indicate response categories: (1) heterosexual, (2) bisexual, (3) gay, (4) lesbian, (5) questioning, and (6) self-identified orientation. Sources: Intake and assessment forms provided by study sites and RHYMIS forms for entrance to basic shelter and transitional living programs. Note: One of four study sites does not collect information on sexual orientation or gender identity on intake forms. RHYMIS = Runaway and Homeless Youth Management Information System. The second agency includes a single, combined question on sexual orientation and gender identity on its health risk assessment form (Box II.1, Agency B): “What is your sexual orientation and/or gender identity?” Response options for this question include (1) heterosexual (straight), (2) homosexual (gay or lesbian), (3) bisexual, (4) transgender, or (5) gender confused.8 All options that apply can be selected. Three agencies gather gender identity information (including transgender status) on intake or assessment forms. In addition to the agency that uses a combined sexual orientation/transgender status question, two agencies ask separate questions about gender identity (Box II.1, Agencies A and C). Response categories are similar for these two agencies’ questions and include (1) male; (2) female; (3) male-to-female transgender; (4) female-to-male transgender; and (5) other, don’t know, or refusal. In general, these categories align with the gender identity item in RHYMIS. One agency (Agency C) that collects information on gender identity does not collect information on sexual orientation. Staff at this agency indicated that they prefer not to ask about sexual orientation at intake, allowing youth to provide that information later if they choose. Agency staff do inquire about transgender status, however, to ensure that they offer appropriate housing options to clients. In all sites, agencies developed phrasing for questions and response categories internally, rather than using outside resources for guidance. The phrasing includes nonspecific response options, such as self-identified orientation and other, to accommodate the wide range of replies youth provide to these questions. In general, staff offer clients the option to refuse to answer questions about sexual orientation and gender identity, but some reported taking special steps to collect the information when appropriate. For example, one staff member noted that she would ask youth to mark the appropriate box on an intake form (rather than completing it herself) if the youth seemed reluctant to respond verbally. Other staff noted that they conducted intake interviews in private offices to offer confidentiality for potentially sensitive topics. Staff from agencies not collecting information on sexual orientation at intake noted that, with this approach, youth can share this information later, or not at all. Study participants at all agencies concurred that some youth discuss their sexual orientation or gender identity only after building a relationship with a staff member. Referrals from partner organizations may also suggest that a youth is LGBTQ (for example, when youth are referred to shelter services by an LGBT community organization). Use of information on sexual orientation and gender identity. Many staff providing direct services indicated that they consider the sexual orientation or gender identity of individual youth as they create service plans. Staff use this information to tailor some services (such as referrals for counseling). In addition, staff use information on sexual orientation and gender identity (1) to determine housing and bathroom accommodations, (2) for assignment to case managers, and (3) in making appropriate health care referrals. We describe these approaches to service tailoring further in Chapter IV. Staff consider information on the sexual orientation and gender identity of individual youth to be sensitive but reported they would discuss it internally when it was pertinent to planning or coordinating services. Staff in one agency also noted that information on LGBTQ identity might be communicated between partner agencies when considered relevant to a referral. In contrast, another agency took a stricter approach to information disclosure, emphasizing that clients should be in control of whether such information is shared. Staff at this agency typically do not reveal clients’ sexual orientation or gender identity to providers outside the agency, unless legally required to do so. Agencies also use data on sexual orientation and gender identity for grant and annual reporting, including reporting to FYSB through RHYMIS. The two agencies that systematically collect sexual orientation information at intake present summaries of this information, along with other client demographics, in annual or evaluation reports. No sites reported assessing patterns of service use or outcome by sexual orientation and gender identity. Agencies do not conduct these analyses because they do not record client-level sexual orientation or gender identity information in the agency’s MIS or other records, or because it is not their general practice to break down service use data by demographic group. Some staff members expressed interest in demographic analyses but noted that limited resources constrain their agencies’ capacity for data analysis and management. Others questioned whether exploring potential differences in service experiences among demographic groups could promote segmenting of services for specific RHY populations, in contrast to efforts to meet the needs of all RHY or identify and address the unique circumstances and needs of each individual youth. 8 We did not determine the criteria used to identify gender-confused clients. C. Challenges and Considerations in Data Collection and Interpretation Agencies’ experiences collecting information on sexual orientation and gender identity of youth highlight factors that may affect data completeness and accuracy. They also suggest issues for policymakers and other stakeholders to consider when interpreting sexual orientation and gender identity data on RHY. Community context, agency reputation, and youths’ personal interactions with staff appear to influence whether youth answer questions on sexual orientation and gender identity. Staff at one agency noted that youth in their service area generally do not have difficulty responding to questions on sexual orientation or gender identity. Staff speculated that the agency’s urban location and its reputation as welcoming to LGBTQ people likely contribute to youths’ comfort revealing their LGBTQ identities. Staff from several agencies affirmed that a clearly welcoming environment encourages LGBTQ youth to seek services and increases the likelihood they will be open about issues of sexual orientation and gender identity. Training in LGBTQ issues, which may give staff members more comfort addressing these topics, may also support youth reporting of sexual orientation or gender identity. In contrast, staff working at another agency noted that community mores appeared to discourage youth from revealing their sexual orientation and gender identity, even to staff who identify as LGBTQ. In all sites, staff highlighted the importance of establishing a rapport with youth to facilitate communication on sensitive issues, including sexual orientation and gender identity. Concerns about risk of disclosure make some staff reluctant to collect data on sexual orientation and gender identity. Although staff across agencies generally agreed that collection of data on sexual orientation and gender identity could be useful for service provision, they voiced differing opinions about whether an agency ought to collect this type of information. Some staff members reported few concerns about collecting, documenting, or disclosing sexual orientation or gender identity data, as long as agency guidelines on confidentiality were followed. However, one agency director noted that a tension exists in administrative data collection between the public’s desire for information and the agency’s interest in maintaining the privacy of its clients. A few staff members across agencies voiced the view that reporting data on the sexual orientation and transgender identity of youth served should be optional for programs, since clients may not feel safe sharing this information. A minority of staff at RHY providers and their partner agencies expressed concern that information, particularly on youth under age 18, could be disclosed outside the agency. For example, a representative of one partner agency serving homeless minors noted that the agency could be required to release information in case files to parents or child welfare officials without the consent of the youth involved. Such disclosure could create problems for young people whose families might not accept their sexual orientation or gender identity, or for youth referred to a child welfare agency perceived to be unsupportive of LGBTQ youth. Staff members at another agency described their service area as socially conservative and voiced concern that disclosure of a youth’s sexual orientation or gender identity could result in harassment by others in the community. For that reason, staff preferred not to push youth to share such information. The presentation of questions on sexual orientation and gender identity affects how data are collected and can be interpreted. Staff from an agency that incorporates sexual orientation and gender identity questions on its intake form affirmed that the inclusion of such questions encourages routine collection of these data. In agencies without clear protocols for asking about sexual orientation or gender identity, staff members’ skills influence whether and how these data are collected. One direct service provider observed that the absence of specific sexual orientation and gender identity questions on the agency’s intake or assessment forms places the burden on the staff member to initiate a conversation and phrase questions appropriately. The success of the process then relies heavily on the provider’s comfort level with, and knowledge of, LGBTQ issues. When agencies include sexual orientation and gender identity questions on forms, they do not always use similar question formats. Some agencies include an “other” category, for example, to accommodate those who wish to avoid labels or embrace a fluid concept of sexuality. In addition, questions and response options in agency forms are not always consistent with items in RHYMIS. Agencies’ current approaches may support identification of individual LGBTQ clients and estimates of the size of the LGBTQ population served at the agency level. However, because agencies do not use standardized questions or response categories, and response modalities to these questions vary (questions may be self-administered or asked by staff during an interview), caution is required in comparing reported proportions of LGBTQ youth among agencies or aggregating data across them. Information on LGBTQ identification and information gathered after initial intake sessions or assessments is not likely to be recorded in agencies’ management information systems (MIS). Agencies that record information on sexual orientation and gender identity usually do so during intake sessions or initial assessments with youth. Some youth seeking services might not wish to disclose their sexual orientation or gender identity during early contacts with staff, and others might not yet be developmentally ready to articulate their sexual orientation or gender identity. Therefore, agency information systems are not likely to reflect information on sexual orientation and gender identity shared after these early contacts. Moreover, staff in three of the four case study agencies reported that it is not uncommon for LGBTQ-identified youth to change how they describe their sexual orientation or gender identity while they participate in services. Staff adjusted to these transitions (for example, by changing pronouns used to refer to a youth). However, they usually did not update any demographic data initially collected from youth and stored in their agency’s records or MIS. The accuracy of RHYMIS data on the number of LGBTQ youth served is uncertain and might vary widely among agencies. Staff in sites that collect and record information on sexual orientation, gender identity, or both believed that statistics reported to RHYMIS accurately indicate the number of youth willing to disclose their LGBTQ identity during intake sessions. However, they noted that RHYMIS data probably underreport the number of LGBTQ youth served, because (1) not all programs within agencies include intake processes that address sexual orientation and gender identity and (2) youth were not always willing to provide responses to questions on LGBTQ identity. In sites that do not have systematic processes for collecting or recording information on sexual orientation or gender identity, data on LGBTQ identification reported in RHYMIS are also likely to be incomplete and based on staff estimates. III. Assessment and Perceptions of Needs and Capacities of Lgbtq Runaway and Homeless Youth The USICH intervention model for homeless youth identifies screening and assessment of youth as a first step toward targeting services appropriately. Assessments identify risk factors, which are “problematic symptoms, behaviors, and associations” that may contribute to poor outcomes, and protective factors, which are “positive skills, attitudes, behaviors, and associations” that counteract the effects of risk (U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness 2012).9 According to the model, assessments should help providers determine how long a youth has been homeless (because a longer time on the streets is likely to put youth at higher risk), the risk factors that services should mitigate, and the protective factors that should be enhanced. LGBTQ homeless youth may experience different patterns of risk from other homeless youth. One study of homeless youth in Seattle, for example, found that LGBT youth exhibit mental health or behavioral issues at higher rates than heterosexual youth, including such traits as delinquency, aggression, and withdrawn behavior (Cohran et al. 2002). Another survey found that lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth in six states were more likely than non-LGB youth to engage in survival sex and substance abuse (Van Leuuwen et al. 2006). LGBTQ youth also may be more likely to experience rejection by parents, which contributes to youth homelessness (Quintana et al. 2010). According to existing research, transgender people, including youth, appear to face widespread discrimination in employment and housing, and tend to have difficulty accessing safe and appropriate shelter when homeless (Grant et al. 2011; Mottet and Ohle 2003). LGBTQ youth may also benefit from protective factors in distinct ways. Support of friends and family may be especially important for youth who are sexual minorities. According to one study, this type of support positively affects measures of well-being among LGB youth, with family support, in particular, associated with reduced mental distress (Shilo and Savaya 2011). In another study, perceptions of social support, a sense of being connected to other people, and self-esteem in being part of a larger community (such as the LGBT community) were linked to psychological well-being among LGB youth (Detrie and Lease 2007). An emerging area of research focuses on the potential for resiliency—the ability to overcome challenges or trauma—to lessen the psychological harm that LGBT victims of harassment or violence may experience. Our discussions with agency staff explored approaches to conducting assessments of homeless youth and addressing issues of sexual orientation and gender identity in this process. To better understand service provider perceptions, we also asked staff about the risks or needs exhibited among LGBTQ youth they serve, and how, in their experience, they compare between LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ youth. We found the following: - Assessment tools may help staff explore risks or needs related to LGBTQ identity, but these issues are more often addressed during less structured discussions with youth. - Many staff felt that homeless youth face similar types of risks, regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity. Nevertheless, some types of risks—emotional distress and poor mental health, substance abuse and sexual risk behavior, and problems with family and personal relationships—were perceived to be particularly salient or frequent among LGBTQ youth. - According to staff reports, some LGBTQ youth encounter barriers to accessing services or resources that may enhance protective factors, including health and employment. These barriers may be especially high for transgender youth. 9 Risk factors specified in the USICH model include (1) trauma, (2) emotional distress, (3) sexual risk behavior, (4) family problems, (5) criminal or delinquent behavior, and (6) substance abuse. Protective factors specified include (1) family cohesion and support, (2) school engagement or employment, (3) survival skills, (4) positive connections, (5) positive future expectations, (6) decision-making skills, (7) self-esteem and self-efficacy, and (8) health. A. Addressing LGBTQ Identity in Assessments Agency staff conduct assessments during initial intake sessions and subsequent meetings with youth. These assessments focus on triaging to determine immediate needs, detailing personal circumstances, and identifying risk factors or barriers that may need to be addressed through longer-term services. Intake forms gather information on such topics as (1) living situation and reasons for homelessness; (2) physical and mental health status; (3) education history; (4) employment history and income; (5) involvement with other agencies (such as child welfare or juvenile justice); (6) experience with domestic violence; and (7) needs for food, shelter, and identification. Subsequent meetings, such as conversations between youth and licensed mental health staff, may address a broader range of issues and include more detailed assessments of risks and needs related to mental health status, experience with abuse or neglect, and substance abuse. Some agencies’ assessment tools address sexual orientation and gender identity, but no agencies reported using tools that specifically target LGBTQ youth. Questions on life skills or health assessments can prompt discussion of issues related to LGBTQ identity. For example, according to staff at one agency, administration of the Casey Life Skills Assessment, which includes a question on comprehension of sexual orientation and gender identity concepts, sometimes leads to further conversations about these topics.10 Another agency’s health risk assessment form includes a question on sexual orientation and gender identity. This question helps staff put into context later items addressing safer sex practices and may also trigger discussions with youth about concerns related to sexual orientation or gender identity development. Some staff reported that they assess needs or circumstances related to LGBTQ identity based on their own knowledge of these issues and techniques for exploring them with clients. For example, one staff member reported that she discusses sexual orientation and gender identity development milestones during individual meetings with youth, if these topics are of concern. With LGBTQ-identified youth, she inquires whether and to whom youth have disclosed their LGBTQ status, and, if so, the kinds of responses they have received. 10 The Casey Life Skills Assessment is a self-administered or interview-based questionnaire that assesses youths’ behaviors, knowledge, and awareness in eight life skill areas. Youth indicate whether statements presented in the tool “are like me” using a five-point scale. Under the Relationships and Communication area, the assessment presents the statement, “I can explain the difference between sexual orientation and gender identity.” For more information about this tool, see: http://www.casey.org/Resources/Tools/cls/default.htm. B. Perceptions of Needs, Risks, and Capacities of LGBTQ RHY In general, staff in case study agencies did not perceive major differences in the types of risks faced by LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ RHY. However, they did indicate that certain risks may be especially frequent among LGBTQ RHY or have distinctive contributing factors. For example, staff at one agency explained that they provide services using a trauma-informed perspective to understand how experiences of violence, abuse, and other adverse experiences shape all youths’ thoughts, feelings and behaviors. Although all RHY are likely to have experienced trauma, among LGBTQ RHY, these experiences may be connected with negative responses to the youths’ sexual orientation or gender identity from family, peers, and others. Agency staff considered several risk factors to be salient for LGBTQ RHY. Although data are not available to confirm whether these risks affect LGBTQ youth disproportionately in case study agencies, staff perspectives concur with findings from existing research (summarized in the introduction to this chapter). Risk factors highlighted by staff include the following: - Emotional distress, poor mental health, and substance abuse. Staff in all case study agencies perceived that LGBTQ RHY often contend with issues related to mental health. At two sites, staff reported that LGBTQ youth are more frequently referred than other youth for mental health treatment. Emotional distress among LGBTQ RHY may be a result of life trauma intensified by negative reactions from family and community to disclosure of sexual orientation, gender identity, or both. Staff noted that LGBTQ RHY appear to be likely to exhibit signs of depression, heightened anger and issues with conflict resolution, and uncertainty around identity development. Staff also reported that LGBTQ RHY frequently experience problems with drug or alcohol abuse, a perception consistent with findings from previous research. - Sexual risk behavior and sexual exploitation. A few staff members noted a propensity among LGBTQ RHY to engage in risky sexual behavior and face exposure to sexually transmitted infections, a perception supported by analyses of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (Kann et al. 2011). This pattern may be linked to a general tendency among youth to take risks, but studies also have found an association between stressors related specifically to gay, lesbian, or bisexual sexual orientation (such as social isolation or victimization) and high-risk sexual behavior and other problem behaviors (Rotheram-Borus et al. 1995). Similar factors may contribute to problems LGBTQ RHY experience related to sexual exploitation, including human trafficking, which staff at one agency perceived to be more common among LGBTQ youth than other youth they serve. - Family problems, relationship issues, and intimate partner violence (IPV). Staff in all agencies indicated that LGBTQ RHY are likely to have endured family and social rejection, sometimes directly linked to their sexual orientation or gender identity. However, a few expressed caution about assuming that family conflict is the primary driver of LGBTQ youth homelessness, which can also result from families’ difficult economic circumstances or parents’ personal issues. LGBTQ RHY may also have general difficulty forming trusting relationships, according to some staff, possibly because of experiencing IPV, an absence of adult role models, or efforts to avoid disclosing their sexual orientation or gender identity. Some staff members highlighted IPV, in particular, as a problem among LGBTQ RHY. Indeed, results of one study of violence and abuse within dating relationships among a sample of 5,647 middle- and high-school youth in three states confirms this impression. The study found that lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth were at elevated risk for dating violence victimization and perpetration, compared to their heterosexual peers, and that transgender youth were more likely than non-transgender male or female youth to be victimized and to perpetrate violence (except psychological abuse) (Dank et al. 2013). Staff also mentioned risks relevant to subpopulations of LGBTQ youth, particularly transgender youth and youth of color. Staff in one agency felt that it was sometimes difficult when working with transgender youth to balance youths’ understandable focus on gender transition with the need to address other concerns, including housing and employment. Transgender youth also were perceived to be at particular risk of emotional distress resulting from discrimination or harassment, both by peers and within the larger community. Staff in two agencies noted that LGBTQ youth of color face particular obstacles related to family and community acceptance. Staff shared the impression that minority racial and ethnic communities may be more likely to be connected to cultural or religious institutions that are not supportive of LGBTQ people and that LGBTQ youth in these communities may be likely to experience rejection by families and others as a result. These impressions echo findings in other research indicating that LGBTQ youth who are racial or ethnic minorities encounter challenges in family and community relationships. One study of Latino and non-Latino LGBT young adults, for example, found that Latino families, immigrant families, and families with high religious involvement were less likely to be accepting of LGBTQ youth (Ryan et al. 2010). In another study, representatives of schools and community organizations working with LGBT youth of color in Los Angeles indicated that gay, bisexual, and transgender male youth may have difficulty accessing services in racial or ethnic minority communities where religious organizations are prominent providers, due to stigma or prejudice (Durso et al. 2013). According to agency staff, experiences among LGBTQ youth have the potential to support development of protective factors or personal capacities. In particular, resiliency among LGBTQ homeless youth may increase as they learn to contend with discrimination. Staff perceived LGBTQ youth to be “survivors” who develop self-protection skills after experiencing stigma and rejection. LGBTQ youth may also build resiliency by successfully connecting with other youth who share their sexual orientation or gender identity. C. Service and Resource Barriers Affecting LGBTQ Youth To enhance protective factors for RHY, agency staff attempt to provide or link youth with services that address identified needs and mitigate risks. Staff in case study agencies noted that some LGBTQ youth face barriers in accessing services or opportunities that may be important for achieving positive outcomes. Staff commonly mentioned barriers to two resources in particular: - Health care. Staff noted that LGBTQ youth face challenges accessing care to address their unique health needs. Youth may find it difficult to locate health care providers who are knowledgeable about LGBTQ issues and prepared to discuss the particular risks LGBTQ youth face. Transgender RHY seeking assistance with gender transition may be unable to access this type of care. Staff in three of the four sites visited indicated that they face challenges trying to locate health care providers with expertise serving transgender people in their area. - Employment. Staff also reported that LGBTQ RHY tend to encounter distinct obstacles to employment. Employers are not always accepting of LBGTQ youth, especially those whose gender expression does not conform to societal expectations. LGBTQ youth, and transgender youth in particular, may also experience harassment from fellow workers, decreasing their motivation to maintain employment. Some agencies take steps to mitigate these barriers as they provide services to LGBTQ RHY. We describe these efforts in Chapter IV. IV. Approaches to Serving Lgbtq Runaway and Homeless Youth Research suggests that barriers to service access for LGBTQ youth result from societal, provider, and youth factors (Acevedo-Polakovich et al. 2011). Social stigma and prejudice may negatively influence providers’ attitudes toward LGBTQ youth. Providers’ lack of knowledge about LGBTQ youth or difficulty identifying them might reduce their ability to deliver appropriate services to these populations. In addition, youth might be reluctant to access services because of their own fears of rejection or concerns about personal safety if their LGBTQ status is disclosed. Agencies serving RHY have taken steps to reduce access barriers for LGBTQ youth and ensure their programs address risks LGBTQ youth are likely to face. These steps may include organizational changes to improve the safety and friendliness of the overall service environment for LGBTQ youth, increase staff skills in serving these populations, and enhance access to relevant local resources. Agencies also tailor individual services in an effort to increase their accessibility and effectiveness for LGBTQ youth. As a whole, such strategies may support a key element of the USICH intervention model for homeless youth: matching interventions (including treatment, housing, and skill-building programs) to the characteristics of subgroups of youth and individual youth. We explored the types of strategies case study agencies had implemented and the challenges and successes they encountered in doing so. Our discussions with staff distinguished between (1) strategies that focus on the organization as a whole and (2) adjustments to the delivery of specific services. We found the following: - All agencies we visited implement some organizational strategies that focus on LGBTQ youth, including adopting nondiscrimination and nonharassment policies and protecting the confidentiality of information shared by youth. - Agencies differ in the extent to which they have implemented other organizational strategies, such as establishing a safe and affirming environment, developing staff skills in serving LGBTQ youth, and creating partnerships with other organizations serving LGBTQ youth. - Agencies tailor a variety of services to make them more accessible or relevant to the needs and circumstances of LGBTQ youth. Adjustments to emergency shelter and physical and mental health services are common. - Challenges that affect efforts to improve services for LGBTQ RHY include (1) lack of local resources that focus on LGBTQ youth; (2) difficulty of overcoming social stigma, especially toward LGBTQ youth of color and transgender or gender-nonconforming youth; and (3) staff concerns about singling out a specific population of RHY, while continuing to help all youth who need an agency’s services. A. Organizational Strategies We explored agencies’ implementation of six main organizational strategies for serving LGBTQ RHY, focusing on recommendations frequently made in publications addressing service provision to these populations: (1) adopting policies prohibiting discrimination and harassment, (2) protecting the confidentiality of information about youth, (3) establishing a safe and affirming service environment, (4) developing staff cultural competency, (5) hiring staff with relevant expertise, and (6) partnering with other organizations serving LGBTQ youth (National Alliance to End Homelessness et al. 2009; Wilber et al. 2006; Ray 2006). Table IV.1 presents key examples of the implementation of each of these strategies in the case study sites. Table IV.1.

Adoption of nondiscrimination and nonharassment policies inclusive of sexual orientation and gender identity. A clear and widely communicated statement that an agency does not discriminate or tolerate harassment based on sexual orientation or gender identity is believed to establish an institutional framework for inclusion (National Alliance to End Homelessness et al. 2009). All case study agencies maintained written nondiscrimination and nonharassment policies that mentioned sexual orientation and gender identity. Agencies communicated these policies to staff through employee handbooks and other agency documents. Some agencies took additional steps to communicate and implement these policies. For example, one reported that the statement of client rights youth receive includes a pledge of services free of discrimination. Staff at another agency noted that they might restrict access to their drop-in center for youth who violate policies by harassing others based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Protection of confidential information. Practices to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information can help protect LGBTQ youth from potential harm and address concerns that information they share will be disclosed to others without their permission. All agencies reported that their policies and procedures ensure the privacy of client information within guidelines established by federal, state, and local laws. No staff members indicated that their agencies had established specific policies or practices regarding the recording or disclosure of LGBTQ status information. Rather, information on sexual orientation and gender identity, when available, is generally handled in the same way as other private data, such as health information. Staff in one agency reported that they may disclose a youth’s LGBTQ status to partner organizations if the youth has provided consent. Establishing a safe and welcoming service environment. Providing a space that is free of bullying and harassment, and that positively supports homeless youths’ LGBTQ identity, can be a key factor in facilitating service access (National Alliance to End Homelessness et al. 2009). To achieve this goal, all agencies we visited take steps to provide youth safe and appropriate accommodations in shelters or transitional living arrangements. These steps include (1) arranging for some youth to sleep in a private area if they do not feel comfortable in a male or female dormitory, (2) offering private rooms to all youth, and (3) establishing a written agency policy specifying that youth are to be assigned to dormitories based on their gender identification or offered the option of a private room if safety is a concern. Other steps signal that agencies offer a space welcoming to LGBTQ youth. For example, some agencies display posters featuring images of LGBTQ youth or “Safe Zone” signs communicating that staff are open to discussing issues of sexual orientation and gender identity. Staff at one agency created a reading corner featuring books and other materials on LGBTQ-related subjects. Staff who identify as LGBTQ may also promote a welcoming environment by serving as role models and helping to create a sense of community for LGBTQ youth. Finally, staff in two agencies reported that they quickly intervene to address any instances of harassment based on sexual orientation or gender identity observed in their facilities. Developing LGBTQ cultural competency. Staff members’ LGBTQ cultural competency—their ability to understand the perspectives of LGBTQ people and communicate effectively with them—is likely to influence the quality of their interactions with LGBTQ RHY and youths’ willingness to use agency services (National Alliance to End Homelessness et al. 2009; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, n.d.). Agencies reported that they attempt to improve cultural competency through staff trainings on LGBTQ issues. Training methods and frequency varied among sites. Staff in one agency indicated that they occasionally access LGBTQ cultural competency training through local universities or conferences for RHY providers. Two other agencies offer an annual in-house training that addresses topics relevant to serving LGBTQ youth, including nonharassment and antidiscrimination policies, appropriate use of language (such as identifying youth with the name or gender pronouns they prefer), and strategies for creating a safe and inclusive environment for youth. In addition, individual staff members sometimes served as experts on LGBTQ issues within an agency, providing training or informal consultation to their colleagues. Involving staff with expertise serving LGBTQ youth. Agencies can use hiring processes to identify job candidates with expertise on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity or screen candidates for their openness to working with LGBTQ youth. Sites do not intentionally recruit LGBTQ employees, but all the sites currently have staff who identify as LGBTQ. One manager reported that her agency communicates its nondiscrimination policy to job candidates, and interviews include questions to assess applicants’ experiences with LGBTQ people. Another indicated that knowledge of LGBTQ issues could be considered an important qualification for some agency positions. According to staff in two agencies, board members familiar with the LGBTQ community can also be an important resource for information and organizational partnerships that will improve service delivery to sexual minority and transgender youth. Partnering with organizations serving LGBTQ people. Partnerships with other organizations working with LGBTQ people can help RHY providers link youth to appropriate services and sources of social support. All study sites pursue such relationships. Some partnerships enable referrals to professional organizations that target a broad population but are competent in providing such services as health care and employment assistance to LGBTQ youth. (We describe partnerships to help youth access specific types of services later in this chapter.) These links sometimes feature sharing of information about individual clients through case management contacts, which was perceived to strengthen relationships between agencies and support effective service provision. Staff in three sites refer youth to LGBTQ-specific organizations for social or support groups. For example, staff in one agency reported that they work with a local LGBTQ community center to facilitate the participation of LGBTQ RHY in PrideFest events and youth activities. Some organizational strategies, especially creating a safe and welcoming environment and developing cultural competency among staff, seemed to require relatively more effort for agencies to implement. Staff in two agencies emphasized that offering a hospitable environment for LGBTQ youth depends on establishing an overall agency culture or philosophy promoting respect for diversity and inclusion. Agency managers must embrace this philosophy, and it must be constantly reinforced among employees and youth to foster consistently welcoming and respectful spaces. Staff in another agency noted that opportunities and resources for participating in LGBTQ cultural competency training locally were limited. In addition, one staff member believed that cultural competency skills are difficult to maintain if agency workers have infrequent interactions with LGBTQ-identified youth. In addition, the limited availability of LGBTQ-specific resources in a community might constrain sites’ ability to connect youth with organizations offering LGBTQ-related services. Staff from two agencies noted a dearth of groups that focus on the LGBTQ community in their service areas. Although both these organizations identified partners able to address the mental health or employment needs of LGBTQ youth, it was more difficult for them to connect youth with supportive, in-person social groups outside the RHY agency. The other two agencies were able to cultivate partnerships to access services offered by multiple LGBTQ organizations in their cities, such as a drop-in center for LGBTQ youth, transgender-specific health care, and resources to prevent sexual exploitation or human trafficking among LGBTQ youth. B. Tailoring Services to LGBTQ RHY As a group, the agencies we studied offer examples of methods for tailoring a variety of services to make them accessible and potentially effective for LGBTQ youth. We discussed with staff their approaches to providing seven types of services to LGBTQ RHY: (1) street outreach; (2) housing, including emergency shelter and transitional living; (3) drop-in centers; (4) physical health care; (5) mental health care; (6) education and employment assistance; and (7) counseling to promote family acceptance or reunification. Table IV.2 presents examples of approaches to tailoring services in each category. Street outreach. According to staff reports, agencies’ approaches to providing street outreach services generally do not differ markedly for LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ youth. However, outreach staff at one agency reported that they display pink triangles or rainbow flags (widely recognized symbols of the gay rights movement) on buttons or clothing to communicate that they are LGBTQ-friendly. Emergency shelter and transitional living. Agencies tailored housing programs to the needs of LGBTQ youth by assigning shared accommodations based on self-reported gender identity and providing private accommodations, when available, to address youths’ concerns about safety. These approaches were perceived to be especially helpful for transgender youth who could be concerned about sleeping in male or female dormitories. One agency provides private rooms to all youth receiving emergency shelter housing; staff saw this arrangement as important to promoting safety and respect in accommodations for all clients. Case managers at two agencies reported helping shelter-housed youth organize discussion groups on LGBTQ issues, including sexual identity development, internalized homophobia, and relevant current events. In addition, two agencies offered services specifically for LGBTQ youth in housing programs. One agency employs an LGBTQ case manager who develops individual service plans for LGBTQ-identified youth in its housing programs and creates opportunities for youth to participate in social and educational programs, including a performance group. In addition, one agency operates a host home program specifically for LGBTQ youth, matching these youth with LGBTQ-supportive adults who offer youth transitional housing in private homes. Drop-in center. Two case study agencies operate a drop-in centers for RHY. Neither center targets LGBTQ youth specifically, but staff at one agency described efforts to maintain a safe environment for all youth. These include mediating conflicts and quickly addressing incidents of harassment based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Staff at this agency have also organized ad hoc discussion groups to help youth educate one another about issues of sexual orientation and gender identity. Physical health care. Agencies’ partnerships with other providers helped them access physical health services relevant to LGBTQ youth. For example, one site maintains a referral relationship with an organization offering support groups for transgender people and a shot clinic where health care providers can help clients with hormone injections. Staff in two agencies reported that they have identified community providers that are culturally competent in addressing the health care needs of LGBTQ youth. Table IV.2.

Mental and behavioral health counseling and treatment. Agencies offer tailored mental health care services by employing professionals with expertise in counseling LGBTQ youth and establishing referral relationships with outside providers. In three agencies, staff reported that some in-house staff are qualified to provide psychological counseling to RHY who express concerns about sexual orientation or gender identity development. In addition, staff at three agencies reported that they regularly refer RHY to outside providers with experience offering mental and behavioral health services to LGBTQ youth. For example, one agency connects youth to an agency providing substance abuse treatment and an empowerment and social networking program aimed at reducing sexual risk-taking among LGBTQ youth. Education and employment assistance. Staff in all sites reported offering tailored assistance for seeking employment to LGBTQ youth, by working with youth, employers, or both. Staff in one agency reported that they advise some LGBTQ youth to consider personal presentation when applying for job opportunities with employers that are “mainstream.” This approach reflected circumstances in a socially conservative service area. Staff in three other agencies reported that they or their agency partners work proactively to identify LGBTQ-friendly work environments by gauging employers’ comfort in hiring LGBTQ youth. For example, job development staff might inform potential employers that the RHY agency’s clientele includes LGBTQ youth. Staff in one agency reported providing education to both employers and youth on how to address potential or actual coworker conflicts related to sexual orientation or gender identity. Staff in three sites indicated that securing employment for LGBTQ RHY of color and transgender RHY can be especially challenging. According to these staff members, racial or ethnic minority youth and transgender youth may confront multiple types of stigma and prejudice that generally increase the difficulties they face in achieving self-sufficiency. Staff reported using strategies similar to those described above to serve these youth populations. Counseling for family acceptance/reunification. Staff in two agencies reported that they aim to facilitate reconciliation between LGBTQ youth and families when possible, but that such assistance is offered only to the extent a youth wishes to engage with her or his family. Agency staff did not report that efforts at family acceptance for LGBTQ youth are based on a formal intervention model. Rather, staff use more generalized counseling strategies and techniques for reaching out to families. Staff highlighted challenges inherent in this work, including difficulties accessing family members and some families’ reluctance to pursue reunification. In an agency that serves both minors and young adults, staff reported that many older youth are not interested in engaging with their families. In that case, staff work with youth to explore the possibility of reconnecting with their families in the future. Two factors that appear to be linked to agencies’ tailoring of services to LGBTQ youth are the presence of staff with LGBTQ expertise and the perceived proportion of youth served who identify as LGBTQ. LGBTQ specialists appear to help agencies remain attentive to LGBTQ youths’ specific needs, offering case management services, facilitating discussion groups, organizing social or recreation opportunities, and coordinating housing services that focus on LGBTQ youth. They also consult with other staff members on issues related to serving this population. A perceived demand for tailored services may also prompt agencies to consider how to better address the needs of LGBTQ youth. In a case study agency with a small estimated proportion of LGBTQ-identified youth, fewer types of services are tailored. Staff at this agency noted that they would consider tailoring more services or offering LGBTQ-specific services if LGBTQ youth comprised a larger share of the agency’s clientele. Although tailoring of services was common among the agencies, some staff members raised concerns about offering separate services targeting LGBTQ RHY. These concerns might reflect an emphasis on meeting the needs of all RHY and not favoring a specific group. A few staff members also worried that allocating funding to LGBTQ-specific services might reduce the resources available for serving the RHY population as a whole. Yet even staff who expressed the opinion that LGBTQ youths’ needs and risk factors are generally the same as the broader population of RHY offered examples of ways their agencies adjust some services to address the specific circumstances LGBTQ RHY. This suggests that staff generally accept that LGBTQ RHY may benefit from distinct service approaches. V. Research Needs and Issues for Policymakers and Practitioners Agencies are taking steps to meet the needs of LGBTQ RHY, based on guidance issued by advocacy and professional organizations, staff expertise, and experience working with this population. However, much remains to be learned about the characteristics and experiences of LGBTQ RHY, including how many LGBTQ youth are homeless, the reasons they become homeless, and the nature of risk and protective factors among them. Moreover, limited data sources currently exist to explore these issues. Staff in study sites identified many specific information gaps and potential directions for future research. In addition, the case studies point to several issues regarding data collection and services for LGBTQ RHY for policymakers and program managers to consider. A. Data Gaps and Research Needs We asked staff in case study agencies to identify the kinds of information and research that might help them understand the characteristics and experiences of LGBTQ RHY more completely and provide effective services to this population. Staff recommended future research in six general areas: (1) the size of the LGBTQ RHY population in local areas, (2) characteristics of subpopulations of LGBTQ RHY youth, (3) risk and protective factors among LGBTQ RHY, (4) factors contributing to LGBTQ youth homelessness, (5) experiences of LGBTQ youth involved in multiple systems, and (6) service models that focus on LGBTQ RHY. Size of the LGBTQ RHY population in local areas. According to agency staff, community-level data on the number of RHY who identify as LGBTQ would help agencies understand whether they are reaching this population successfully. These data also may help them gauge whether current services align with the characteristics of the local RHY population. New efforts to enumerate the homeless population may provide some of this information. For example, HUD requires that communities receiving funding conduct annual point-in-time counts of the number of homeless people in shelters and transitional housing and, every other year, of people who are unsheltered. In 2013, these counts will be reported by age categories, including under age 18 and ages 18 to 24, for the first time. In addition, the federal Youth Count! initiative, which is testing strategies for developing accurate counts of unaccompanied homeless youth, may eventually provide the resources to help communities and agencies to gather accurate data. The Youth Count! initiative includes a focus on highly vulnerable subpopulations and has provided guidance to participating cities on asking youth questions about their sexual orientation and gender identity. Characteristics of subpopulations of LGBTQ youth. Agency staff members expressed an interest in better understanding the characteristics, experiences, and needs of transgender youth (including transgender youth of color) and LGBTQ RHY of color in general. Although staff perceived these subpopulations to be at particularly high risk of poor outcomes, little is known about the proportion of the RHY population these youth comprise, the specific risk factors prevalent among them, or their outcomes. Researchers studying these subpopulations often encounter challenges related to limited sample sizes, but qualitative studies with relatively small numbers of participants may still shed light on potentially distinct circumstances or needs among transgender RHY and racial or ethnic minority LGBTQ RHY. In addition, staff suggested that research would be helpful on the particular challenges that LGBTQ RHY in rural areas face. Understanding how these youth navigate such barriers as a lack of transportation and few nearby LGBTQ organizations may help providers better reach and serve them. Risk and protective factors among LGBTQ RHY. Staff members pointed to three risk factors that appear to be prevalent among LGBTQ RHY and could be better understood. First, agency staff indicated a need for additional information on the types and severity of mental health disorders among LGBTQ RHY and appropriate services for addressing them in the context of RHY programs. Second, LGBTQ RHY may be at higher risk than non-LGBTQ youth for human trafficking and sexual exploitation. Staff suggested that more research is needed to understand the prevalence of these problems, which youth are most at risk, and why youth enter into relationships that are considered exploitative. This information might help practitioners and researchers identify strategies to prevent youth from being exploited. Third, staff noted that additional information is needed on the prevalence of relationship violence among LGBTQ RHY. Research exploring factors that put LGBTQ youth at risk for intimate partner violence, level of conflict management skills among LGBTQ RHY, and strategies to promote violence prevention would be helpful. In addition, research on promoting resilience among LGBTQ RHY would support efforts to enhance protective factors among these youth. Factors contributing to LGBTQ youth homelessness. Studies of youth who have run away from home suggest that family stability or lack of parental support, disengagement from school, depression, and substance abuse are among the factors that directly or indirectly increase youths’ risk of running away. (Tucker et al. 2011; Tyler et al. 2011). However, it is not known how family, environmental, and individual factors might affect the likelihood of running way for LGBTQ youth specifically. Although family rejection due to sexual orientation or gender identity is believed to contribute to homelessness among LGBTQ youth, a few staff members at case study agencies noted that is not always the case in their experience. These staff shared anecdotes of LGBTQ RHY who remained connected to their families, who did not reject them based on sexuality or gender identity, but simply could not provide for them. Additional research on the reasons LGBTQ youth become homeless would help providers identify and address the potentially varied and distinct factors contributing to this problem. Experiences of LGBTQ youth involved in multiple systems. Homeless youth may be involved in several public systems, especially the juvenile justice and child welfare systems. Staff in case study agencies indicated a need for information on the frequency of involvement in more than one system among LGBTQ RHY and youths’ experiences in these programs. For example, it may be useful to understand whether LGBTQ youth perceive some systems to be more safe and welcoming, or how youths’ interactions with staff in one system—such as developing a supportive relationship with a case manager—may influence their outcomes in another. It may also be helpful to learn more about any linking of efforts across systems to serve LGBTQ RHY. For example, research could explore whether aligning training for LGBTQ cultural competency across systems addresses concerns among RHY staff that other agencies may not be welcoming of LGBTQ youth. Service models and administrative strategies that focus on LGBTQ RHY. Agency staff frequently expressed a need for intervention models targeting LGBTQ RHY and information on the effectiveness of these interventions in various service contexts (for example, urban or rural areas). Staff mentioned a particular interest in models for promoting family engagement and reunification and positive youth development among LGBTQ youth. In addition, staff noted that it would be helpful to identify models that ameliorate risks and enhance protective factors among transgender RHY and LGBTQ RHY of color. With respect to administrative strategies, some staff members noted that additional information on LGBTQ cultural competency training for RHY providers would be helpful. According to these staff members, it would be useful to identify how frequently such training should be delivered and strategies for helping staff retain cultural competency skills after training. B. Issues for Policymakers and Practitioners to Consider The case study findings point to four issues related to serving LGBTQ RHY for policymakers and practitioners to consider: (1) ensuring consistency and accuracy in collecting data on clients’ sexual orientation and gender identity, (2) providing guidance on management and analysis of these data, (3) providing technical assistance to agencies whose service areas lack extensive LGBTQ resources, and (4) developing and evaluating interventions relevant to LGBTQ RHY. Ensuring consistency and accuracy in data collection. Data collection practices in case study agencies indicate that not all RHY Program grantees systematically collect and record information on sexual orientation and gender identity. Among case study agencies that do collect these data, the content of questions on agency forms varies. As a result, comparisons of data across organizations are likely to be difficult. In addition, agencies collect information at different times. To improve the consistency and accuracy of administrative data on these topics, it may be beneficial to offer providers guidance on preferred content for questions about sexual orientation and gender identity and recommended methods for asking them. This advice could draw on recommendations for survey questions addressing these topics (see, for example, Sexual Minority Assessment Research Team 2009). In addition, clear communication to RHY program staff about why this information is needed would likely promote more consistent data collection efforts. Providers also may need to consider whether separate processes are necessary to collect data for administrative purposes (for example, to understand the demographics of an agency’s clientele overall) and for guiding service provision. This distinction might help agencies collect more accurate counts of LGBTQ youth served. For example, one representative of a partner agency suggested that agencies might address youths’ potential reticence to share information on LGBTQ identity by collecting data through an anonymous online questionnaire administered to youth seeking assistance. This mode would allow an agency to gather data on the number of youth who identify as LGBTQ without youth being asked to disclose the information to a staff member during an initial intake session or assessment. To help staff plan services appropriately, they could record in individual case files any information gathered later about a youth’s LGBTQ status. Management and analysis of data on LGBTQ identity. In addition to standardized practices for asking questions on sexual orientation and gender identity, agencies may benefit from guidance on when this information should be recorded in case records, as well as on when and to whom it should be disclosed. This type of guidance could help address program staff members’ concerns about the risk of disclosure, which may discourage them from collecting data on LGBTQ status. Procedures for RHY programs could be modeled on existing guidance for child welfare professionals (Wilber 2013). Among case study agencies that collect demographic data on youth, none analyze these data to explore whether services received differ among demographic groups. Such analyses could help agencies identify and address disparities that may exist between LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ youth or among subpopulations of LGBTQ youth. Agencies might not examine data in this way because (1) they lack the staff resources, (2) disaggregating service data by demographic group is not the agency’s general practice, or (3) their data systems do not support these types of analyses. Programs might benefit from examples of how disaggregated data can be used for assessing service delivery. They might also require assistance building capacity for internal data management and analysis. Technical assistance for agencies whose service areas lack extensive LGBTQ resources. Developing cultural competency among staff members and identifying community resources to help serve LGBTQ RHY were particularly challenging for agencies in places without an extensive network of LGBTQ organizations. One option for addressing this challenge is to offer technical assistance or training on LGBTQ issues regularly and make it easily accessible via online participation. Another would be to create opportunities for RHY providers to share information on strategies for serving LGBTQ RHY, perhaps by creating an online repository for documents on best practices. Developing and evaluating interventions targeting LGBTQ youth. RHY providers will likely benefit from specification, dissemination, and evaluation of models for serving LGBTQ youth effectively. FYSB is providing support for identifying LGBTQ-specific interventions through grants to help build capacity among RHY providers in serving LGBTQ youth. Rigorous evaluations of interventions targeting LGBTQ RHY could help identify models that are effective for these populations. Evaluations of program models targeting LGBTQ RHY might explore whether the models are most effective when offered as separate program components or as modifications to services available to RHY in general. Studies might also address the effectiveness of tailoring specific types of services, such as family reunification support or individual counseling, to the particular needs and circumstances of LGBTQ RHY. C. Themes in Study Findings The case studies suggest that approaches to identifying and serving LGBTQ youth are likely to range widely among RHY providers. Key themes in study findings include the following: - Among practitioners we interviewed, there did not appear to be general agreement on the need or approaches for collecting and using information on clients’ sexual orientation and gender identity. Recommendations for collecting these data while respecting youths’ privacy and additional information on the potential uses of the data could help providers take steps to better understand the LGBTQ RHY population. - Staff perceive that LGBTQ youth generally face risk factors similar to those of non-LGBTQ youth but also note that the frequency of these risks and circumstances contributing to them may differ for the two populations. In addition, transgender youth and LGBTQ youth of color may face distinctive patterns of risk. These issues could be explored further through future research. - Some recommended steps for serving LGBTQ RHY may be implemented more readily than others. For instance, adopting policies prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity may be relatively easy for agencies to accomplish, but establishing safer and more welcoming environments, increasing cultural competency among staff, and linking LGBTQ youth to appropriate services may require more sustained effort. In addition, some practitioners appear to be uncertain about the appropriateness of targeting a specific subpopulation of RHY by tailoring services or developing programs especially for them. As agencies are encouraged to address the needs of LGBTQ RHY, providers may benefit from support for implementing practices that have been recommended to promote positive outcomes among these youth.

> LGBTQI+ Community Members and Disaster Preparedness and Response Topic Collection June 6, 2024 Topic Collection: LGBTQI+ Community Members and Disaster Preparedness and Response Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) communities continue to be disproportionately affected by disasters and mass casualty incidents (MCIs) because of preexisting disparities, historical marginalization, and discrimination. To combat these disparities, emergency planners can incorporate LGBTQI+ people into planning processes and include LGBTQI+ measures in health surveillance. LGBTQI+ community support is an important driver of better outcomes after a disaster. With this in mind, local, state, and federal responders can consider partnering with local LGBTQ+ organizations to ensure LGBTQI+ people are meaningfully included in health care and the highest standards of culturally competent care are provided in all settings. Emergency shelters can provide safe and accessible environments that serve the whole community, including LGBTQI+ people by adopting nondiscrimination policies, making gender-neutral bathrooms available, using correct names and pronouns, and prioritizing privacy and confidentiality where possible. LGBTQI+ people are in all communities, at all ages. Planners might therefore consider how LGBTQI+ resources and policy considerations can be integrated into population specific planning efforts, such as planning efforts that focus on older adults or children, youth, and families. This Topic Collection (TC) includes resources for LGBTQI+ individuals; lessons learned from recent public health emergencies, MCIs, and natural disasters; tools for planning; resources for emergency planners and health care providers; and resources specific to behavioral health. Stakeholders may wish to access the following related TCs: Climate Change and Healthcare System Considerations, Disasters and Health Care Disparity and Populations with Access and Functional Needs. Each resource in this TC is placed into one or more of the following categories (click on the category name to be taken directly to that set of resources).

Login to favorite or comment on the article The authors examined how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted sexual minority adults in the U.S. as compared with heterosexual adults. They analyzed data from a national sample of U.S. adults reporting on eight measures of wellbeing. The results show that wellbeing declined across sexual identity subgroups during the pandemic, but that bisexual men and women were most negatively affected.

Login to favorite or comment on the article The authors review results from a community survey to determine how the pandemic affected various aspects of the LGBTQ+ community (e.g., health, social, and occupational areas). They found that overall, the pandemic contributed to decreased quality of life among the community, particularly gender minority people.

A list of legal protections is provided, and strategies for helping prevent this type of violence are found at the bottom of the page. Login to favorite or comment on the article The authors examined how identity affected members of the LGBTQ+ population’s response to the Pulse nightclub shooting. Results showed that “identity centrality” (i.e., the level of importance an individual places on their own concept of self) was associated with identifying with the victims, which led to greater perceived threat and negative affect. The authors conclude that hate crimes can increase distress in individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ and can lead to an increased sense of devaluation. Login to favorite or comment on the article The authors reviewed literature to better understand perceived safety among LGBTQ+ individuals after the Pulse nightclub shooting, including differences based on race/ethnicity, gender identity, and sexual orientation. The results show that individuals from more marginalized identities within the LGBTQ+ community had more safety concerns than those with relatively more privileged identities. Safety concerns could worsen stress, which in turn can lead to poor health outcomes. The authors emphasize the importance of health care providers being trained to work with LGBTQ+ people, providing appropriate care, and giving counselling referrals to improve the sense of safety in this population.

> HHS has taken many steps to strengthen the health resources available to LGBTQ+ Americans. The following are some of those steps and how they have impacted the LGBTQ+ community. Cultural Competency Agencies across HHS are working with health care providers, grantees, employees and others to improve cultural competency with respect to LGBTQ+ populations. HHS encourages its employees to participate in LGBTQI+ cultural competency trainings. The sessions increase awareness and educate employees on sexual orientation and gender identity, and update employees about current sexual orientation and gender identity anti-discrimination requirements. - The National LGBTQIA+ Health Education Center offers a range of educational programs on various topics designed to meet the different learning styles, needs, and time constraints of their audiences. Their programs follow the principles of adult learning and recognize that adults are self-directed, goal-oriented learners who need to see the relevance of the educational material as well as being able to apply it to their everyday practice. A number of the educational programs offer Continuing Medical Education (CME) and Continuing Education Units (CEU). - The Nurses Health Education About LGBTQ Elders (HEALE) curriculum for nurses focuses on teaching cultural competency in the care of LGBTQI+ older adults. The curriculum was developed by Howard Brown Health Center of Chicago entitled “Health Education about Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Elders” was presented to health care providers and published in the Journal of Nursing Management. The HEAL Curriculum is funded through a HRSA grant. The curriculum is availae the curriculum.ble to a variety of healthcare and educational settings for nursing staff and students, as well as any other disciplines who would like to us - National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care (National CLAS Standards) The Office of Minority Health (OMH), in collaboration with federal and non-federal partners, published LGBTQI+-inclusive enhanced National CLAS Standards. The National CLAS Standards are a blueprint for health and human services organizations to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services and promote a more inclusive definition of culture encompassing not only race, ethnicity, and language, but also elements such as sexual orientation and gender identity. OMH is working with health care organizations to ensure that awareness, adoption, and implementation of the National CLAS Standards incorporate this more inclusive definition of culture in order to better serve the LGBTQI+ community. Read more about Think Cultural Health. Recommendations on Providing Quality Family Planning Services In collaboration with The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) Division of Reproductive Health, the Office of Population Affairs has developed and released clinical recommendations, “Providing Quality Family Planning Services.” This document includes evidence-based and evidence-informed recommendations for providing family planning, reproductive, and related preventive health services to all individuals. This document addresses the importance of providing respectful reproductive health care to all individuals, and specifically addresses reproductive health care for LGBTQI+ individuals. These recommendations will help health care providers deliver culturally competent and patient-centered family planning and related preventive care specific to LGBTQI+ individuals. Read the 2017 updated recommendations. Support for LGBTQI+ Residents of Long Term Care Facilities The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Community Living (ACL) increases awareness of the issues faced by LGBTQI+ individuals living in long term care (LTC) facilities. The National Resource Center on LGBTQ+ Aging is the country's first and only technical assistance resource center aimed at improving the quality of services and supports offered to older LGBT adults. Publications The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) released the Top Health Issues for LGBT Populations Information & Resource Kit, a publication for health care providers and prevention specialists about health experiences of LGBT populations. SOGI Data Action Plan Demographic data collection on sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) metrics helps HHS achieve its mission and its Healthy People 2030 goals by identifying disparities in health and human services. The HHS SOGI Data Action Plan seeks to improve the health and well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) people. Anti-Bullying Efforts StopBullying.gov includes resources and assistance for LGBTQI+ youth, including examples of community groups that offer support and options to seek counseling. National HIV/AIDS Strategy The National HIV/AIDS Strategy, a rigorous effort to increase access to care and lower the number of new HIV cases in the United States. These funds are helping states and communities in their HIV prevention efforts among high-risk populations. The funds are also helping fill critical gaps in data, knowledge, and understanding of the epidemic. Aging Services HHS funded the Services and Advocacy for GLBT Elders (SAGE) to establish the first national resource center for older LGBTQI+ individuals. This center supports country individuals who are 60 and older across the country. This center provides information, assistance and resources at the state and community levels. Resettlement of LGBTQI+ Refugees HHS is committed to supporting the safe resettlement of LGBTQI+ refugees who have faced persecution and discrimination in their home countries. Tobacco Control CDC’s Tips from Former Smokers national tobacco education campaign included specific messaging and outreach to the LGBTQI+ community. *Note: This list includes non-federal resources in order to provide a wider scope of information.

Re: Withdrawal of Exception from Non-Discrimination Requirements of 45 CFR 75.300(c) [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.hhs.gov/conscience/religious-freedom/state-letter-to-michigan-withdrawing-exception-from-non-discrimination-requirements/index.html)

> November 18, 2021 Elizabeth Hertel Director Michigan Department of Health and Human Services 333 South Grand Avenue P.O. Box 30195 Lansing, MI 48909-7695 Re: Withdrawal of Exception from Non-Discrimination Requirements of 45 CFR 75.300(c) Dear Director Hertel: On November 3, 2020, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) sent you a letter informing you of its conclusion that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”) prohibited the Department of Health and Human Services (“the Department”) from applying 45 C.F.R. § 75.300(c) (“the 2016 Rule”) against Michigan with respect to the St. Vincent Catholic Charities (“St. Vincent”) and “other similarly situated entities.” The letter was in response to a complaint filed by St. Vincent in Buck v. Gordon, 1:19-cv-00286 (W.D. Mich. Apr. 15, 2019). The 2016 Rule included a requirement that no person will be subjected to discrimination in HHS federal awards. On November 19, 2019, HHS published a notification that it would exercise discretion to not enforce the 2016 Rule, including the non-discrimination provisions in § 75.300(c), due to concerns regarding whether the 2016 Rule complied with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. See Notification of Nonenforcement of Health and Human Services Grants Regulation, 84 Fed. Reg. 63,809 (Nov. 19, 2019) (“The provisions will not be enforced pending a repromulgation that complies with the Act.”). Thus, the non-discrimination provisions in the 2016 Rule that the waiver issued to Michigan sought to address are not currently being enforced. Accordingly, the religious exception granted to Michigan from the 2016 Rule is no longer warranted and, thus, is hereby rescinded. The November 3, 2020 exception was overbroad and did not properly apply the substantial burden requirement under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb, et seq. HHS appreciates the historic participation of faith-based organizations in the foster care and adoption assistance programs. Nothing in this letter limits the ability of faith-based organizations to participate in HHS-funded social service programs on the same basis as other organizations.1 However, the complaint filed by St. Vincent did not provide evidence supporting a blanket exception from section 75.300(c)’s non-discrimination requirements for the benefit of all faith-based subrecipients in Michigan. And the government maintains a strong interest in tailoring the relief provided to mitigate the potential harm of limiting the diversity of available foster homes for children in the foster care population,2 many of whom identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ+). Background Title IV-E of the Social Security Act (Act), codified at 42 U.S.C. § 670 et seq., and implemented under the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 45 CFR parts 1355, 1356, and 1357, provides funding for state foster care program costs contingent on an approved state plan meeting the requirements of title IV-E and regulations. Eligible title IV-E costs include recruitment and training of foster care providers. The broad title IV-E program goals and mission are to strengthen families so that children can depend on their parents to provide them with a safe and loving home. If that is not possible, the program goals are to find a new permanent home for the child. Foster care is considered a temporary living arrangement to ensure the child’s safety and well-being until the child can be safely reunified with their parents, or, when that is not possible, while finding a permanent placement for the child through adoption, legal guardianship, or placement with a relative. Nationally, there are approximately 420,000 children in foster care, each of whom must be placed in the care of a licensed and trained foster family, making the recruitment of licensed and trained foster family homes a persistent need.3 On April 15, 2019, St. Vincent filed suit against the State of Michigan and the Department. St. Vincent alleging, among other things, that the application of 45 C.F.R. § 75.300(c) to Michigan’s title IV-E program substantially burdened its religious exercise in violation of RFRA. Section 75.300(c) (2019) states: (c) It is a public policy requirement of HHS that no person otherwise eligible will be excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination in the administration of HHS programs and services based on non-merit factors such as age, disability, sex, race, color, national origin, religion, gender identity, or sexual orientation. Recipients must comply with this public policy requirement in the administration of programs supported by HHS awards. On September 26, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan granted St. Vincent a preliminary injunction and enjoined the Department from enforcing Section 75.300(c) against Michigan in relation to the actions of St. Vincent. Buck v. Gordon, 429 F. Supp. 3d 447, 465 (W.D. Mich. 2019). On November 19, 2019, HHS published a notice of nonenforcement of the regulation at 45 CFR 75.300(c), on the basis that the final rule promulgating the regulation did not comply with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Even though the issue was mooted by the notice of non-enforcement, on November 3, 2020, OCR wrote to Michigan informing the State of its conclusion that RFRA mandated a waiver of Section 75.300(c) with respect to enforcement against St. Vincent and any “similarly situated entities.” On January 12, 2021, HHS published a final rule (“2021 Rule”) amending 45 CFR 75.300(c) and (d) by removing the requirement prohibiting discrimination based on a variety of factors, including explicit, blanket prohibitions on discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as the specific language that HHS grant recipients implement the United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges decisions in the administration of HHS awards by treating as valid the marriages of same-sex couples. The 2021 Rule requires grant recipients to adhere to non-discrimination requirements in applicable federal statutes and to follow Supreme Court decisions in the administration of HHS grants programs. The 2021 Rule is currently stayed. Application of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act The Department takes seriously its obligation to comply with RFRA, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb, et seq. Where RFRA requires modifying program requirements, the Department will do so. After further consultation within the Department, however, OCR has now concluded that the justification offered in the exemption letter to Michigan misapplied the applicable RFRA standards. The government maintains important civil rights interests in a proper application of RFRA, and therefore clarifies the proper application as set out below. RFRA requires the federal government to justify actions that substantially burden religious exercise by identifying a compelling interest and showing that its actions are the least restrictive means of achieving that interest. The exception provided with respect to the religious organizations participating in Michigan’s IV-E program was overbroad and failed to apply the substantial burden requirement under RFRA. First, it granted a broader exception than required, providing relief to more parties than was justified. RFRA requires evaluating the burden an individual or organization faces in determining whether to grant a religious exception, and to create class-wide regulatory exceptions that apply throughout a state, as the exception to Michigan provides (even when not requested by the other child placing agencies), runs contrary to that analysis. Second, the Department maintains a strong interest in accounting for the harms such a broad exemption could have on third parties. See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 720 (2005) (In addressing religious accommodation requests, “courts must take adequate account of the burdens a requested accommodation may impose on nonbeneficiaries.”). In this case, the exception was granted in response to the burden on one specific religious organization yet applied to “other similarly situated entities.” Moreover, St. Vincent’s complaint did not provide any evidence that other organizations using similar selection criteria considered complying with antidiscrimination protections a substantial burden on their beliefs. Nor did the it proffer evidence regarding the effect the waiver would have on third parties under a class-wide exemption. See Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, 472 U.S. 703, 710-11 (1985) (striking down a Connecticut statute “which provides Sabbath observers with an absolute and unqualified right not to work on their Sabbath” because it failed to consider “special circumstances” or “whether the employer has made reasonable accommodation proposals,” which “contravenes a fundamental principle of the Religion Clauses” by going “beyond having an incidental or remote effect of advancing religion”). Because the complaint did not provide information regarding the other unidentified religious organizations that were granted an exemption, the burden on those other organization’s religious exercise was not established. Any exception should be tailored to reduce the burden on a religious organization while accounting for harms to other parties. In the case of St. Vincent and other faith-based organizations participating in the State’s foster care program, the exception could have been limited to the particular application of the religious nondiscrimination provision to which the Archdiocese objected. Cf. Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 439 (2006) (“[C]ourts should strike sensible balances, pursuant to a compelling interest test that requires the Government to address the particular practice at issue.”). Instead, the exception letter granted St. Vincent an exemption from section 75.300 (c) in whole. In our view, accommodations could have been explored that could have the potential for addressing both the specific religious burden identified by the St. Vincent, while also minimizing the harms passed onto third parties. Third, the IV-E program is unique, as numerous studies have confirmed that LGBTQ+ children are over-represented in the domestic foster care population, and the important role the states necessarily play in providing a broad array of foster care services to serve the domestic population under the title IV-E program.4 We believe that the prior exception might affect such children, as well as impact Michigan’s ability to achieve the goals of the program by providing children with stable temporary or permanent homes, especially given that the exception applied State-wide. As for potential foster parents, the government has a strong interest in a diverse population of foster parents where possible, especially given the over-representation of LGBTQ+ children in the domestic foster care population.5 Such children could suffer psychological harm from placement in homes that do not accept them or require participation in the religious practices with beliefs contrary to the child’s beliefs. Moreover, research has shown that same-sex couples are much more likely to raise a foster child.6 Finally, the letter suggests that applying the non-discrimination provisions of section 75.300(c) would reduce the available pool of foster or adoptive parents in the State. However, the complaint proffered no evidence that other religious child placing agencies would similarly object to working with LGBTQ+ foster parent applicants, nor did it show how eliminating discriminatory eligibility criteria would not also result in a potential increase in the pool of available foster parents, as additional populations feel welcomed by the State and by individual child placing agencies. For these reasons, as well as the 2019 Notice of Nonenforcement of the 2016 Rule, OCR hereby withdraws the November 3, 2020 exception letter sent to Michigan, with respect to St. Vincent and any other subgrantee in the Michigan foster care program using religious criteria to select among prospective foster care parents.

Re: Withdrawal of Exception from Non-Discrimination Requirements of 45 CFR 75.300(c) & (d) [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.hhs.gov/conscience/religious-freedom/state-letter-to-texas-withdrawing-exception-from-non-discrimination-requirements/index.html)

> November 18, 2021 The Honorable Ken Paxton Attorney General of Texas P.O. Box 12548 Austin, TX 78711-2548 Re: Withdrawal of Exception from Non-Discrimination Requirements of 45 CFR 75.300(c) & (d) Dear General Paxton: On March 5, 2020, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) sent you a letter informing you of its conclusion that Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”) prohibited the Department of Health and Human Services (“the Department”) from applying 45 C.F.R. § 75.300(c) and (d) (“the 2016 Rule”) against Texas with respect to the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston and “other similarly situated entities.” The 2016 Rule included a requirement that no person will be subjected to discrimination in HHS federal awards. On November 19, 2019, HHS published a notification that it would exercise discretion to not enforce the 2016 Rule, including the non-discrimination provisions in § 75.300(c) and (d), due to concerns regarding whether the 2016 Rule complied with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. See Notification of Nonenforcement of Health and Human Services Grants Regulation, 84 Fed. Reg. 63,809 (Nov. 19, 2019) (“The provisions will not be enforced pending a repromulgation that complies with the Act.”). Thus, the non-discrimination provisions in the 2016 Rule that the waiver issued to Texas sought to address are not currently being enforced. Accordingly, the religious exception Texas sought from the 2016 Rule is no longer warranted and, thus, is hereby rescinded. The March 5, 2020 exception was overbroad and did not properly apply the substantial burden requirement under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb, et seq. HHS appreciates the historic participation of faith-based organizations in the foster care and adoption assistance programs.1 Nothing in this letter limits the ability of faith-based organizations to participate in HHS-funded social service programs on the same basis as other organizations. However, the State did not provide evidence supporting a blanket exception from section 75.300(c) & (d)’s non-discrimination requirements for the benefit of all faith-based subrecipients in Texas. And the government maintains a strong interest in tailoring the relief provided to mitigate the potential harm of limiting the diversity of available foster homes for children in the foster care population,2 many of whom identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ+). Background Title IV-E of the Social Security Act (Act), codified at 42 U.S.C. § 670 et seq., and implemented under the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 45 CFR parts 1355, 1356, and 1357, provides funding for state foster care program costs contingent on an approved state plan meeting the requirements of title IV-E and regulations. Eligible title IV-E costs include recruitment and training of foster care providers. The broad title IV-E program goals and mission are to strengthen families so that children can depend on their parents to provide them with a safe and loving home. If that is not possible, the program goals are to find a new permanent home for the child. Foster care is considered a temporary living arrangement to ensure the child’s safety and well-being until the child can be safely reunified with their parents, or, when that is not possible, while finding a permanent placement for the child through adoption, legal guardianship, or placement with a relative. Nationally, there are approximately 420,000 children in foster care, each of whom must be placed in the care of a licensed and trained foster family, making the recruitment of licensed and trained foster family homes a persistent need.3 Beginning in 2018, Texas wrote to HHS objecting to the provisions at section 75.300 (c) & (d) and requesting an exception from their application for faith-based providers in the title IV-E program. In its request, Texas did not identify a grant subrecipient that had requested an exemption to the requirements of 45 CFR 75.300(c) and (d). In addition, Texas indicated that some of the State’s faith-based providers require potential foster care or adoptive parents to share a religious faith or agree to the provider’s statement of faith. Section 75.300(c) & (d) (2018) state: (c) It is a public policy requirement of HHS that no person otherwise eligible will be excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination in the administration of HHS programs and services based on non-merit factors such as age, disability, sex, race, color, national origin, religion, gender identity, or sexual orientation. Recipients must comply with this public policy requirement in the administration of programs supported by HHS awards. (d) In accordance with the Supreme Court decisions in United States v. Windsor and in Obergefell v. Hodges, all recipients must treat as valid the marriages of same-sex couples. This does not apply to registered domestic partnerships, civil unions or similar formal relationships recognized under state law as something other than a marriage. On November 19, 2019, HHS published a notice of nonenforcement of the regulation at 45 CFR 75.300(c) and (d), on the basis that the final rule promulgating the regulation did not comply with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. On March 5, 2020, OCR approved the State’s request for an exception under RFRA, and with respect to “the Archdiocese or other similarly situated entities” participating in the State’s foster care program funded under title IV-E of the Social Security Act. On January 12, 2021, HHS published a final rule (“2021 Rule”) amending 45 CFR 75.300(c) and (d) by removing the requirement prohibiting discrimination based on a variety of factors, including explicit, blanket prohibitions on discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as the specific language that HHS grant recipients implement the United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges decisions in the administration of HHS awards by treating as valid the marriages of same-sex couples. The 2021 Rule requires grant recipients to adhere to non-discrimination requirements in applicable federal statutes and to follow Supreme Court decisions in the administration of HHS grants programs. The 2021 Rule is currently stayed. Application of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act The Department takes seriously its obligation to comply with RFRA, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb, et seq.

> Telehealth for LGBTQ+ Patients Telehealth appointments are a safe, convenient way for LGBTQ+ patients to access healthcare. Telehealth can also be a necessary lifeline for some patients who do not have LGBTQ+-affirming healthcare available nearby. Understanding the medical, emotional and social issues unique to LGBTQ+ patients will help providers give quality healthcare in a virtual setting. Best practices for LGBTQ+ telehealth care It is important to make sure your practice is inclusive, both in person and through telehealth. Inclusivity builds comfort and trust, which helps your patient get the best care possible. Make sure your intake and online forms are inclusive. Check to make sure your online or email intake forms or health assessments are updated to be inclusive for sex assigned at birth, gender identity, and sexual orientation. This allows you to collect accurate information you will need as part of your telehealth care and it also lets your LGBTQ+ patients know that you prioritize their health and wellbeing. Review and modify your forms to move away from cis-gendered, heteronormative language. Suggested changes include: “Caregiver” or “parent” instead of “mother” or “father” - “Spouse” instead of “husband” or “wife” - Also allow space for your patients to write in their own answers if the multiple choice options do not apply to them. Examples of inclusive gender identity include: Female - Male - Non-binary - Transgender - Transmasculine - Transfeminine - Genderqueer - Something else (please specify) - Examples of sex assigned at birth could include: Male - Female - Intersex - Something else (please specify) - Examples of sexual orientation include: Straight - Gay/Lesbian - Bisexual - Pansexual - Something else (please specify) - Encourage your colleagues and staff to take LGBTQ+ health education training as part of your telehealth workflow Educating yourself and your staff on LGBTQ+ health care will ensure you are providing the highest quality telehealth care to communities that are often marginalized in traditional health care settings. This especially includes people of color, transgender youth, and people living with HIV/AIDS. There are also large communities of people that fit into several of those categories, which can lead to further marginalization. Specialized training could include information about LBGTQ+ youth, behavioral and mental health, HIV/AIDS treatment and counseling, and transgender health care.

Common pronouns include: She/Her - He/Him - They/Them - Ze/Hir - Some patients may prefer you not use any pronouns at all and stick to their name instead. Taking a moment to review this information before logging on to your telehealth visit will help your patient with comfort and trust, and lead to more open communication. Quick facts: Proper LGBTQ+ terminology Gay: A term used by men, women, and some non-binary people who are attracted to people of the same gender Lesbian: A term used by women and non-binary people who are attracted to other women Bisexual: People who are attracted to two or more genders Non-binary: People who do not identify as male or female, or who identify as both male and female, or somewhere in between Transgender: A person who identifies and expresses themselves as a different gender than what they were assigned at birth. This is not to be confused with sexual orientation. Transgender people may be straight, gay, bisexual or another orientation Cisgender: A person whose gender identity aligns with their sex assigned at birth Read more: Health Equity Guiding Principles for Inclusive Communication — from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Telehealth workflow and LGBTQ+ healthcare There are several ways you can make your telehealth workflow more inclusive to the LGBTQ+ community. These tips will improve the health care of your LGBTQ+ patients: At the start of the telehealth appointment, ensure your patient has privacy and feels safe to speak openly. - Assure your patient that whatever they tell you is confidential, just as it would be if they were in person. - Ask or confirm their pronouns and preferred name. - If you are using telehealth to treat LGBTQ+ patients who are located outside of your own locale, offer to help them find LGBTQ+-friendly physicians and medical facilities if they need to be seen in person. - Treating LGBTQ+ patients through telehealth Telehealth is a great way to deliver necessary, even life-saving, health care to LGBTQ+ patients who live in rural areas or other locations without access to inclusive, non-discriminatory providers, facilities, or treatments. There are several ways to offer LGBTQ+-specific telehealth care: Prescriptions This could include depression and anxiety medication or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Providers can also prescribe gender-affirming hormones for for patients whose gender does not align with their sex assigned at birth, such as transgender and gender non-binary people. Counseling and therapy LGBTQ+ Americans, especially LGBTQ+ youth, have markedly higher rates of suicide than their heterosexual, cisgender counterparts. But there aren’t always LGBTQ+-focused providers in less populated areas. Inclusive behavioral telehealth care can change lives and save lives. HIV/AIDs management and treatment There are fewer numbers of HIV specialists in rural areas. Telehealth can offer patients a variety of HIV/AIDs prevention, treatment and management options: Prescriptions for PrEP and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) - Lab orders for testing - HIV case management - Prevention counseling - HIV/AIDs counseling and therapy - Read more: Telehealth for HIV Prevention and Care Services — from the CDC

> Telesalud para los pacientes LGBTQ+ Las teleconsultas son una forma segura y conveniente de acceder a la atención médica para los pacientes LGBTQ+. La telesalud también puede ser el apoyo necesario para algunos pacientes LGBTQ+ que no disponen en su entorno de atención médica que los acepte. La página Comprensión de los problemas médicos, emocionales y sociales singulares de los pacientes LGBTQ+ ayudará a los profesionales de la salud a prestar una atención médica de calidad en el entorno virtual. Mejores prácticas para la atención médica mediante telesalud de los pacientes LGBTQ+ Es importante asegurarse de que su consulta sea incluyente, tanto en modo presencial como mediante telesalud. La inclusión genera bienestar y confianza, lo cual ayuda a que el paciente reciba la mejor atención posible. Asegúrese de que los formularios en línea y de admisión sean incluyentes Verifique que los formularios de admisión o las evaluaciones médicas en línea o para mandar por correo electrónico estén actualizados para que incluyan tanto el sexo asignado al nacer como la identidad de género y la orientación sexual. Esto le permitirá recopilar información precisa que necesitará para el ejercicio de la atención médica mediante telesalud, y también permite que los pacientes LGBTQ+ sepan que usted prioriza su salud y bienestar. Revise y modifique sus formularios para abandonar el lenguaje cisgénero y heteronormativo. Los cambios sugeridos son, entre otros: - “Cuidador” o “figura parental” en lugar de “madre” o “padre”. - “Cónyuge” en lugar de “esposo” o “esposa” Deje también espacio para que el paciente escriba sus propias respuestas si las opciones a elegir no le son aplicables. Algunos ejemplos de identidad de género inclusiva son: - Mujer - Hombre - Nn binario - Transgénero - Transmasculino - Transfemenino - Genderqueer - Otra (especifique, por favor) Algunos ejemplos del sexo asignado al nacer son: - Hombre - Mujer - Intersexual - Otro (especifique, por favor) Algunos ejemplos de orientación sexual son: - Heterosexual - Gay/lesbiana - Bisexual - Pansexual - Otra (especifique, por favor) Anime a sus compañeros y al personal a recibir formación sobre salud LGBTQ+ como parte de tu flujo de trabajo en telesalud Al educarse usted y educar al personal sobre la atención médica para los pacientes LGBTQ+, se asegurará de que está prestando servicios de telesalud de la más alta calidad a comunidades que a menudo se ven marginadas en los entornos de atención médica tradicionales. Esto incluye de manera particular a las personas no caucásicas, los jóvenes transgénero y las personas que viven con el VIH/SIDA. Además, hay grandes comunidades de personas que entran en varias de estas categorías, lo cual puede resultar en marginalización adicional. La formación especializada puede incluir información sobre los jóvenes LBGTQ+, la salud mental, el tratamiento y las terapias para el VIH/SIDA y la atención médica para los pacientes transgénero. Más información: Centro Nacional de Educación sobre la Salud LGBTQIA+ Planes de estudios de formación sobre pacientes LGBT para profesionales de atención primaria y salud mental — de la Administración de Salud Mental y Abuso de Sustancias (SAMHSA, por sus siglas en inglés) Recomendaciones para recopilar datos sobre pacientes OS/IG — de Fenway Health Utilice los pronombres y el lenguaje adecuados Antes de la teleconsulta, familiarícese con los pronombres que usa el paciente, su identidad de género y su orientación sexual. Algunos pronombres comunes son: - Ella/ellas - Él/ellos - Elle/elles Es posible que algunos pacientes prefieran no usar ningún pronombre y que en su lugar se refiera a ellos por su nombre. Tómese un momento para repasar esta información antes de acceder a la teleconsulta; esto ayudará a que el paciente se sienta más cómodo y con confianza y propiciará a una comunicación más abierta. Puntos clave: Terminología LGBTQ+ adecuada Gay: Término utilizado por hombres, mujeres y algunas personas no binarias que se sienten atraídas por personas de su mismo género. Lesbiana: Término utilizado por mujeres y personas no binarias que se sienten atraídas por otras mujeres. Bisexual: Personas que se sienten atraídas a dos o más géneros. No binario: Personas que no se identifican como hombre ni mujer, o que se identifican como ambos o como algo intermedio. Transgénero: Persona que se identifica y expresa como de género distinto al que le asignaron al nacer. No debe confundirse con la orientación sexual. Las personas transgénero pueden ser heterosexuales, gay, bisexuales o de otra orientación Cisgénero: Persona cuya identidad de género coincide con el sexo asignado al nacer Más información: Principios orientativos de equidad en salud para la comunicación inclusiva — de los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC, por sus siglas en inglés) El flujo de trabajo en la telesalud y la atención médica para los pacientes LGBTQ+ Puede hacer que el flujo de trabajo en la telesalud sea más abierto a la comunidad LGBTQ+ de varias formas. Estos consejos mejorarán la atención médica de los pacientes LGBTQ+: - Al inicio de la teleconsulta, asegúrese de que el paciente esté en un lugar privado y se sienta lo suficientemente seguro como para hablar con franqueza. - Asegúrele al paciente que cualquier cosa que le cuente es confidencial, igual que lo sería si estuviera en una cita presencial. - Pregúntele o confirme qué pronombre y nombre prefiere que utilice al hablarle. - Si usted está utilizando la telesalud para tratar a pacientes LGBTQ+ que están en un lugar distinto a su consultorio, ofrézcase a ayudarles a encontrar médicos e instalaciones médicas para pacientes LGBTQ+ por si necesitan concertar una cita presencial. Tratamiento de los pacientes LGBTQ+ mediante telesalud La telesalud es una estupenda forma de prestar la atención médica necesaria e incluso vital para los pacientes LGBTQ+ que viven en zonas rurales u otras localidades sin acceso a profesionales de la salud, instalaciones o tratamientos no discriminatorios. Hay varias formas de ofrecer atención médica a distancia específica para el colectivo LGBTQ+: Recetas médicas Estas pueden ser para medicamentos para la depresión, la ansiedad o la profilaxis de preexposición (PPrE). Los profesionales de la salud pueden también recetar hormonas de afirmación de género para los pacientes cuyo género no se ajusta al sexo asignado al nacer, como por ejemplo las personas transgénero y las de género no binario. Terapia y psicoterapia de apoyo Los estadounidenses LGBTQ+, y en particular los jóvenes LGBTQ+, tienen tasas de suicidio notablemente superiores a las de sus homólogos heterosexuales y cisgénero. Pero, en las zonas menos pobladas, no siempre hay profesionales de la salud centrados en el colectivo LGBTQ+. La telesalud inclusiva para la salud mental puede cambiar y salvar vidas. Gestión y tratamiento del VIH/SIDA Hay menos especialistas en VIH en las zonas rurales. La telesalud puede ofrecer a los pacientes una variedad de medidas preventivas, tratamientos y opciones de gestión del VIH/SIDA: - Recetas médicas para la PPrE y la profilaxis posexposición (PPE). - Solicitudes de pruebas de laboratorio. - Gestión de los casos de VIH. - Psicoterapia de apoyo para la prevención - Terapia y psicoterapia para el VIH/SIDA Más información: La telesalud para la prevención y los servicios de atención médica del VIH — de los CDC
