In this climate, LGBTQ+ youth are quickly losing access to critical resources, supportive programming, and spaces of belonging. In addition, many caring adults, mentors, child welfare providers, educators, and youth serving organizations are unsure of what, if anything, they can do to affirm LGBTQ+ young people in their care. In part two of our three-part CMWS series on LGBTQ+ youth, Dr. Christian Rummell and Nia Clark, MSW highlight individual actions that each of us can take to counter risks and hostile climates faced by LGBTQ+ young people. In this session, you will learn about the Assets of PRIDE—intentional strategies you can take to build strengths-based relationships for LGBTQ+ young people.
