Tuesday, December 14 at 2:00 pm ET Register for the webinar. The National Paralysis Resource Center (operated by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation) is hosting a webinar that will discuss ideas on how to navigate coming home for the holidays for the LGBTQ+ disability community. Panelists from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and SAGE, an advocacy organization offering services for LGBTQ+ elders, will join this conversation. The panelists will provide a diverse and insightful conversation focusing on topics important to the LGBTQ+ disability community like finances and housing security when coming out, bringing home a partner for the first time, and defusing antagonizing family members. These are just some of the very important and real obstacles that will be addressed during this webinar. To protect everyone's privacy, all attendees will remain anonymous. ACL funds the Paralysis Resource Center to provide comprehensive information for people living with spinal cord injury, paralysis, and mobility-related disabilities and their support networks. Resources include information and referral by phone and email in multiple languages, including Spanish; a peer and family support mentoring program; a military and veterans program; multicultural outreach services; quality of life grants; and a national website.
