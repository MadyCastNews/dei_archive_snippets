A Proclamation on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Pride Month, 2021 [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/01/a-proclamation-on-lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender-and-queer-pride-month-2021/?utm_campaign=mos-enews-june2022&utm_content=html&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery)

> A Proclamation on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Pride Month, 2021 The uprising at the Stonewall Inn in June, 1969, sparked a liberation movement — a call to action that continues to inspire us to live up to our Nation’s promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all. Pride is a time to recall the trials the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ+) community has endured and to rejoice in the triumphs of trailblazing individuals who have bravely fought — and continue to fight — for full equality. Pride is both a jubilant communal celebration of visibility and a personal celebration of self-worth and dignity. This Pride Month, we recognize the valuable contributions of LGBTQ+ individuals across America, and we reaffirm our commitment to standing in solidarity with LGBTQ+ Americans in their ongoing struggle against discrimination and injustice. The LGBTQ+ community in America has achieved remarkable progress since Stonewall. Historic Supreme Court rulings in recent years have struck down regressive laws, affirmed the right to marriage equality, and secured workplace protections for LGBTQ+ individuals in every State and Territory. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act broadened the definition of hate crimes to include crimes motivated by sexual orientation or gender identity. Members of the LGBTQ+ community now serve in nearly every level of public office — in city halls and State capitals, Governors’ mansions and the halls of the Congress, and throughout my Administration. Nearly 14 percent of my 1,500 agency appointees identify as LGBTQ+, and I am particularly honored by the service of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, the first openly LGBTQ+ person to serve in the Cabinet, and Assistant Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine, the first openly transgender person to be confirmed by the Senate. For all of our progress, there are many States in which LGBTQ+ individuals still lack protections for fundamental rights and dignity in hospitals, schools, public accommodations, and other spaces. Our Nation continues to witness a tragic spike in violence against transgender women of color. LGBTQ+ individuals — especially youth who defy sex or gender norms — face bullying and harassment in educational settings and are at a disproportionate risk of self-harm and death by suicide. Some States have chosen to actively target transgender youth through discriminatory bills that defy our Nation’s values of inclusivity and freedom for all. Our Nation also continues to face tragic levels of violence against transgender people, especially transgender women of color. And we are still haunted by tragedies such as the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando. Ending violence and discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community demands our continued focus and diligence. As President, I am committed to defending the rights of all LGBTQ+ individuals. My Administration is taking historic actions to finally deliver full equality for LGBTQ+ families. On my first day in office, I signed an Executive Order charging Federal agencies to fully enforce all Federal laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation. As a result, the Federal Government has taken steps to prevent discrimination against LGBTQ+ people in employment, health care, housing, lending, and education. I also signed an Executive Order affirming all qualified Americans will be able to serve in the Armed Forces of the United States — including patriotic transgender Americans who can once again proudly and openly serve their Nation in uniform — and a National Security Memorandum that commits to supporting LGBTQ+ Federal employees serving overseas. My Administration is also working to promote and protect LGBTQ+ human rights abroad. LGBTQ+ rights are human rights, which is why my Administration has reaffirmed America’s commitment to supporting those on the front lines of the equality and democracy movements around the world, often at great risk. We see you, we support you, and we are inspired by your courage to accept nothing less than full equality. While I am proud of the progress my Administration has made in advancing protections for the LGBTQ+ community, I will not rest until full equality for LGBTQ+ Americans is finally achieved and codified into law. That is why I continue to call on the Congress to pass the Equality Act, which will ensure civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ people and families across our country. And that is why we must recognize emerging challenges, like the fact that many LGBTQ+ seniors, who faced discrimination and oppression throughout their lives, are isolated and need support and elder care. During LGBTQ+ Pride Month, we recognize the resilience and determination of the many individuals who are fighting to live freely and authentically. In doing so, they are opening hearts and minds, and laying the foundation for a more just and equitable America. This Pride Month, we affirm our obligation to uphold the dignity of all people, and dedicate ourselves to protecting the most vulnerable among us. NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2021 as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Pride Month. I call upon the people of the United States to recognize the achievements of the LGBTQ+ community, to celebrate the great diversity of the American people, and to wave their flags of pride high. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fifth. JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

Executive Order on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/25/executive-order-on-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce/)

> Executive Order on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 1104, 3301, and 3302 of title 5, United States Code, and in order to strengthen the Federal workforce by promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Policy. On my first day in office, I signed Executive Order 13985 (Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government), which established that affirmatively advancing equity, civil rights, racial justice, and equal opportunity is the responsibility of the whole of our Government. To further advance equity within the Federal Government, this order establishes that it is the policy of my Administration to cultivate a workforce that draws from the full diversity of the Nation. As the Nation’s largest employer, the Federal Government must be a model for diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, where all employees are treated with dignity and respect. Accordingly, the Federal Government must strengthen its ability to recruit, hire, develop, promote, and retain our Nation’s talent and remove barriers to equal opportunity. It must also provide resources and opportunities to strengthen and advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility across the Federal Government. The Federal Government should have a workforce that reflects the diversity of the American people. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that diverse, equitable, inclusive, and accessible workplaces yield higher-performing organizations. Federal merit system principles include that the Federal Government’s recruitment policies should “endeavor to achieve a work force from all segments of society” and that “[a]ll employees and applicants for employment should receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management” (5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(1), (2)). As set forth in Executive Order 13583 of August 18, 2011 (Establishing a Coordinated Government-Wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce), the Presidential Memorandum of October 5, 2016 (Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in the National Security Workforce), Executive Order 13988 of January 20, 2021 (Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation), the National Security Memorandum of February 4, 2021 (Revitalizing America’s Foreign Policy and National Security Workforce, Institutions, and Partnerships), and Executive Order 14020 of March 8, 2021 (Establishment of the White House Gender Policy Council), the Federal Government is at its best when drawing upon all parts of society, our greatest accomplishments are achieved when diverse perspectives are brought to bear to overcome our greatest challenges, and all persons should receive equal treatment under the law. This order reaffirms support for, and builds upon, the procedures established by Executive Orders 13583, 13988, and 14020, the Presidential Memorandum on Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in the National Security Workforce, and the National Security Memorandum on Revitalizing America’s Foreign Policy and National Security Workforce, Institutions, and Partnerships. This order establishes that diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility are priorities for my Administration and benefit the entire Federal Government and the Nation, and establishes additional procedures to advance these priorities across the Federal workforce. Sec. 2. Definitions. For purposes of this order, in the context of the Federal workforce: (a) The term “underserved communities” refers to populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, who have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life. In the context of the Federal workforce, this term includes individuals who belong to communities of color, such as Black and African American, Hispanic and Latino, Native American, Alaska Native and Indigenous, Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, Middle Eastern, and North African persons. It also includes individuals who belong to communities that face discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity (including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, gender non-conforming, and non-binary (LGBTQ+) persons); persons who face discrimination based on pregnancy or pregnancy-related conditions; parents; and caregivers. It also includes individuals who belong to communities that face discrimination based on their religion or disability; first-generation professionals or first-generation college students; individuals with limited English proficiency; immigrants; individuals who belong to communities that may face employment barriers based on older age or former incarceration; persons who live in rural areas; veterans and military spouses; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty, discrimination, or inequality. Individuals may belong to more than one underserved community and face intersecting barriers. (b) The term “diversity” means the practice of including the many communities, identities, races, ethnicities, backgrounds, abilities, cultures, and beliefs of the American people, including underserved communities. (c) The term “equity” means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment. (d) The term “inclusion” means the recognition, appreciation, and use of the talents and skills of employees of all backgrounds. (e) The term “accessibility” means the design, construction, development, and maintenance of facilities, information and communication technology, programs, and services so that all people, including people with disabilities, can fully and independently use them. Accessibility includes the provision of accommodations and modifications to ensure equal access to employment and participation in activities for people with disabilities, the reduction or elimination of physical and attitudinal barriers to equitable opportunities, a commitment to ensuring that people with disabilities can independently access every outward-facing and internal activity or electronic space, and the pursuit of best practices such as universal design. (f) The term “agency” means any authority of the United States that is an “agency” under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1), other than one considered to be an independent regulatory agency, as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(5). Sec. 3. Government-Wide Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility Initiative and Strategic Plan. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) — in coordination with the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy (APDP), the Director of the National Economic Council, and the Co-Chairs of the Gender Policy Council — shall: (a) reestablish a coordinated Government-wide initiative to promote diversity and inclusion in the Federal workforce, expand its scope to specifically include equity and accessibility, and coordinate its implementation with the provisions of Executive Order 13985 and the National Security Memorandum on Revitalizing America’s Foreign Policy and National Security Workforce, Institutions, and Partnerships; (b) develop and issue a Government-wide Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility Strategic Plan (Government-wide DEIA Plan) within 150 days of the date of this order that updates the Government-wide plan required by section 2(b)(i) of Executive Order 13583. The Government-wide DEIA Plan shall be updated as appropriate and at a minimum every 4 years. The Government-wide DEIA Plan shall: (i) define standards of success for diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility efforts based on leading policies and practices in the public and private sectors; (ii) consistent with merit system principles, identify strategies to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, and eliminate, where applicable, barriers to equity, in Federal workforce functions, including: recruitment; hiring; background investigation; promotion; retention; performance evaluations and awards; professional development programs; mentoring programs or sponsorship initiatives; internship, fellowship, and apprenticeship programs; employee resource group and affinity group programs; temporary employee details and assignments; pay and compensation policies; benefits, including health benefits, retirement benefits, and employee services and work‑life programs; disciplinary or adverse actions; reasonable accommodations for employees and applicants with disabilities; workplace policies to prevent gender-based violence (including domestic violence, stalking, and sexual violence); reasonable accommodations for employees who are members of religious minorities; and training, learning, and onboarding programs; (iii) include a comprehensive framework to address workplace harassment, including sexual harassment, which clearly defines the term “harassment”; outlines policies and practices to prevent, report, respond to, and investigate harassment; promotes mechanisms for employees to report misconduct; encourages bystander intervention; and addresses training, education, and monitoring to create a culture that does not tolerate harassment or other forms of discrimination or retaliation; and (iv) promote a data-driven approach to increase transparency and accountability, which would build upon, as appropriate, the EEOC’s Management Directive 715 reporting process; (c) establish an updated system for agencies to report regularly on progress in implementing Agency DEIA Strategic Plans (as described in section 4(b) of this order) and in meeting the objectives of this order. New reporting requirements should be aligned with ongoing reporting established by Executive Order 13985 and the National Security Memorandum on Revitalizing America’s Foreign Policy and National Security Workforce, Institutions, and Partnerships. Agency reports on actions taken to meet the objectives of this order shall include measurement of improvements, analysis of the effectiveness of agency programs, and descriptions of lessons learned. The Director of OPM and the Deputy Director for Management of OMB shall support agencies in developing workforce policies and practices designed to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility throughout agencies by, for example, providing updated guidance and technical assistance to ensure that agencies consistently improve, evaluate, and learn from their workforce practices; (d) pursue opportunities to consolidate implementation efforts and reporting requirements related to advancing diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility established through related or overlapping statutory mandates, Presidential directives, and regulatory requirements; and (e) support, coordinate, and encourage agency efforts to conduct research, evaluation, and other evidence-building activities to identify leading practices, and other promising practices, for broadening participation and opportunities for advancement in Federal employment, and to assess and promote the benefits of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility for Federal performance and operations and barriers to achieving these goals. Agencies should use the capabilities of their evaluation officers and chief statistical officers and requirements under the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018, Public Law 115-435, to advance this goal. Sec. 4. Responsibilities of Executive Departments and Agencies. The head of each agency shall make advancing diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility a priority component of the agency’s management agenda and agency strategic planning. The head of each agency shall implement the Government-wide DEIA Plan prepared pursuant to section 3 of this order and such other related guidance as issued from time to time by the Director of OPM or the Deputy Director for Management of OMB. In addition, the head of each agency shall: (a) within 100 days of the date of this order, submit to the APDP, the Director of OPM, and the Deputy Director for Management of OMB a preliminary assessment of the current state of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the agency’s human resources practices and workforce composition. In conducting such assessment, the head of each agency should: (i) assess whether agency recruitment, hiring, promotion, retention, professional development, performance evaluations, pay and compensation policies, reasonable accommodations access, and training policies and practices are equitable; (ii) take an evidence-based and data-driven approach to determine whether and to what extent agency practices result in inequitable employment outcomes, and whether agency actions may help to overcome systemic societal and organizational barriers; (iii) assess the status and effects of existing diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives or programs, and review the amount of institutional resources available to support human resources activities that advance the objectives outlined in section 1 of this order; and (iv) identify areas where evidence is lacking and propose opportunities to build evidence to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility and address those gaps identified; (b) within 120 days of the issuance of the Government-wide DEIA Plan, and annually thereafter, develop and submit to the APDP, the Director of OPM, and the Deputy Director for Management of OMB an Agency Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility Strategic Plan (Agency DEIA Strategic Plan), as described by section 3(b) of Executive Order 13583 and as modified by this order. Agency DEIA Strategic Plans should identify actions to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the workforce and remove any potential barriers to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the workforce identified in the assessments described in subsection (a) of this section. Agency DEIA Strategic Plans should also include quarterly goals and actions to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives in the agency workforce and in the agency’s workplace culture; (c) on an annual basis, report to the President on the status of the agency’s efforts to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility within the agency, and the agency’s success in implementing the Agency DEIA Strategic Plan. Consistent with guidance issued as part of the Government-wide DEIA Plan, the agency head shall also make available to the general public information on efforts to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the agency’s workforce; (d) oversee, and provide resources and staffing to support, the implementation of the Agency DEIA Strategic Plan; (e) enhance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility within the agency, in collaboration with the agency’s senior officials and consistent with applicable law and merit system principles; (f) seek opportunities to establish a position of chief diversity officer or diversity and inclusion officer (as distinct from an equal employment opportunity officer), with sufficient seniority to coordinate efforts to promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility within the agency; (g) strongly consider for employment, to the extent permitted by applicable law, qualified applicants of any background who have advanced diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the workplace; and (h) in coordination with OMB, seek opportunities to ensure alignment across various organizational performance planning requirements and efforts by integrating the Agency DEIA Strategic Plan and diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility goals into broader agency strategic planning efforts described in 5 U.S.C. 306 and the agency performance planning described in 31 U.S.C. 1115. Sec. 5. Data Collection. (a) The head of each agency shall take a data-driven approach to advancing policies that promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility within the agency’s workforce, while protecting the privacy of employees and safeguarding all personally identifiable information and protected health information. (b) Using Federal standards governing the collection, use, and analysis of demographic data (such as OMB Directive No. 15 (Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity) and OMB Memorandum M-14-06 (Guidance for Providing and Using Administrative Data for Statistical Purposes)), the head of each agency shall measure demographic representation and trends related to diversity in the agency’s overall workforce composition, senior workforce composition, employment applications, hiring decisions, promotions, pay and compensation, professional development programs, and attrition rates. (c) The Director of OPM, the Chair of the EEOC, and the Deputy Director for Management of OMB shall review existing guidance, regulations, policies, and practices (for purposes of this section, “guidance”) that govern agency collection of demographic data about Federal employees, and consider issuing, modifying, or revoking such guidance in order to expand the collection of such voluntarily self-reported data and more effectively measure the representation of underserved communities in the Federal workforce. In revisiting or issuing any such guidance, the Director of OPM, the Chair of the EEOC, and the Deputy Director for Management of OMB shall take steps to promote the protection of privacy and to safeguard personally identifiable information; facilitate intersectional analysis; and reduce duplicative reporting requirements. In considering whether to revisit or issue such guidance, the Director of OPM, the Chair of the EEOC, and the Deputy Director for Management of OMB shall consult with the Chief Statistician of the United States, the Chair of the Chief Data Officers Council, and the Co-Chairs of the Interagency Working Group on Equitable Data established in section 9 of Executive Order 13985. (d) The head of each agency shall implement any such revised guidance issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section to expand the collection of voluntarily self-reported demographic data. The head of each agency shall also take steps to ensure that data collection and analysis practices allow for the capture or presence of multiple attributes and identities to ensure an intersectional analysis. (e) The head of each agency shall collect and analyze voluntarily self-reported demographic data regarding the membership of advisory committees, commissions, and boards in a manner consistent with applicable law, including privacy and confidentiality protections, and with statistical standards where applicable. For agencies that have external advisory committees, commissions, or boards to which agencies appoint members, agency heads shall pursue opportunities to increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility on such committees, commissions, and boards. Sec. 6. Promoting Paid Internships. (a) The Director of OPM and the Deputy Director for Management of OMB shall issue guidance to agencies and the Executive Office of the President with respect to internships and similar programs within the Federal Government, including guidance on how to: (i) increase the availability of paid internships, fellowships, and apprenticeships, and reduce the practice of hiring interns, fellows, and apprentices who are unpaid; (ii) ensure that internships, fellowships, and apprenticeships serve as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, the competitive hiring process; (iii) ensure that internships, fellowships, and apprenticeships serve to develop individuals’ talent, knowledge, and skills for careers in government service; (iv) improve outreach to and recruitment of individuals from underserved communities for internship, fellowship, and apprenticeship programs; and (v) ensure all interns, fellows, and apprentices with disabilities, including applicants and candidates, have a process for requesting and obtaining reasonable accommodations to support their work in the Federal Government, without regard to whether such individuals are covered by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Public Law 93-112. (b) The head of each agency shall, as part of the annual reporting process described in section 4(c) of this order, measure and report on the agency’s progress with respect to the matters described in subsection (a) of this section. Sec. 7. Partnerships and Recruitment. (a) The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), the Director of OPM, and the Deputy Director for Management of OMB, in consultation with the Chair of the EEOC, shall coordinate a Government-wide initiative to strengthen partnerships (Partnerships Initiative) to facilitate recruitment for Federal employment opportunities of individuals who are members of underserved communities. To carry out the Partnerships Initiative, the Director of OSTP, the Director of OPM, and the Deputy Director for Management of OMB shall take steps to increase diversity in the Federal employment pipeline by supporting and guiding agencies in building or strengthening partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities, including Historically Black Graduate Institutions; Hispanic-Serving Institutions; Tribal Colleges and Universities; Native American-serving, nontribal institutions; Asian American and Pacific Islander-serving institutions; Tribally controlled colleges and universities; Alaska Native-serving and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions; Predominantly Black Institutions; women’s colleges and universities; State vocational rehabilitation agencies that serve individuals with disabilities; disability services offices at institutions of higher education; organizations dedicated to serving veterans; public and non-profit private universities serving a high percentage of economically disadvantaged students or first-generation college or graduate students; community colleges and technical schools; and community-based organizations that are dedicated to serving and working with underserved communities, including return-to-work programs, programs that provide training and support for older adults seeking employment, programs serving formerly incarcerated individuals, centers for independent living, disability rights organizations, and organizations dedicated to serving LGBTQ+ individuals. (b) The head of each agency shall work with the Director of OSTP, the Director of OPM, and the Deputy Director for Management of OMB to make employment, internship, fellowship, and apprenticeship opportunities available through the Partnerships Initiative, and shall take steps to enhance recruitment efforts through the Partnerships Initiative, as part of the agency’s overall recruitment efforts. The head of each agency shall, as part of the reporting processes described in sections 3(c) and 4(c) of this order, measure and report on the agency’s progress on carrying out this subsection. Sec. 8. Professional Development and Advancement. (a) The Director of OPM, in consultation with the Deputy Director for Management of OMB, shall issue detailed guidance to agencies for tracking demographic data relating to participation in leadership and professional development programs and development opportunities offered or sponsored by agencies and the rate of the placement of participating employees into senior positions in agencies, in a manner consistent with privacy and confidentiality protections and statistical limitations. (b) The head of each agency shall implement the guidance issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, and shall use demographic data relating to participation in professional development programs to identify ways to improve outreach and recruitment for professional development programs offered or sponsored by the agency, consistent with merit system principles. The head of each agency shall also address any barriers to access to or participation in such programs faced by members of underserved communities. Sec. 9. Training and Learning. (a) The head of each agency shall take steps to implement or increase the availability and use of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility training programs for employees, managers, and leadership. Such training programs should enable Federal employees, managers, and leaders to have knowledge of systemic and institutional racism and bias against underserved communities, be supported in building skillsets to promote respectful and inclusive workplaces and eliminate workplace harassment, have knowledge of agency accessibility practices, and have increased understanding of implicit and unconscious bias. (b) The Director of OPM and the Chair of the EEOC shall issue guidance and serve as a resource and repository for best practices for agencies to develop or enhance existing diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility training programs. Sec. 10. Advancing Equity for Employees with Disabilities. (a) As established in Executive Order 13548 of July 26, 2010 (Increasing Federal Employment of Individuals with Disabilities), the Federal Government must become a model for the employment of individuals with disabilities. Because a workforce that includes people with disabilities is a stronger and more effective workforce, agencies must provide an equitable, accessible, and inclusive environment for employees with disabilities. In order for Federal employees and applicants with disabilities to be assessed on their merits, accessible information technologies must be provided and, where needed, reasonable accommodations must be available that will allow qualified individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions of their positions and access advancement opportunities. To that end, the relevant agencies shall take the actions set forth in this section.

To that end, the relevant agencies shall take the actions set forth in this section. (b) The head of each agency shall, in coordination with the Director of OPM, ensure that existing employee support services equitably serve LGBTQ+ employees, including, as appropriate, through the provision of supportive services for transgender and gender non-conforming and non-binary employees who wish to legally, medically, or socially transition.

FACT SHEET: President Biden Signs Executive Order Advancing Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Government [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/25/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-advancing-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-government/)

> FACT SHEET: President Biden Signs Executive Order Advancing Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Government Today, President Biden signed an Executive Order to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) in the Federal workforce. This Executive Order reaffirms that the United States is at its strongest when our Nation’s public servants reflect the full diversity of the American people. Even with decades of progress building a Federal workforce that looks like America, the enduring legacies of employment discrimination, systemic racism, and gender inequality are still felt today. Too many underserved communities remain under-represented in the Federal workforce, especially in positions of leadership. This Executive Order establishes an ambitious, whole-of-government initiative that will take a systematic approach to embedding DEIA in Federal hiring and employment practices. When public servants reflect the communities they serve, the government is more effective and successful. That is why the Biden-Harris Administration has appointed an historic number of diverse leaders. Today’s Executive Order will help develop a Federal workforce that looks like America where qualified people from every background and walk of life have an equal opportunity to serve our Nation. The Executive Order: Establishes a government-wide initiative to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in all parts of the Federal workforce. This initiative will be led by the Office of Personnel Management and the Office of Management and Budget, in close partnership with the White House and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The initiative will reinvigorate the whole-of-government approach to DEIA first established in the Obama-Biden Administration. The initiative will advance opportunity for communities that have historically faced employment discrimination and professional barriers, including: people of color; women; first-generation professionals and immigrants; individuals with disabilities; LGBTQ+ individuals; Americans who live in rural areas; older Americans who face age discrimination when seeking employment; parents and caregivers who face employment barriers; people of faith who require religious accommodations at work; individuals who were formerly incarcerated; and veterans and military spouses. Charges all agencies with assessing the current state of diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility within their workforces, and developing strategic plans to eliminate any barriers to success faced by underserved employees. The Order charges all Federal agencies with reviewing within 100 days whether employees who are members of underserved communities face barriers to employment, promotion, or professional development within their workforce. Directs agencies to seek opportunities to establish or elevate Chief Diversity Officers within their organizations. To help ensure the coordination of DEIA initiatives across the Federal government, the Executive Order directs all agencies to look for opportunities to establish senior leaders to promote diversity and inclusion within the workforce. Expands diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility training throughout the Federal workforce. On his first day in office, President Biden rescinded a ban that prevented Federal employees from participating in diversity and sensitivity trainings. Today’s Executive Order builds on that by directing all Federal agencies to expand the availability of DEIA trainings for their workforce, so that Federal employees are supported in building skillsets to promote respectful and inclusive workplaces and have increased understanding of implicit and unconscious bias. These types of trainings equip public servants to best serve the American public, and the many diverse communities that make American strong. Addresses workplace harassment, including sexual harassment. Requires a government-wide, comprehensive plan to address workplace harassment, including sexual harassment. The plan will outline policies and practices to prevent report, respond to, and investigate harassment, and address training, education, and monitoring to create a culture that does not tolerate harassment or other forms of discrimination. Reduces the Federal government’s reliance on unpaid internships, which can create barriers for low-income students and first-generation professionals. The Federal government must be an engine of opportunity for Americans from every walk of life to serve our Nation through public service. But too often, unpaid Federal internships prevent hardworking and talented students and professionals from participating in Federal career advancement opportunities. The Executive Order directs key agencies to take steps to reduce the reliance on unpaid internships, fellowships, and apprenticeships to ensure that more Americans can take advantage of these opportunities. Advances pay equity to ensure that all public servants are fairly compensated for their work and their talents. Many workers continue to face racial and gender pay gaps, and pay inequity disproportionately affects women of color. The Order directs the Office of Personnel Management to review Government-wide regulations and guidance that set pay and wage standards for public servants. It also directs the Office of Personnel Management to consider taking steps to prohibit agencies from seeking or relying on an applicant’s salary history during the hiring process and compensation decisions, an important component of advancing pay equity. Advances equity in the workplace for individuals with disabilities. The Federal government is stronger and more successful when individuals with disabilities have equal opportunities to lead at every level. In spite of decades of progress in removing barriers to employment for employees with disabilities, people with disabilities remain under-represented throughout the Federal government, and particularly in positions of leadership. The Executive Order directs the government to become a model employer for individuals with disabilities. It charges key agencies, including the Department of Labor and the U.S. Access Board, to coordinate across the Federal government to ensure that all Federal workplaces and technologies are fully accessible; improve the process for requesting reasonable accommodations; and ensure that all Federal employees understand their rights to request reasonable accommodations. The Executive Order also directs a review of Schedule A Hiring Authority for individuals with disabilities to assess opportunities to enhance employment opportunities and financial security for employees with disabilities. And the Executive Order directs the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Labor to take steps to expand the use of the Workforce Recruitment Program for college students and recent graduates with disabilities. Advances equity in the workplace for LGBTQ+ public servants. For too long, LGBTQ+ employees have faced discrimination and harassment in the workplace. To advance opportunity for LGBTQ+ employees in the Federal workforce, the Executive Order directs agencies to ensure that the Federal health benefits system equitably serves LGBTQ+ employees and their dependents by expanding access to comprehensive gender-affirming health care. Agencies are also directed to take steps to ensure that federal benefits like sick leave and life insurance equitably serve LGBTQ+ individuals and all families with diverse family structures. The Order charges all agencies to ensure that the usage of gender markers and pronouns in the Federal employment process respects transgender, gender non-conforming and non-binary employees, and directs all agencies to take steps to expand access to gender-neutral facilities inside federal workplaces. Finally, the Order charges all agencies with ensuring that their employee support services equitably serve LGBTQ+ employees, including, transgender and gender non-conforming and non-binary employees who wish to legally, medically, or socially transition. Builds a more diverse pipeline into public service through new recruitment partnerships. Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities, Minority Serving Institutions, and women’s colleges are engines of opportunity and innovation in our Nation. The Executive Order charges agencies with developing new recruitment partnerships to ensure that the Federal government can recruit our Nation’s best talent. Expands Federal employment opportunities for formerly incarcerated individuals. Individuals with prior convictions experience must be supported in accessing employment as they fully re-enter society. The Federal government has an important role to play in supporting formerly incarcerated individuals in fully reintegrating into society and making meaningful contributions to our country. The Executive Order directs the Office of Personnel Management to assess the barriers that formerly incarcerated individuals face when seeking Federal jobs. The Executive Order also tasks the Office of Personnel Management with considering creating new Hiring Authorities to expand job opportunities for individuals with past convictions. Advances equity in professional development. The Executive Order directs agencies to improve the collection of demographic data about which employees are able to access professional development and advancement opportunities to ensure that these programs equitably serve all Federal public servants. Improves the collection of demographic data about the Federal workforce. The Executive Order charges key agencies with reviewing and improving guidance on the collection of demographic data about Federal employees. With improved data on the Federal government’s workforce composition, agencies will be better able to take an evidence-informed approach to reducing inequitable barriers in hiring, promotion, professional development, and retention practices. ###

FACT SHEET: The Biden-Harris Administration Champions LGBTQ+ Equality and Marks Pride Month [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/01/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-champions-lgbtq-equality-and-marks-pride-month/)

> FACT SHEET: The Biden-Harris Administration Champions LGBTQ+ Equality and Marks Pride Month Today, President Biden issued a proclamation affirming June 2021 as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ+) Pride Month, marking a time a time of hope, progress, and promise for LGBTQ+ Americans across the country. After four years of relentless attacks on LGBTQ+ rights, the Biden-Harris Administration has taken historic actions to accelerate the march toward full LGBTQ+ equality. From protecting the civil rights of every LGBTQ+ American, enabling all qualified Americans – including transgender Americans – to serve their country in uniform, ensuring that LGBTQ+ Americans are leaders at every level of the federal government, to protecting and defending the human rights of LGBTQ+ persons around the world, the Biden-Harris Administration is a consistent and reliable partner in the fight for equality at home and abroad. Too many LGBTQ+ Americans across our nation continue facing discrimination and hate, especially LGBTQ+ people of color and transgender Americans, and some states are attempting to roll back the clock on equality with discriminatory bills that target LGBTQ+ people and families. The Biden-Harris Administration reaffirms that no one should face discrimination or harassment because of who they are or whom they love. As President Biden said during his first joint address to Congress, the President has the back of LGBTQ+ people across the country and will continue fighting for full equality for every American – including through continuing to urge the U.S. Senate to pass the Equality Act and provide overdue civil rights protections to LGBTQ+ people and families across the country. This Pride Month, the Biden-Harris Administration celebrates the historic progress made towards LGBTQ+ equality since President Biden took office, including: Signing One of the Most Comprehensive Executive Orders in History on LGBTQ+ Rights on His First Day in Office. Within hours of taking the oath of office, President Biden signed an Executive Order Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation. The Executive Order established that it is the official policy of the Biden-Harris Administration to prevent and combat discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals, and to fully enforce civil rights laws to prevent discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation. The President directed all federal agencies to implement fully all federal laws that prevent discrimination on the basis of sex, to include sexual orientation and gender identity. This Executive Order is one of the most consequential policies for LGBTQ+ Americans ever signed by a U.S. President. As a result of that Order, agencies have already taken key steps to advance LGBTQ+ equality. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced it will interpret and enforce Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act and Title IX to prevent discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. - To address the pervasive discrimination LGBTQ+ families continue to face in housing, the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced it will interpret the Fair Housing Act to prevent discrimination in housing and rental assistance against LGBTQ+ people. HUD will require state and local jurisdictions who receive funding through its Fair Housing Assistance Program to apply the same protections. - In response to the continuing discrimination many LGBTQ+ individuals face in credit and lending services, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that it will enforce against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in credit and lending services. - The Department of Justice issued new guidance to agencies clarifying that Title IX sex discrimination protection includes protection on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. - To ensure that LGBTQ+ Veterans are treated with dignity and respect, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has undertaken an agency-wide review of its policies and practices to remove barriers that transgender veterans and their families face. - It is DOJ’s position that the Constitution requires prisons to provide reasonable protection to all prisoners, including transgender prisoners, from serious harm, including sexual abuse. - Launching a Whole-Of-Government Initiative to Advance Equity and Justice for Underserved Communities, Including LGBTQ+ Communities. On his first day in office, President Biden signed a historic Executive Order establishing a cross-government initiative to advance equity and justice for communities who have been left behind, underserved, or discriminated against by federal policies, laws, and programs, including LGBTQ+ communities. The President directed all agencies to take steps to advance equity by taking comprehensive action to root out bias from federal programs and policies, engage with underserved communities, and ensure that federal resources equitably reach all Americans, including LGBTQ+ Americans. Enabling All Qualified Americans to Serve Their Country in Uniform. In his first week in office, President Biden signed an Executive Order reversing the ban on openly transgender servicemembers serving in the Armed Forces, enabling all qualified Americans to serve their country in uniform. President Biden believes that gender identity should not be a bar to military service, America’s strength is found in its diversity, and an inclusive military strengthens our national security As a result of his Executive Order, the Department of Defense issued new policies which prohibit discrimination against transgender servicemembers, provide a path for transgender servicemembers to access gender-affirming medical care, and require that all transgender servicemembers are treated with dignity and respect. Patriotic transgender servicemembers are once again able to openly and proudly serve our Nation in uniform. Advancing an Equitable Recovery from COVID-19 for LGBTQ+ Americans across the Country. President Biden knows that LGBTQ+ individuals and families have been disproportionately burdened by the COVID-19 health crisis and economic crisis. Even before COVID-19, LGBTQ+ Americans were more likely to be uninsured and unemployed, and were more likely to experience poverty, have a pre-existing condition, and experience food insecurity. These barriers have posed unique risks to the physical and financial health of LGBTQ+ people during this crisis. The President’s American Rescue Plan makes significant investments in an equitable recovery, and is helping LGBTQ+ families across the country recover from COVID-19 by: Addressing food insecurity among LGBTQ+ communities by increasing the value of nutrition assistance by 15 percent. - Advancing health equity for LGBTQ+ Americans, who remain more likely to be uninsured, by improving access to and affordability of health coverage through the Marketplace, and expanding mental health resources. - Supporting LGBTQ+ Americans, who are more likely to experience unemployment and continue to face discrimination in the job market, by extending unemployment insurance benefits critical to helping many families, including LGBTQ+ families, stay afloat. - Addressing the disproportionate rates of housing insecurity and homelessness faced by LGBTQ+ Americans, especially transgender youth, by expanding emergency rental assistance programs. - Signing and Leading Implementation of a Presidential Memorandum on Advancing the Human Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex Persons Around the World. President Biden directed all agencies engaged abroad to ensure that United States diplomacy and foreign assistance promote and protect the human rights of LGBTQ+ persons. His Memorandum establishes that it “shall be the policy of the United States to pursue an end to violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or sex characteristics, and to lead by the power of our example in the cause of advancing the human rights of LGBTQ+ persons around the world.” As previously highlighted by the White House, Departments and Agencies are already making progress in areas towards the goals outlined in the Presidential Memorandum, including: strengthen existing efforts to combat the criminalization by foreign governments of LGBTQ+ people and expand efforts to combat discrimination, homophobia, transphobia, and intolerance on the basis of LGBTQ+ status or conduct; protect vulnerable LGBTQ+ refugees and asylum seekers; help ensure the Federal Government has a swift and meaningful response to serious incidents that threaten the human rights of LGBTQ+ persons abroad; and build coalitions with like-minded nations to counter discrimination against LGBTQ+ people around the world. Establishing the White House Gender Policy Council to Advance Gender Equity and Equality. President Biden signed an Executive Order establishing the White House Gender Policy Council to advance gender equity and equality across the whole of the government, including by addressing barriers faced by LGBTQ+ people, in particular transgender women and girls, across our country. Ensuring Educational Environments are Free from Sex Discrimination and Protecting LGBTQ+ Students from Sexual Harassment. President Biden signed an Executive Order recommitting the Federal Government to guarantee educational environments free from sex discrimination, including sexual harassment and including discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, and directing the Department of Education to review and as necessary consider revising agency actions that are inconsistent with that policy. The Executive Order charged the Department of Education with reviewing the significant rates at which students who identify as LGBTQ+ are subject to sexual harassment, including sexual violence. Signing a National Security Memorandum Supporting Federal Employees Serving Overseas, including LGBTQ+ Employees. President Biden signed a National Security Memorandum on Revitalizing America’s Foreign Policy and National Security Workforce, Institutions, and Partnerships. The Memorandum directs agencies to take steps to retain, develop, promote, and support LGBTQ+ and other national security employees, and employees with LGBTQ+ family members. Ensuring Transgender Americans Can Access Emergency Shelter That Dignifies and Respects Their Identity. The Department of Housing and Urban Development restored protections for transgender individuals seeking emergency shelter and homeless services. HUD reaffirmed its commitment that no person be denied access to housing or other critical services because of their gender identity. Creating a Historically Diverse Cabinet and Administration. The Biden-Harris Administration includes barrier-breaking LGBTQ+ leaders, including Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, who is the first openly gay Cabinet Secretary confirmed by the U.S. Senate, and Assistant Secretary for Health Dr. Rachel Levine, who is the first openly transgender person ever confirmed by the U.S. Senate. President Biden has assembled the most diverse Administration in our Nation’s history, and is proud to serve alongside the 14 percent of all appointees who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer. Issuing the First White House Proclamation for Transgender Day of Visibility. On March 31, 2021 President Biden became the first U.S. President to issue a proclamation commemorating Transgender Day of Visibility. The proclamation honored and celebrated the achievements and resiliency of transgender individuals and communities, and recognized the generations of struggle, activism, and courage that have brought our country closer to full equality for transgender and gender non-binary people in the United States and around the world. Ensuring Pride Flags Fly on U.S. Embassies Around the World. The State Department announced it will allow U.S. diplomatic outposts to fly the Pride flag on the same flagpole as the U.S. flag at their embassy or consulate, demonstrating that the United States will lead on LGBTQI+ human rights around the world. ###

FACT SHEET: The Equality Act Will Provide Long Overdue Civil Rights Protections for Millions of Americans [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/25/fact-sheet-the-equality-act-will-provide-long-overdue-civil-rights-protections-for-millions-of-americans/)

> FACT SHEET: The Equality Act Will Provide Long Overdue Civil Rights Protections for Millions of Americans Freedom and equality are fundamental American values. But today, millions of Americans lack basic non-discrimination protections just because of who they are or whom they love. President Biden believes that every American must be able to live freely, openly, and safely. Thatâs why he continues to call on the Senate to swiftly pass the Equality Act, legislation which will provide long overdue federal civil rights protections to LGBTQ+ Americans and their families, while strengthening some key civil rights laws for people of color, women, people with disabilities, and people of faith. Despite the progress our Nation has made towards full equality, LGBTQ+ Americans still lack full non-discrimination protections in 29 states. In the absence of a Federal non-discrimination law, more than half of all U.S. states lack laws on the book prohibiting discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals and families. The lack of federal non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ+ people means that millions of Americans can be denied housing, education, credit and more just because of who they are or whom they love. In states across the country, LGBTQ+ Americans can get married on Sunday, and denied a rental lease on Monday. The Equality Act will provide long overdue civil rights protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity â ensuring LGBTQ+ Americans are finally afforded equal protection under law. The Equality Act amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to provide explicit non-discrimination protections on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity. The bill builds on the Supreme Courtâs ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County by making explicit that non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ+ people in employment settings apply to other areas of life. The Equality Act will help protect LGBTQ+ Americans who continue to report facing discrimination. Studies show that majority of LGBTQ+ Americans say they have personally experienced discrimination because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Transgender Americans, especially transgender women of color, continue to face rampant discrimination in housing, employment, and in public. These types of discrimination cause LGBTQ+ Americans to face higher rates of poverty, violence, and unemployment than other Americans. Discrimination isnât just wrong. It also is detrimental to the physical health and safety of LGBTQ+ Americans, especially transgender women of color. LGBTQ+ Americans still face discrimination when seeking medical care or visiting a doctor. In surveys, nearly 29% of transgender people in the United States say theyâve been refused medical care because of their identity, which can lead to avoidance of medical care. That is why the Department of Health and Human Services announced that it is taking steps to address and prevent discrimination against LGBTQ+ Americans in healthcare settings, but Federal legislation is needed to codify these protections. Discrimination also leads to violence. Transgender women of color face epidemic levels of violence. Too often, this violence stems from institutional discrimination in healthcare settings, housing, and employment. Anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination also contributes to mental health inequities faced by LGBTQ+ youth. 75 percent of LGBTQ+ youth say theyâve experienced discrimination because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Discrimination and bullying are detrimental to the mental health of any young person, and more than half of all transgender and non-binary youth say they have seriously considered commitment suicide in the past year. To address bullying and discrimination at school, the Department of Education has announced that it is taking steps to expand protections for LGBTQ+ students in our Nationâs schools, but Federal legislation is needed to codify these protections. The Equality Act will also expand public accommodations protections for people of color, women, and people of faith. The Equality Act would also strengthen civil rights protections for other protected groups, including people of color, women, people with disabilities, and people of faith by expanding where non-discrimination protections apply to public accommodations. ###

> Readout of White House Roundtable with LGBTQ+ and Gun Violence Prevention Leaders on the Fifth Anniversary of the Pulse Nightclub Mass Shooting On Friday, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice and White House Public Engagement Director and Senior Advisor Cedric Richmond hosted a virtual roundtable with LGBTQ+ leaders and gun violence survivors and advocates to recognize the fifth anniversary of the mass shooting at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Together, they observed a moment of silence to honor the 49 individuals who lost their lives in the Pulse tragedy and the traumatic impact that the mass shooting had on LGBTQ+ and Latino communities across the country. During the meeting, three courageous LGBTQ+ gun violence survivors discussed the impact that gun violence has had on their lives. Participants shared their perspectives on the ongoing public health crisis of gun violence in America and the burden that this crisis has on LGBTQ+ communities across our nation.

> Remarks by President Biden Commemorating LGBTQ+ Pride Month East Room 2:39 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT: Well, my name is Joe Biden. I’m Jill Biden’s husband. (Laughter.) Ashton, thank you. You seemed awfully comfortable up here. (Laughter and applause.) You were awfully comfortable up here. I don’t know. I — I’m not sure I’ll be around, but, you know — (laughter) — if you’re here, just don’t pretend you don’t know me. Okay? (Laughter.) Your story, your leadership, and your mom is an inspiration. (Applause.) Your mom. If my mother were here, she’d look at you and say, “Honey, God love you, dear.” God love you — what you do, what you did, what you continue to do. I want to thank Secretary — well, first of all, I want to say to Chasten: Belated happy birthday, Chasten. (Applause.) If you could hear us inside, we were singing happy birthday to him. We got a bunch of cupcakes, but not enough for everybody. (Laughter.) But — and, Mr. Secretary, thank you. You are — you’re the best, man. Look, our presence here this afternoon makes a simple, strong statement: Pride is back at the White House. (Applause.) For this community and for our nation and for the world, Pride Month represents so much. It stands for courage — the courage of all those in previous generations and today who proudly live their truth. It stands for justice: both the steps we’ve taken and the steps we need to take. And above all, Pride Month stands for love — you know, being able to love yourself, love whomever you love, and love this country enough to make it more fair and more free and more just. You know, during the campaign, Tim Gill and Scott Miller — and Tim — one of them is here today, I don’t want to embarrass him; he always gets mad when I do that — (laughter) — brought me and Jill to visit the Stonewall Inn. I wanted to go, and they wanted — they offered to take me. We wanted to pay tribute to that hallowed ground that represents the the fight to ensure that all people are treated with dignity and respect. Just a few minutes ago, surrounded by the survivors of family members who were — we’ve lost, I signed a bill consecrating another piece of hallowed ground: the Pulse nightclub. And I want to thank all of the members of the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate for standing up and making sure that will never be forgotten. Never be forgotten. The site of the deadliest attack affecting the LBT- — LGBTQ+ community in American history. It’s now a national memorial. This month, on the way to the office, I walk through — from my — from the Residence to the Oval Office every morning — I walk through a hallway lit with rainbow colors of Pride, which you’ll have a chance to see in just a few minutes. You’ll see a candle carried during the AIDS vigil in the early ’90s by a pair — and a pair of sandals belonging to Matthew Shepard. They’re reminders of how much this community has suffered and lost. But they’re also reminders of this community’s incredible resiliency, the incredible contributions, the incred- — including, we just saw, the National Football League and the National Women’s Soccer League. All of you here — Henry Muñoz and Kyle — good to see you, man — (laughter). I had the — I had the opportunity to officiate at their wedding. (Laughter and applause.) And Representative Malcolm Kenyatta — where are you, Malcolm? You’re around here some — (applause) — good to see you, man. And Dr. Matt Miller — they stole the show at the Democratic Convention. (Laughter.) And my friend, Sarah McBride — where is Sarah? (Applause.) Sarah? Sarah worked closely with my son, Beau, when he was Attorney General of the State of Delaware; and is now serving Delaware, as well, as one of the first openly transgender state legislators in history. Senator. (Applause.) You just heard from our history-making Secretary of Transportation. And we have today the first openly transgender person ever confirmed to the U.S. Senate — you just met her — Dr. Levine. (Applause.) Representation matters. Recognition matters. But there’s something else that matters: Results. Results. I am proud to lead the most pro-LGBTQ equality administration in U.S. history. And even on the very — my very first day in office, the first executive order I signed was to change the whole of the federal government to commit to work aggressively to root out discrimination against LBT- — LGBTQ+ people and their families. That was the first executive order. I ordered our agencies — every agency — to rapidly implement the Supreme Court’s ruling in Bostock, which affirmed that civil rights protections on the basis of sex apply to sexual orientation and gender identity. And as a result of that executive order, the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs [Development] announced that it would be — take steps to protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination in housing, and ensured critical protections for transgender Americans experiencing homelessness. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced it would work to combat discrimination against LGBTQ+ people in credit and lending. The Department of Health and Human Services announced it would protect against discrimination in healthcare services. And just last week, the Department of Education made clear that Title IX protections apply to sexual orientation and gender identity — (applause) — and prohibit discrimination against LGBTQ students in our nation’s schools. And a moment ago, I signed an executive order to advance diversity, equality, and inclusion, and accessibility across the entire federal workforce. The order directs the entire federal government to eliminate barriers so people from every background and walk of life have an equal opportunity to serve our nation, including LGBTQ+ folks and all employees in underserved communities. Look, I also was proud to rescind the discriminatory and un-American ban on openly transgender servicemembers. Today, we’re joined by Lieutenant Colonel Bree Fram. Bree, Colonel — (applause) — thank you. One of the highest-ranking openly transgender servicemembers in the United States Military. Lieutenant Colonel Fram, thank you for your service to our nation. We owe you. Thank you. (Applause.) And everyone who has served — everyone deserves the absolute high quality of healthcare. That’s why I was so pleased that, last week, Secretary McDonough announced the Department of Veterans Affairs is beginning the process to provide more comprehensive gender-affirming care to our nation’s transgen- — for our nation’s transgender veterans. We’re also making equality the centerpiece of our diplomacy around the world. We believe LGBTQ+ rights are human rights. In February, I signed a presidential memorandum establishing that it’s the policy of the United States to pursue an end to violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. This month, Pride flags are flying — as some of my friends in our last admin- — in the Obama-Biden administration who are openly gay — they are flying in more than — over 130 U.S. embassies around the world. (Applause.) A powerful — a powerful symbol of our commitment to safety, dignity, and opportunity for all. And today, I’m proud to announce that Jessica Stern, who many of you know as an LGBT special — -Q+ special envoy at the State Department. And yes, we’re also making progress, but I know we still have a long way to go, a lot of work to do. But we must protect the gains we’ve made and fend off the cruel and unconscionable attacks we’re seeing now to ensure that everyone enjoys the full promise of equality and dignity and protection. When I was Vice President, I was proud — although, some — it won’t surprise some people in the administration at the moment — (laughter) — and, by the way, I did tell the President that I would not go out and proselytize, but if I was asked, I would not remain quiet. (Laughter.) The President — I was proud to have called for marriage equality, along with Barack Obama, because, at the time, I said, “Love is love, period.” Six year ago, tomorrow, when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of marriage equality, we’re all reminded of the White House lit up in rainbow colors. Shortly thereafter, I went to New York to celebrate with my friend Evan Wolfson and a team from — at Freedom to Marry. The joy was palpable. But we knew then, as we know now, that our work is unfinished. When a same-sex couple can be married in the morning but denied a lease in the afternoon for being gay, something is still wrong. Over half of our states — in over half of our states, LGBTQ+ Americans still lack explicit state-level civil rights protections to shield them from discrimination. As I said as a presidential candidate and in my first joint address to Congress, it’s time for the United States Senate to pass the Equality Act and put the legislation on my desk. (Applause.) Put it on my desk. Harvey Milk was right when he said, quote, “It takes no compromise to give people their rights.” It takes no compromise to give people their rights. And, by the way, this bill doesn’t just protect LGBTQ+ people. It’s also going to strengthen existing civil rights protections for people of faith, people of color, people with disabilities, women — in public accommodations, like doctors’ offices, parks, and gyms. I want to thank the leaders of the Congressional Equity [Equality] Caucus for their continued work to make it happen. The Equality Act will also help protect against the disturbing proliferation of anti-LGBTQ bills we’re seeing in state legislatures. So far this year, hundreds of anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced in state legislatures. More than a dozen of them have already passed — more than a dozen of them. These are some of the ugliest, most un-American laws I’ve seen, and I’ve been here awhile. Many of them target transgender children, seeking to prevent them from receiving the appropriate medical care; for using the bathroom at high schools while they’re — the one where they’ll be most safe; even preventing them from joining sports teams with their classmates. Let’s be clear: This is nothing more than bullying disguised as legislation. (Applause.) As I’ve said before, many times, transgender kids are some of the bravest people in the world. I mean it sincerely. You just saw it with Ashton, and you’ll see it with several other young people here. It takes courage to be true to your authentic self and to face — in the face of the — these kinds of discrimination you know exist. It takes a toll. We know more than half of transgender youth seriously considered suicide just in the past year. These young people aren’t hurting anyone, but these laws are hurting them. And they’ve got to stop. Our deceased son, Beau — when he was Delaware’s Attorney General — was one of the first AGs in the country to call for legislation to establish legal protections on the basis of gender identity to protect — to protect trans people — trans people. And now, the Department of Justice has filed statements of interest in cases challenging two of these — those bills that got passed — explaining why they’re so unconstitutional. So, we have to work. We have to work to do so much in these areas to support seniors, aging in isolation without support; to confront disproportionate levels of homelessness and poverty and unemployment in the LGBTQ community; to address the — the epidemic level of violence against transgender people, especially transgender women — it’s been mentioned before — women of color — in the coming days, my administration is going to have more to say about that; and to finally eradicate the AIDS epidemic. (Applause.) I’m not sure I’m allowed to talk about this — (laughter) — but our son, Beau, who was a decorated war veteran and attorney general of the United — of the state of Delaware and should be standing here instead of me, came home from war after a year in Iraq and, before that, six months in Kosovo. And what he did — he decided he was going to set up a foundation for LGBTQ youth, but primarily focusing on transgender youth. And he took all the money left from the campaign — he was going to run for governor — and put it in and a lot more. Because in his working with everyone from YMCAs to all the — all the — all the areas where young people can find some solace — his buddy Chris Coons and my buddy Senator Coons knows what he’s done. The point is: A lot of transgender youth — those who commit suicide — based on the studies his foundation has done, do it because their mom doesn’t understand, because mom or dad says, “You can’t be here anymore” — are rejected. So, folks, we got a lot of work to do. A lot of it’s basically public education. Let me close with this: When you go downstairs, you’ll see some of the Smithsonian exhibit. You get a sense of the long, long journey — and how long it’s been, and how far we’ve come — have you come. But how much further we have to go. So, this afternoon, we celebrate. But tomorrow, we go back to work. Progress won’t come easily; it never has. But we’re going to stand strong, stand together. And I promise you, we will succeed. I promise you. I said to folks earlier, you know things are — why — why — I always get asked by the press, “Why are you so optimistic, Biden?” Well, as my neurosurgeon once said, I’m probably a congenital optimist. But beyond that — (laughter) — it’s a simple proposition. Look at the young people: straight and gay, doesn’t matter. They’re the least prejudiced — this generation — the most open, the most giving, and the best educated generation in history. It’s a fact. In all of history. And look where they are. Look how it’s changing. It’s changing in ways that — in my generation, 270 years ago — (laughter) — you’d get beat up for defending somebody. But really and truly, there’s a great reason for hope. And so much talent — so much talent can be unleashed by embracing the LGBT+ community — -Q+ community. So I want to thank you and say: Happy Pride. May God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. (Applause.) 2:58 P.M. EDT

Statement by President Joe Biden on the 5th Anniversary of the Pulse Nightclub Shooting [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/12/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-5th-anniversary-of-the-pulse-nightclub-shooting/)

> Statement by President Joe Biden on the 5th Anniversary of the Pulse Nightclub Shooting Five years ago today in Orlando in the middle of Pride Month, our nation suffered the deadliest attack affecting the LGBTQ+ community in American history, and at the time, the deadliest mass shooting by a single gunman. Within minutes, the Pulse nightclub that had long been a place of acceptance and joy turned into a place of unspeakable pain and loss. Forty-nine people were there celebrating Latin night were murdered, even more injured, and countless others scarred forever ā the victims were family members, partners and friends, veterans and students, young, Black, Asian and Latino ā our fellow Americans. A few days later, I traveled with President Obama to pay respects to them and their families, to thank the brave first responders and the community who found strength and compassion in each other, and to pledge that what happened would not be forgotten. Over the years, I have stayed in touch with families of the victims and with the survivors who have turned their pain into purpose, and who remind us that we must do more than remember victims of gun violence and all of the survivors, family members, and friends left behind; we must act. In the coming days, I will sign a bill designating Pulse Nightclub as a national memorial, enshrining in law what has been true since that terrible day five years ago: Pulse Nightclub is hallowed ground. But there is more we must do to address the public health epidemic of gun violence in all of its forms ā mass shootings and daily acts of gun violence that donāt make national headlines. It is long past time we close the loopholes that allow gun buyers to bypass background checks in this country, and the Senate should start by passing the three House-passed bills which would do exactly that. It is long past time we ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines, establish extreme risk protection orders, also known as āred flagā laws, and eliminate gun manufacturersā immunity from liability. We must also acknowledge gun violenceās particular impact on LGBTQ+ communities across our nation. We must drive out hate and inequities that contribute to the epidemic of violence and murder against transgender women ā especially transgender women of color. We must create a world in which our LGBTQ+ young people are loved, accepted, and feel safe in living their truth. And the Senate must swiftly pass the Equality Act, legislation that will ensure LGBTQ+ Americans finally have equal protection under law. In the memory of all of those lost at the Pulse nightclub five years ago, let us continue the work to be a nation at our best ā one that recognizes and protects the dignity and safety of every American. # # #
