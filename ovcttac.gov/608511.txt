The military has its own way of life â€“ its own social structure, unique hierarchy, and even its own laws. Community-based victim service providers who are not familiar with the military may find it baffling and impenetrable. But when a sexual assault involves both community and military providers, both parties must know how to work together to support the victim more effectively. This interactive, 1.5-day training is designed for community victim advocates, law enforcement officials, sexual assault nurse examiners, mental health counselors, prosecutors, military victim advocates, sexual assault medical forensic examiners, military chaplains, and military criminal investigators. The purpose of this program is to train local community victim advocates on building effective partnerships with local military installations to enhance and extend the system of support for sexual assault victims in the military. Throughout this training, participants build knowledge about military systems, protocols, and culture to improve service provision to sexual assault victims in the military and to develop an appreciation of the perspectives of their future collaborative partners. With the knowledge gained through this training process and their own expertise in sexual assault, local community victim advocates will be able to serve as knowledgeable resources to military installations.
