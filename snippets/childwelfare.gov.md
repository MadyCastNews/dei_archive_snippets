> Creating LGBTQ Affirming Agencies Video and Guide The Creating LGBTQ Affirming Agencies video and guide builds State and territorial capacity to create culturally inclusive environments within child welfare agencies for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) individuals. Creating a culturally inclusive environment means developing a welcoming, culturally sensitive, supportive, and affirming agency for all peopleâregardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. Culturally inclusive child welfare agencies provide children, youth, and families with opportunities to: See themselves mirrored in the agencyâs art and photos - Feel visible instead of invisible - Fill out forms inclusive of sexual orientation and gender identity - Receive respectful treatment from support staff, frontline staff, training staff, and supervisory staff - The Creating LGBTQ Affirming Agencies Video Guide helps public child welfare agencies understand the purpose of and context for the Creating LGBTQ Affirming Agencies video and how the video can be used to support LGBTQ children, youth, and families who are involved in the child welfare system. It also includes additional resources as well as discussion questions that agencies may use to facilitate presentation of the video. This video illustrates two versions of one couple's experience with an agency: The first version shows an agency that does not demonstrate a culturally-inclusive environment, while the second version shows an agency that does.
