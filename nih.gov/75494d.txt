Advancing Evidence-Based Interventions to Improve Access to Mental Health Services for LGBTQ+ Youth Date Location Overview Significant mental health disparities exist for sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth as a result of frequent discrimination and a lack of support from family members and society. To improve mental health outcomes, it is important to understand how LGBTQ+ youth of color and their families negotiate intersecting identities, manage stigma and discrimination, and develop or utilize social support systems. This webinar provided an overview of an NIMH-sponsored study that adapts an evidence-based mental health intervention for LGBTQ+ youth of color and their families. It also showcased potential mechanisms that can be used to adapt the intervention to address mental health disparities faced by SGM youth of color.
