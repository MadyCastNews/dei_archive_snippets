SpeakOUT: Intersections of LGBTQ Identity and Art June 27 @ 7:00 pm - 8:30 pm The LGBTQ Resource Center presents their first community event in their SpeakOUT series, Intersections of LGBTQIA+ Identity and Art. This panel discussion will explore how important art is to individual self-expression and the cultural ethos of a community. Presenters and scholars will examine the role of economic forces in artistsâ€™ ability to create art while maintaining sustainable livelihoods, the unique experiences encountered by LGBTQIA+ artists, and how LGBTQIA+ identity intersects with other identities an artist brings to her/his/their work. Registration is suggested but not required.
