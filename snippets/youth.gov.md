> Youth who receive special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA 2004) and especially young adults of transition age, should be involved in planning for life after high school as early as possible and no later than age 16. Transition services should stem from the individual youth’s needs and strengths, ensuring that planning takes into account his or her interests, preferences, and desires for the future. Behavioral Health “Behavioral health” is an umbrella term that includes issues and services related to mental health, suicide, and substance use/misuse. This section discusses information relevant to these two subject areas as they intersect with LGBTQ+ youth. Mental Health and Suicide As the Institute of Medicine has noted, LGBT youth are typically well adjusted and mentally healthy.1 However, they experience higher rates of mental health challenges and increased health complications arising from these challenges compared to their heterosexual peers.2 Research on transgender youth outcomes as separate from lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth outcomes is more limited, though growing. Some recent nonrandom surveys of self-identified transgender people indicate that up to one-third reported attempting suicide at least once, with higher rates for youth and young adults than for older adults.3 Moreover, suicide is the third leading cause of death among youth ages 15 to 24, and LGBT youth are more likely to attempt suicide than their peers.4 This does not mean, however, that LGBT identity itself is the cause of these challenges. Rather, these higher rates may be due to bias, discrimination, family rejection, and other stressors associated with how they are treated because of their sexual identity or gender identity/expression.5 These challenges, which researchers refer to as “microaggresions,”6 can contribute to anxiety, depression, and other mental health challenges, as well as to suicide and self-harming behavior. Research has found that lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth have much higher levels of suicidal ideation than their heterosexual peers.7 Also, recent population-based studies suggest that the reported rates of suicide attempts for high school students who identify as LGBTQ+ are two to seven times higher than rates among high school students who describe themselves as heterosexual.8 LGBTQ+ youth are also twice as likely to have thoughts about suicide.9 The 2021 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health surveyed nearly 35,000 LGBTQ youth ages 13-24 and found several revealing insights on the state of LGBTQ+ youth mental health in the U.S.: 42 percent of LGBTQ youth seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year, including more than half of transgender and nonbinary youth. - 31 percent of Native/Indigenous youth attempted suicide, 21 percent of Black youth did so, 21 percent of multiracial youth, 18 percent of Latinx youth, 12 percent of Asian/Pacific Islander youth, and 12 percent of white youth. - More than 80 percent of LGBTQ youth stated that COVID-19 made their living situation more stressful. - 70 percent of LGBTQ youth stated that their mental health was "poor" most of the time or always during the COVID-19 pandemic. - Nearly half of LGBTQ youth reported they wanted counseling from a mental health professional, but were unable to receive it in the past year. - There were also findings that support the importance of welcoming and safe environments, resources, and services for LGBTQ+ youth and their mental health: Transgender and nonbinary youth who were able to change their name and/or gender marker on legal documents, such as driver’s licenses and birth certificates, reported lower rates of attempting suicide. - LGBTQ youth who had access to spaces that affirmed their sexual orientation and gender identity reported lower rates of attempting suicide. - Transgender and nonbinary youth who reported having pronouns respected by all the people they lived with attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected by anyone with whom they lived.10 - Strategies to improve mental health and prevent self-harming behavior and suicide include: providing safe and supportive environments, particularly through affirming relationships with family and peers11 - enacting legislation to protect the safety of LGBTQ+ youth - re-evaluating institutional practices that undermine positive youth development - building community awareness and capacity to understand and address stressors that LGBT youth may experience13 - Substance Use LGB youth may be more likely to use substances to cope with bias and stress and may be more likely to experience increased rates of depression and anxiety than their non-LGB peers.13 Challenges such as family rejection of, or anticipated reaction to, one’s LGBT identity are also associated with substance use.14 National prevalence data show that high school students in the U.S. who identify as LGB engage in substance use at significantly higher rates than their heterosexual peers.15 Through national surveys, LGB high school students and young adults recently reported two to three times greater rates of ever using hard drugs (e.g., cocaine, ecstasy, methamphetamine, heroin), compared to their heterosexual peers.16 Transgender youth have a high risk for developing substance dependency issues. Transgender individuals have higher rates of usage for some drugs and may have higher rates of methamphetamine, injectable drugs, and tobacco usage.17 Reducing the rates of bias, discrimination, and victimization that LGBTQ+ youth experience can help reduce substance use. A related strategy includes creating safe spaces for LGBTQ+ youth in drug-free environments, such as community centers. Also, accepting/positive family behaviors toward LGBTQ+ youth during adolescence can protect against not only suicide and depression but also substance use.18 Resources National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 800-273-TALK (8255) The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is a 24-hour, toll-free, confidential suicide prevention hotline available to anyone in suicidal crisis or emotional distress.

In addition, young leaders tend to be more involved in their communities, and have lower dropout rates than their peers. Youth leaders also show considerable benefits for their communities, providing valuable insight into the needs and interests of young people Statistics reflecting the number of youth suffering from mental health, substance abuse, and co-occurring disorders highlight the necessity for schools, families, support staff, and communities to work together to develop targeted, coordinated, and comprehensive transition plans for young people with a history of mental health needs and/or substance abuse. Nearly 30,000 youth aged out of foster care in Fiscal Year 2009, which represents nine percent of the young people involved in the foster care system that year. This transition can be challenging for youth, especially youth who have grown up in the child welfare system. Research has demonstrated that as many as one in five children/youth have a diagnosable mental health disorder. Read about how coordination between public service agencies can improve treatment for these youth. Civic engagement has the potential to empower young adults, increase their self-determination, and give them the skills and self-confidence they need to enter the workforce.

> Youth who receive special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA 2004) and especially young adults of transition age, should be involved in planning for life after high school as early as possible and no later than age 16. Transition services should stem from the individual youth’s needs and strengths, ensuring that planning takes into account his or her interests, preferences, and desires for the future. Child Welfare LGBTQ+ youth enter the child welfare system for reasons like those of other children and youth — that is, their birth families cannot provide a safe, stable, and nurturing home. In some cases, families reject, neglect, or abuse young people when they learn that they identify as LGBTQ+ or are questioning their romantic/sexual orientation or gender identity. LGBTQ+ youth are overrepresented in child welfare systems, even though they are likely to be underreported because they risk harassment and abuse if their LGBTQ+ identity is disclosed. Studies have found that about 30 percent of youth in foster care identify as LGBTQ+ and 5 percent as transgender, in comparison to 11 percent and 1 percent of youth not in foster care.1 Furthermore, LGBTQ+ youth of color are disproportionately overrepresented in the child welfare system and stay longer in child welfare systems, while also having an increased risk of experiencing discrimination and violence compared to their peers.2 Experiences of LGBTQ+ Youth in Child Welfare Systems LGBTQ+ youth may experience challenges under the care of child welfare systems. Unfortunately, a high percentage of LGBTQ+ youth continue to experience verbal harassment or physical violence after they are placed in out-of-home care due to conflicts related to their sexual orientation or gender identity.3 In the Los Angeles study, 13 percent of LGBTQ+ youth reported being treated poorly by the foster care system, compared with 6 percent of non- LGBTQ+ youth.4 Many LGBTQ+ youth experience multiple disrupted placements, compounding the trauma associated with leaving their families of origin and increasing the chances of homelessness.5 For example, 78 percent of LGBT6 youth in one study were removed or ran away from foster placements because of the caregiver’s hostility toward their sexual orientation or gender identity.7 Furthermore, as noted in the homelessness and housing section of this topic, the streets are home to a disproportionate number of youth who are LGBTQ+. Some estimates suggest that the percentage of youth who are homeless and LGBTQ+ could be as high as 40 percent.8 Other research has found that as many as 56 percent of LGBT youth in out-of-home care have spent some time without stable housing because they felt safer on the streets than in group or foster homes.9 One study found that 65 percent of LGBT youth experiencing homelessness had lived in group or foster homes and that 39 percent of these youth had been forced to leave their homes because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.10 Furthermore, LGBT youth in foster care are less likely than other youth to find a permanent home, whether through reunification with their birth or kin families or through adoption.11 The resources at the end of this section can inform the efforts of child welfare systems to improve policies, practices, and outcomes for LGBTQ+ youth and their families. Supporting LGBTQ+ Youth in Child Welfare Systems Professionals who work with youth need to understand the lives and unique challenges of the LGBTQ+ youth they serve and the implications of policies, practices, and organizational climates on their experiences and outcomes. Many resources are available for caregivers and others in the child welfare workforce to develop competencies and to understand what to expect and how to talk about and positively address issues that affect LGBTQ+ youth, including providing safe and supportive environments (with families or in group or foster homes). Like all youth, LGBTQ+ youth need a safe and stable place to live, freedom to express themselves, and structure and guidance to support them in becoming responsible, healthy adults. Given this, the Children’s Bureau of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the Administration for Children & Families has invested funding in the Los Angeles LGBT Center’s RISE (Recognize Intervene Support Empower) Initiative, which serves as an example of an approach for supporting LGBTQ+ youth in child welfare systems. RISE aims to improve permanency for LGBTQ+ children and youth in the foster care system by assessing disproportionality and disparities in Los Angeles (PDF, 82 pages) and reducing heterosexism, anti-gay, and anti-transgender bias. RISE focuses on LGBTQ+ children and youth ages five to 19 with open cases at the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (L.A. County DCFS), including those who are gender non-conforming and gender-questioning. RISE’s partners include the L.A. County DCFS and more than 20 community organizations. The initiative has three components so that LGBTQ youth in Los Angeles (1) find durable family connections, (2) achieve emotional permanency, and (3) obtain legal permanency in homes where they feel safe, nurtured, and loved into adulthood. Supporting Families in Child Welfare Systems Child welfare systems can work with the families of origin of LGBTQ youth to support reunification. This may include, for example, connecting these families and youth to counseling services that help to address challenges the family may be experiencing. Resources for Recruiting and Supporting LGBTQ+ Families A growing number of adoption agencies and professionals are proactively welcoming LGBTQ+ adoptive families. These families represent a pool of highly motivated and qualified prospective foster and adoptive parents and expand the options for permanency for youth. However, in many parts of the country, LGBTQ+ communities remain largely untapped as resources for adoption services. Targeted efforts are necessary to reduce barriers to families who want to adopt youth, including those who are LGBTQ+.

> Youth who receive special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA 2004) and especially young adults of transition age, should be involved in planning for life after high school as early as possible and no later than age 16. Transition services should stem from the individual youth’s needs and strengths, ensuring that planning takes into account his or her interests, preferences, and desires for the future. Families Family acceptance and support are significant factors that promote well-being and protection from risks for all youth, including LGBTQ+ youth.1 The meaning of “family” varies by personal, cultural, and other factors and can include individuals who are not biologically or legally related to a youth (i.e., families of choice).2 Family acceptance, along with strong parent-child attachment, has been found to be critical to LGBTQ+ youth’s ability to “successfully navigate stigma, isolation, and bullying.”3 Family acceptance of LGBTQ+ youth through understanding and appropriately and positively responding to their experiences and needs is a strong protective factor for the youth in successfully transitioning to adulthood. Therefore, it is important for families to express support through: talking openly with youth about their LGBTQ+ identity in an affirming manner - communicating that their young person can have a happy future as an LGBTQ+ adult - welcoming the youth’s LGBTQ+ friends and supporting their involvement in LGBTQ+ youth groups - working to ensure that other family members respect the young person - talking with clergy and help their faith community support LGBTQ+ individuals - responding positively to the youth’s gender expression including hairstyle, dress, and appearance - advocating for youth if they are mistreated because of their identity4 - It is also important for youth-serving agencies and communities to enhance their cultural competence in working with LGBTQ+-headed families, which are increasing in number.5 Youth who are not LGBTQ+ but have an LGBTQ+ caregiver may also experience bias and other negative outcomes because of reactions to their caregiver’s LGBTQ+ identity. Youth-serving organizations and systems can build awareness about and encourage family behaviors that research has shown can affect outcomes for LGBTQ+ youth. Examples of behaviors that should be avoided and discouraged include: blocking access to LGBTQ+ friends, events, and resources - blaming youth when they are discriminated against because of their LGBTQ+ identity - pressuring youth to be more (or less) “masculine” or “feminine” - pressuring youth to keep their LGBTQ+ identity a “secret”6 - Although some families are supportive, accepting, and even celebratory, others may respond and behave in ways that have negative consequences and result in trauma to the youth. In 2021, The Trevor Project surveyed nearly 35,000 LGBTQ youth ages 13-24 across the United States7 and found that only 1 in 3 LGBTQ youth surveyed found their home to be LGBTQ-affirming.8 Research demonstrates a strong link between family rejection of LGBT youth and negative physical and mental health outcomes for them, including being a risk factor for suicide.9 Resources getREAL (Recognize. Engage. Affirm. Love) This initiative promotes the healthy development of all children and youth, with a focus on sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression. getREAL challenges public systems working with children and youth to improve their policies and practices to support the healthy sexual and identity development of all children and youth in child welfare systems. A Practitioner's Resource Guide: Helping Families to Support Their LGBT Children (PDF, 18 pages) This guide offers information and resources to help practitioners throughout health and social service systems implement best practices in engaging and helping families and caregivers to support their LGBT children. Resources for LGBT Youth and Friends/Supporters, and Parents, Guardians and Family Members This webpage provides many resources for LGBT youth and friends, such as a communication tool to empower LGBT youth to become actively engaged in their health, and supportive organizations such as The Trevor Project and It Gets Better. There are also resources for parents, guardians, and family members to learn how to be supportive of LGBT youth, including fact sheets (PDF, 3 pages) and guides (PDF, 18 pages).

Homelessness and Housing [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://youth.gov/youth-topics/lgbtq-youth/homelessness)

> Youth who receive special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA 2004) and especially young adults of transition age, should be involved in planning for life after high school as early as possible and no later than age 16. Transition services should stem from the individual youth’s needs and strengths, ensuring that planning takes into account his or her interests, preferences, and desires for the future. Homelessness and Housing Homelessness is a devastating experience that has a significant negative impact on an individual’s physical and mental health, well-being, functioning, human development, and life trajectory. LGBT youth who run away and experience homelessness are at high risk for certain negative experiences and outcomes.1 LGBTQ+ youth are significantly overrepresented in homeless populations compared with the general population.2 The Voices of Youth Count project from Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago found that LGBTQ young adults are more than twice as likely to experience homelessness than their non-LGBTQ peers. Additionally, youth who are Black or multiracial and LGBTQ reported the highest rates of homelessness (16 percent), and white and LGBTQ youth report a rate of 8 percent.3 LGBTQ+ youth experience homelessness at higher rates than non-LGBTQ+ youth for a range of reasons. A study of more than 350 runaway and homeless providers throughout the United States identified four top causes for homelessness among LGBTQ+ youth: (1) family rejection resulting from sexual orientation or gender identity; (2) physical, emotional, or sexual abuse; (3) aging out of the foster care system; and (4) financial and emotional neglect.4 Another study that interviewed LGBTQ+ youth who experienced homelessness found that the path to homelessness was “described as a gradual escalation of the parent-child conflict over time, or a growing sense of rejection in the home...” This finding shows there may be more opportunity to intervene before an LGBTQ+ youth becomes homeless.5 Experiences of LGBTQ+ Youth Who Experience Homelessness In shelters, while searching for housing, and on the streets, LGBTQ+ youth may endure traumatic experiences, such as harassment, stigmatization, and abuse from peers and shelter staff as a result of their sexual orientation and/or gender expression.6 LGBTQ+ youth may find it difficult to find housing and may be asked to leave shelters after revealing their sexual or gender identity. As a result of harassment and negative experiences in shelters, LGBT youth are more likely to live on the streets than their heterosexual peers and are especially vulnerable to physical and sexual exploitation.7 LGB youth who experience homelessness also experience high rates of conduct disorder, post-traumatic stress, and suicidal behavior.8 Supporting LGBTQ+ Youth Who Experience Homelessness To address these challenges, LGBTQ+ youth who experience homelessness need access to safe, supportive housing. Street outreach, homeless shelters, transitional living programs, and other housing programs and services for youth should be free of bias and harassment and provide access to culturally competent services that affirm their identity and welcome them.9 This requires strategies to improve the cultural competence of staff working in these programs and providing these services, including: analyzing how staff are screened before being hired> - providing professional development to current staff, including enhanced training to identify and respond to trauma experienced by this population10 - engaging LGBTQ+ youth as full partners in strengthening and improving systems and services - locating LGBT-sensitive outreach, services, and housing options in or near predominantly black and multiracial communities equitably11 - developing partnerships with the LGBTQ+ community to connect youth with adult LGBTQ+ role models12 - Runaway and homeless youth services should also follow positive youth development and trauma-informed approaches in providing care and supports. Such an approach requires that system and program policies, practices, structures, and values are grounded in knowledge and understanding of trauma. Care that is not trauma-informed risks inadvertent retraumatization of vulnerable youth.13 A trauma-informed approach focuses on physical, psychological, and emotional safety. Many youth who are homeless have experienced chaotic and violent environments. Youth can more easily heal when they feel safe.14 It is also important for runaway and homeless youth services to: promote positive youth development - provide safe spaces for LGBTQ+ youth - offer services and supports to reconnect youth with their families when it is safe to do so - connect youth to community resources and services that are affirming and safe for LGBTQ+ youth - expand public awareness about LGBT youth issues and decrease stigma associated with LGBT identity15 - Resources Framework to End Youth Homelessness: A Resource Text for Dialogue and Action (PDF, 15 pages) This framework provides clarity on how to address youth homelessness to help reach the federal goal of ending homelessness among children and youth. getREAL (Recognize. Engage. Affirm.

Nearly 30,000 youth aged out of foster care in Fiscal Year 2009, which represents nine percent of the young people involved in the foster care system that year. This transition can be challenging for youth, especially youth who have grown up in the child welfare system. Research has demonstrated that as many as one in five children/youth have a diagnosable mental health disorder. Read about how coordination between public service agencies can improve treatment for these youth.

> June is LGBT Pride Month Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month (LGBT Pride Month) is celebrated annually in June to honor the 1969 Stonewall riots, and works to achieve equal justice and equal opportunity for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) Americans. In June of 1969, patrons and supporters of the Stonewall Inn in New York City staged an uprising to resist the police harassment and persecution to which LGBT Americans were commonly subjected. This uprising marks the beginning of a movement to outlaw discriminatory laws and practices against LGBT Americans. Today, celebrations include pride parades, picnics, parties, workshops, symposia and concerts, and LGBT Pride Month events attract millions of participants around the world. Memorials are held during this month for those members of the community who have been lost to hate crimes or HIV/AIDS. The purpose of the commemorative month is to recognize the impact that LGBTQ individuals have had on history locally, nationally, and internationally. Federal and local policies and practices are increasingly acknowledging and focusing on LGBTQ youth and numerous national advocacy and other organizations are also giving greater attention to LGBTQ youth in their work. Encouraging greater acceptance and support for all youth, including those who are or are perceived to be LGBTQ, will make communities, schools, and other settings safer, better places for all youth. To get involved: The White House is holding an LGBT Pride Month Champions of Change Video Challenge to explore the stories of unsung heroes and local leaders who are leading our march towards a more perfect union. In early June, you will have a chance to weigh in and help identify finalists that will be featured as Champions of Change at an event at the White House! - Take a look at resources from the Administration on Children and Families’ National Clearinghouse on Youth and Families.

Transition services should stem from the individual youth’s needs and strengths, ensuring that planning takes into account his or her interests, preferences, and desires for the future. Juvenile Justice LGBTQ+ youth represent at least 13 to 15 percent of the total detained population in the juvenile justice system.1 LGBTQ+ youth of color are disproportionately overrepresented in the juvenile justice system and are more likely to experience discrimination and violence.2 Some LGBTQ+ youth become involved in the system for violating laws for reasons unrelated to their sexual orientation or gender identity/expression, such as engaging in nonviolent survival acts like shoplifting and prostitution while homeless. Others may become involved through pathways that are associated with their sexual orientation or gender identity/expression, such as: family rejection and subsequent homelessness, either because youth run away or are forced to leave their homes - detention for consensual, age-appropriate, same-sex behavior3 - LGBT youth have the right to the same safe conditions and protection from harassment and violence within juvenile justice facilities as their peers.4 However, policies to prevent discrimination, bias, and harassment of LGBT youth are limited, and staff are often not trained to create a safe environment for LGBT youth.5 As a result, many of these youth experience a juvenile justice system that is biased and abusive. LGBTQ+ youth in juvenile justice settings may experience high levels of verbal, physical, or sexual abuse and humiliation from peers and adults. Rather than address these issues, staff may move LGBT youth to a more restrictive or isolated environment.6 LGBT youth may also be labeled as sex offenders despite no such history.7 It is important for juvenile justice facilities to establish and enforce policies that protect LGBT youth from harassment and discrimination and to ensure that staff are well trained in the unique experiences of LGBT youth to create safe, supportive environments for youth and appropriately address harassment and abuse.8 Policy Approaches to Protecting LGBTQ+ Youth in the Juvenile Justice System The Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) requires correctional agencies to safely screen, classify, and house individuals who are LGBTQ+ or have intersex conditions. PREA mandates the reporting of any sexual behavior among residents and prohibits any sexual behavior by adolescents in residential programs. Even touching is reportable. Facilities are also responsible for providing access to appropriately trained professionals and medically necessary treatment when an individual requests medical care. The Juvenile Drug Court Treatment Guidelines (PDF, 60 pages) were developed by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency and a collaborative team of researchers to translate the best evidence into research-informed practice guidelines. Within this resource there are guidelines specifically targeted to help ensure LGBTQ+ youth who participate in a juvenile drug treatment court (JDTC) receive equitable care, including:9 Guideline 2.5: JDTCs should ensure that eligibility criteria result in equity of access for all genders; racial and ethnic groups; and youth who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex, and gender nonconforming (LGBTQI-GNC) and Two-Spirit. - Guideline 7.1: Court and treatment practices should facilitate equivalent outcomes (e.g., retention, duration of involvement, treatment progress, positive court outcomes) for all program participants, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. - Additionally, Guideline 1.4, which focuses on ensuring all team members have equal access to high-quality regular training and technical assistance, emphasizes the importance of using cultural competence when working with youth and families. The following language from this guideline details how and why focusing on LGBTQ+ youth is important and is a good example of how to frame policies related to improving the welfare of LGBTQ+ youth in all human service systems: Juvenile justice professionals who work with LGBTQI–GNC youth will also benefit from training on concepts such as sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expressions, as well as Prison Rape Elimination Act standards, rules, and regulations pertaining to this population. Such training will allow those who work in the field to assess any inherent biases and enhance their knowledge of discriminatory practices or policies that can interfere with the administration of fair and beneficial treatment to LGBTQI–GNC youth. Further, this training will stress that all youth deserve to be treated with fairness, dignity, and respect regardless of their gender identity or means of expression.10 Resources getREAL (Recognize.

LGBTQI+ On any given night in 2023, there were approximately 34,700 people under 25 who experienced homelessness as an unaccompanied minor.1 Current studies, as well as anecdotal evidence from social service professionals, suggest that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, or intersex (LGBTQI+) youth are significantly overrepresented in homeless populations,2 with a recent study finding that LGBTQI+ young adults experience homelessness at more than twice the rate of their peers.3 In addition to being at greater risk for experiencing homelessness, LGBTQI+ young people represent up to 40 percent of the youth homeless population4 related to factors such as family rejection and abuse, as well as discrimination. According to a survey of homeless service providers serving LGBTQI+ young people, 68 percent of the homeless youth served had a history of family rejection, 65 percent had a history of mental health issues (such as depression or anxiety), and 54 percent had a history of family abuse (physical, emotional, or sexual). LGBTQ youth experience many similar issues leading to homelessness; however, estimates suggest issues are exaggerated for transgender youth.5 At home, in shelters, searching for housing, and on the streets, these youth may endure traumatic experiences, such as harassment, stigmatization, or abuse from family, peers, and shelter staff as a result of their sexual orientation and/or gender nonconformity.6 Youth may have difficulty finding housing and may be asked to leave shelters after revealing their sexual or transgender identity. As a result of harassment and negative experiences in their homes and shelters, LGBTQI+ youth are more likely to live on the streets than their heterosexual peers and are especially vulnerable to physical and sexual exploitation.7 LGBTQI+ youth who experience homelessness also experience higher rates of trauma and adversity, including high rates of conduct disorder, posttraumatic stress, and suicidal behavior, with approximately 60 percent likely to attempt suicide.8 To address these challenges, LGBTQI+ youth who are affected by homelessness or are in out-of-home care need protection from harassment, access to culturally appropriate support, and equal treatment and supportive services.9 It is important for shelters, transitional housing, and permanent housing to promote positive youth development, provide trauma-informed services and safe spaces for LGBTQI+ youth, offer family reconciliation services (when appropriate), and connect youth to community resources and services.10 Responses to youth homelessness are typically crisis oriented. A comprehensive approach can better prevent youth homelessness, such as using prevention services (e.g., providing equitable and culturally appropriate health and mental health services) and diversion strategies (e.g., quickly helping homeless or youth at-risk to “choice driven” crisis housing and tailored services that will lead to permanent housing).11 View the Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity topic to learn more about LGBTQI+ youth.

In addition, young leaders tend to be more involved in their communities, and have lower dropout rates than their peers. Youth leaders also show considerable benefits for their communities, providing valuable insight into the needs and interests of young people Statistics reflecting the number of youth suffering from mental health, substance abuse, and co-occurring disorders highlight the necessity for schools, families, support staff, and communities to work together to develop targeted, coordinated, and comprehensive transition plans for young people with a history of mental health needs and/or substance abuse. Nearly 30,000 youth aged out of foster care in Fiscal Year 2009, which represents nine percent of the young people involved in the foster care system that year. This transition can be challenging for youth, especially youth who have grown up in the child welfare system. Research has demonstrated that as many as one in five children/youth have a diagnosable mental health disorder. Read about how coordination between public service agencies can improve treatment for these youth. Civic engagement has the potential to empower young adults, increase their self-determination, and give them the skills and self-confidence they need to enter the workforce.

> New Brief Highlights the Needs of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning Youth in Child Welfare Settings This is cross-posted in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Children & Families The Family Room blog. See the original post here. By Tyler Hatch, Truman-Albright Fellow, Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation and Catherine Heath, Child and Family Program Specialist, Children’s Bureau A recent brief from the Permanency Innovations Initiative (PDF, 10 pages) highlights how research is helping us to better understand the needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth in child welfare settings. The brief presents findings from qualitative interviews conducted with youth participating in the Recognize, Intervene, Support, and Empower (RISE) project, funded through a grant from the Children’s Bureau to the Los Angeles LGBT Center. The RISE project is designed to address the barriers to permanency experienced by LGBTQ youth in foster care. During interviews, youth indicated they needed support with general needs, help communicating with their families, and improving connections with the larger LGBTQ community. Youth discussed positive outcomes from their time participating with RISE— including the ability to realize, define, or express their LGBTQ identity, increased self-acceptance and self-confidence, and a broader support network. “This new brief brings to life the experiences of LGBTQ youth who are unfortunately growing-up in LA’s foster care system. We hear directly from young people about how important it is to have open and accepting caseworkers and other supportive adults. These words illustrate why we must continue striving to ensure that our nation’s foster care system provides a safe haven for every child, regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity,” said Commissioner Rafael López of the Administration on Children, Youth and Families. A survey conducted as part of the RISE Project (PDF, 82 pages) found that 1 in 5 youth living in foster care in Los Angeles County identify as LGBTQ. The finding is twice the estimated percentage of youth not in foster care who are LGBTQ. Generally, LGBTQ youth in foster care mirror the racial/ethnic demographic of all youth in foster care in Los Angeles County. The majority of LGBTQ are people of color: over 86 percent are Latino, Black, or Asian/ Pacific Islander. LGBTQ youth in foster care are twice as likely to report poor treatment and more likely to live in group homes and to have more foster care placements. More than 18 percent of all respondents reported experiencing discrimination related to their perceived sexual orientation or gender identity/expression, some of whom don’t identify as LGBTQ. The percentage of LGBTQ youth who were hospitalized for an emotional reason (13.5 percent) was nearly triple the percentage of similar hospitalizations for non-LGBTQ youth (4.2 percent). However, the number and proportion of LGBTQ youth in foster care remains unknown in nearly all states and localities.1 To help address this gap, ACF’s Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation (OPRE) conducted a multi-year project that identified the knowledge base and research needs related to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) populations. The project examined how LGBT populations interact with child welfare programs and youth programs, including programs for runaway and homeless youth. Additional research is needed (PDF, 8 pages) to better understand the needs of LGBTQ youth in the child welfare system. The RISE youth surveys (part of a larger evaluation of RISE currently being conducted by OPRE) provide one example of current research to better understand the needs of LGBTQ youth in the child welfare system and to inform program development aimed at meeting those needs. 1 Burwick, Andrew, Scott Baumgartner, and Gary Gates.

> New Reports Highlight the Human Service Needs of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender (LGBT) Populations This is cross-posted in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Children & Families The Family Room blog. By Tyler Hatch, Truman-Albright Fellow, Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation & Catherine Heath, Child and Family Program Specialist, Children’s Bureau One challenge to addressing the human service needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) populations is a lack of relevant research. Two new reports published by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) describe what is known and discuss areas for future research related to the use of human services by LGBT populations. Human Services for Low-Income and At-Risk LGBT Populations: An Assessment of the Knowledge Base and Research Needs This report explores our current understanding of the human service needs of low-income and at-risk LGBT people and their interactions with human services, especially those funded by ACF, and identifies important topics for further research in this area. One of the areas the report addresses is the child welfare system. Key findings include: LGB youth are at increased risk for experiencing maltreatment and abuse compared to non-LGB youth. - Sexual minority youth may experience more instability in foster care placements than do their heterosexual peers, possibly as a result of stigma. - Lesbian and gay parents report perceiving barriers in the process of adoption related to legal restrictions, inadequate professional training for agency staff related to LGBT issues, or bias among adoption agency staff or other professionals. - Recognize, Intervene, Support, and Empower (RISE) Report In 2008, the Children’s Bureau began investing in the Recognize, Intervene, Support, and Empower (RISE) project, a multi-year, multi-million dollar effort to address the barriers to permanency experienced by LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning) youth in foster care. The project is located in Los Angeles County, California and operated by the Los Angeles Gay & Lesbian Center. The RISE work is a multi-pronged approach to serving LGBTQ youth. One critical component was a survey to determine the number of youth in L.A. County’s foster care system who identify as LGBTQ. This report- like others- indicates that LGBTQ youth are over-represented in the foster care system and that they fare worse than their peers. The survey found that approximately 19% or 1 in 5 youth in the L.A. County foster care system identify as LGBTQ. Many of these youth report feeling unsafe in their placements and higher rates of emotional distress. They are also more likely to have more placements and to be living in group homes. The RISE project also developed an intentional model to address both the system-level and individual-level bias against LGBTQ youth in foster care. In addition to the survey, the RISE initiative includes: Outreach and Relationship Building pilots for creating an affirming environment; - Educational materials to train and coach staff on LGBTQ competency, including the ability to talk about sexuality and gender with children and youth; and - Care Coordination Teams using family search and engagement strategies informed by LGBTQ competencies to alleviate issues arising from heterosexism and transphobia. - LGBTQ youth in foster care need additional supports to ensure that they, like all youth, are placed permanently with a loving and supportive family and do not languish in foster care.

> Providing Unbiased Services for LGBTQ Youth Project Collaboration Structure The collaboration is supported by the following: An established, representative advisory committee that meets on an ongoing basis The advisory committee, established after the 2008 Juvenile Justice Summit, consists of members of: The Equity Foundation - Multnomah County Child Welfare - Multnomah County Juvenile Justice - Portland State University - The Homeless “Continuum” (New Avenues for Youth, Outside In, Janus Youth, NAYA Family Center) - Sexual and Gender Minority Youth Resource Center (SMYRC) - Legal Representatives - The advisory committee communicates regularly both through email and in-person meetings. Advisory committee meetings are held at least quarterly, if not more often, to plan next steps and discuss challenges. An effort to share its message by presenting at conferences Following trainings in Multnomah County, the collaboration is looking to spread the word about the trainings and the importance of the topic by presenting a workshop specifically focused on gender-nonconforming youth at the 2012 Meaningful Care Conference, which attracts attendees from across the state. In order to spread the trainings to service providers across the state, the collaboration is hoping to establish champions or advocates for the work in other counties. In addition, it provides free downloads of all its training materials online. See best practices to learn more about ensuring that training materials are available. Strategic partnerships with organizations that are experienced in the subject matter The trainings supported by the collaboration were developed and delivered by partners from SMYRC and Portland State University’s Regional Research Institute for Human Services with key subject matter expertise in LGBTQ issues. SMYRC, a non-profit organization focused on working with LGBTQ youth through empowerment, community building, education and direct services, provided a background and overview of LGBTQ issues. The Regional Research Institute for Human Services conducts research and evaluation with the goal of improving peoples' lives through better human services, supports, and policies. The Regional Research Institute provided expertise in evaluation and helped to develop training materials for the project.

> Providing Unbiased Services for LGBTQ Youth Project About the Collaboration The Providing Unbiased Services for LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer) Youth Project is a local collaboration that began in 2004 as a Juvenile Justice Committee focused on researching the state of in- and out-of-home services for LGBTQ youth. This committee was established through the support of the Equity Foundation, a non-profit organization in Portland, Oregon whose mission is to support and ensure equality across all sexual and gender orientations, and the dedication of a defense lawyer in Portland who had recognized the overrepresentation of LGBTQ youth in her clients. A 2008 Juvenile Justice Summit held in Portland brought together over 40 agencies to brainstorm challenges faced in trying to best serve LGBTQ youth. Portland State University’s Regional Research Institute for Human Services was invited to participate in the Summit to provide an academic presence and to support an evaluation of the effort. Summit participants identified a need for basic understanding and training in working with LGBTQ youth and subsequently the Equity Foundation established an advisory committee that represents researchers, lawyers, community advocates, child welfare workers, juvenile justice staff, and homeless youth services providers. The advisory committee applied for a United Way grant in order to establish the Providing Unbiased Services for LGBTQ Youth Project and develop a model training program to help staff in social service and criminal justice organizations provide unbiased services for LGBTQ youth. Trainings were provided to a subset of Multnomah Child Welfare staff, staff from the Homeless “Continuum” (New Avenues for Youth, Outside In, Janus Youth, NAYA Family Center), and staff from Multnomah County Juvenile Justice. While the collaboration started at the local level within Multnomah County, the hope is that trainings will expand to include service providers across the state and eventually become mandatory for service providers in order to increase their knowledge about LGBTQ youth.

> Providing Unbiased Services for LGBTQ Youth Project Lessons Learned Learn more about the lessons that Providing Unbiased Services for LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer) Youth Project has learned and the challenges it has faced. There is a lack of data in this area One challenge that the collaboration faces is a lack of data and information on LGBTQ youth, specifically gender-nonconforming youth and youth in the juvenile justice and child welfare systems. This is a problem in Oregon and the nation as a whole. While there are some data showing that LGBTQ youth are overrepresented in the homeless population, data about overrepresentation in other systems are not as clearly established. One reason for the lack of data on this population is that youth often don’t feel safe disclosing their sexual or gender preference. In addition, when data are available, gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender youth are often lumped together as one category therefore not capturing the distinct experiences of each population. For example, as many out-of-home placements are segregated by sex, it can create unique challenges for gender non-conforming youth. Information is slowly becoming more available, but it is still heavily reliant on anecdotal information or case studies rather than large-scale data collection and analysis. The lack of data and information on this population of youth both at the national and local level makes it difficult to show that - more efforts and funding needs to be targeted at this population; - action should be taken to help eliminate the disproportionate representation of LGBTQ youth in the juvenile justice, homeless, and child welfare populations; and - efforts need to be taken to ensure that LGBTQ youth experience a safe and supportive environment. Instability within partner organizations can slow down the process The collaboration has faced a number of reorganizational challenges in recent years. Multnomah County Juvenile Justice recently underwent reorganization and a shift in its leadership due to budget cuts. While the previous director was a key advocate for the collaboration, making the training mandatory for all staff, new leadership has a different background, approach, and priorities. Another shift in the collaboration’s structure occurred when the executive director of SMYRC moved out of state and SMYRC merged with another organization—the Q Center, a community center supporting all LGBTQ people, not just youth. SMYRC developed and delivered part of the training, so their organization changes raised questions of who would provide that piece of the training going forward though the collaboration hopes that SMYRC will continue to be a training partner. As some of the partner organizations were in flux, the collaboration recognized that while it is important to ensure its presence is still felt, it is also important to allow the partner organizations to stabilize and reestablish buy-in prior to trying to expand their efforts and make large demands of the partner organizations. It can be difficult to find funders to support the work The collaboration was able to secure initial funding for trainings through a grant with the United Way, but it continues to struggle to find additional funds to expand and sustain its efforts. The Equity Foundation, as a partner in the collaboration, has been able to provide some funding to sustain the work of the collaboration, but securing additional funding and deciding which partner should be the key applicant continues to be difficult. Plan to establish local buy-in and reach out to local organizations and champions As Oregon is a large state with distinct cities and rural areas, the collaboration recognized it would be important to work with local communities, rather than imposing its views and values on communities across the state in a top-down manner. As it plans to expand the trainings to audiences throughout the state, the collaboration is cognizant of the importance of establishing local buy-in, developing local advocates, and generating local partners to support the work of the collaboration.

> Providing Unbiased Services for LGBTQ Youth Project Best Practices Learn more about the practices that have helped Providing Unbiased Services for LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer) Youth Project to be successful in working collaboratively and achieving results. Allies and advocates from a variety of organizations and perspectives are represented within the advisory committee The collaboration has been able to establish a team of allies and advocates that represent the diverse array of partner organizations on its advisory board, including child welfare, juvenile justice, higher education, and the homeless population . The collaboration ensures that people with these different perspectives are at the table and have an equal voice as they discuss next steps and express their concerns and goals. The diverse array of partners has benefited the collaboration as each brings its own skills, perspectives, connections, and expertise. For example, having an academic institution involved has helped to provide a level of credibility that can be beneficial in opening doors with decision-makers, while having grassroots organizations has brought a level of understanding about the realities of LGBTQ youth in the community. Support from key advocates within the systems Having strong allies on the advisory committee is important, but the collaboration has also found that it is essential to have allies that help carry out and support the work from inside the system. For example, the collaboration has a strong ally within Multnomah County Juvenile Justice who helped to establish, schedule, and tailor the trainings to ensure that they meet the needs of its juvenile justice system. She was also a strong advocate for getting its director on board and helped navigate the political changes and reorganizations that occurred within the organization. See lessons learned for more information on the impact of having partners undergo reorganization. One of the key advocates that the collaboration was able to establish was the former director of Multnomah County Juvenile Justice. Through his role, he was able to mandate that all of the staff in the Multnomah County Juvenile Justice Department participate in the training. Recognizing how to navigate the political nuances and organizational objectives Recognizing how to frame the training objectives so they fit with the missions and mandates of the organizations was essential for the success of the training. For example, the collaboration benefited from being able to adapt the training objectives to reflect the key language and align with the professional development policies of the Multnomah County Juvenile Justice. Ensuring training materials are easily available While the collaboration does not actively market its training materials or track page views on its website, all of the training materials including PowerPoint presentations, handouts, and additional resources are available online for free download and use. It also makes its materials available in a binder and in CD format for local organizations and entities interested in the training.

In addition, young leaders tend to be more involved in their communities, and have lower dropout rates than their peers. Youth leaders also show considerable benefits for their communities, providing valuable insight into the needs and interests of young people Statistics reflecting the number of youth suffering from mental health, substance abuse, and co-occurring disorders highlight the necessity for schools, families, support staff, and communities to work together to develop targeted, coordinated, and comprehensive transition plans for young people with a history of mental health needs and/or substance abuse. Nearly 30,000 youth aged out of foster care in Fiscal Year 2009, which represents nine percent of the young people involved in the foster care system that year. This transition can be challenging for youth, especially youth who have grown up in the child welfare system. Research has demonstrated that as many as one in five children/youth have a diagnosable mental health disorder. Read about how coordination between public service agencies can improve treatment for these youth. Civic engagement has the potential to empower young adults, increase their self-determination, and give them the skills and self-confidence they need to enter the workforce.

Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://youth.gov/youth-topics/lgbt)

> Youth who receive special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA 2004) and especially young adults of transition age, should be involved in planning for life after high school as early as possible and no later than age 16. Transition services should stem from the individual youth’s needs and strengths, ensuring that planning takes into account his or her interests, preferences, and desires for the future. Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Sexual orientation and gender identity/expression are important aspects of a young person’s identity. Understanding and expressing sexual orientation and gender and developing related identities are typical development tasks that vary across children and youth. For example, some youth may be unsure of their sexual orientation, whereas others have been clear about it since childhood and have expressed it since a young age.1 Expressing and exploring gender identity and roles is a part of normal development. 2 The process of understanding and expressing one’s sexual orientation and gender identity is unique to each individual. It is not a one-time event and personal, cultural, and social factors may influence how one expresses their sexual orientation and gender identity.3 There is currently no universally-accepted acronym inclusive of all youth who are not heterosexual and/or express their gender in diverse ways. The commonly-used acronym — LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, or another diverse gender identity) — refers to the communities included in the “LGBTTTQQIAA” acronym (see Figure 1). This youth topic primarily uses “LGBTQ+” as an inclusive term for simplicity, except when describing research studies explicitly focused on more narrowly-specific communities. See Key Terms and Concepts to learn more about each of these communities. Figure 1: Communities included in the “strong LGBTTTQQIAA” acronym* Based on Sexual Orientation| Based on Gender Identity/Expression| Lesbian Gay Bisexual 2/Two-Spirit Queer Questioning Intersex Asexual Pansexual + Agender + Bigender + Genderqueer + Gender Variant + Nonbinary + Pangender + Transgender + Transsexual *See the Key Terms and Concepts page for definitions and citations for each term in the table. Resiliency and Protective Factors Research on LGBTQ+ youth has focused on the risk factors and disparities these young people experience compared with youth who are not LGBTQ+. However, more recently there has been research on resiliency and protective factors, which offers a strength-based focus on LGBTQ+ youth well-being. For instance, LGBTQ+ youth who have access to spaces that affirm their sexual orientation and gender identity report lower rates of attempting suicide4 and experiencing supportive environments.5 Several factors that can help improve outcomes for LGBTQ+ young people include: Addressing LGBTQ+-related stigma, discrimination, and violence - Building on the strengths of LGBTQ+ youth - Fostering supports such as family acceptance and safe, affirming environments in schools and other settings - Federal and local policies and practices increasingly acknowledge and focus on the experiences and needs of LGBTQ+ youth. Numerous national advocacy and other organizations are also giving greater attention to LGBTQ+ youth in their work.6 Fostering safe, affirming communities and youth-serving settings such as schools for all youth requires efforts to address the challenges described here. At the same time, it is also important to acknowledge and build on the strengths, resilience, and factors that protect LGBTQ+ youth from risk, such as connection to caring adults and peers and family acceptance. Parental support of sexual orientation and gender expression provide uniquely strong benefits to positive well-being and mental health in young adulthood and are related to higher levels of self-esteem and lower levels of depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts.7 Young people who identify as LGBTQ+ can experience various challenges because of how others respond to their sexual orientation or gender identity/expression. This is also true for youth who are questioning their sexual orientation or gender identity, or may be perceived as LGBTQ+ or gender variant by others.8 In a 2021 survey of nearly 35,000 LGBTQ+ youth, 75 percent reported having experienced discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity at least once in their lifetime.9 These negative experiences include high rates of physical and emotional bias and violence; rejection by schools, employment, and communities because of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity/expression. Research shows that due to these challenges and the associated stress, LGBTQ+ youth are at risk for negative health outcomes and are more likely to attempt suicide, experience homelessness, and use illegal drugs10 These issues may also contribute to anxiety, depressive symptoms, and feelings of isolation. Youth who express their gender in ways that vary from societal expectations for their perceived sex or gender are at risk for high levels of childhood physical, psychological, and sexual abuse.11 They are also at risk for school victimization.12 As a result, they may have poorer well-being than lesbian, gay, and bisexual peers whose gender expression is more closely aligned with societal expectations.13 Resources Emerging Practices for Supporting LGBTQI+ Young People Across Human Services This project highlights promising and emerging practices that human services agencies, programs, staff, and leaders are using to make human service delivery and prevention more welcoming and accessible for LGBTQI+ young people (ages 10-24) in child welfare and juvenile justice systems, experiencing homelessness, and/or seeking sexual health services. The Open Letter of Action from Young People provides perspectives from five young adults on barriers faced by LGBTQI+ young people and opportunities to improve human services programs across sectors and levels of government to better serve LGBTQI+ young people and their families. Health Considerations for LGBTQ Youth This website provides information on protective factors and data related to health risks and sexual minority youth, as well as related resources. Practice Brief 1: Providing Services and Supports for Youth Who Are Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning, Intersex, or Two-Spirit (LGBTQI2-S)(PDF, 8 pages) This practice brief outlines key information for working with and providing culturally and linguistically competent services to LGBTQI2-S youth.

In fact, any youth who does not fit typical social expectations for his or her mannerisms, behavior, or choice of clothing based on birth-assigned gender, for example, can be considered “gender variant.” This does not mean the youth is lesbian, gay, or bisexual — or identifies as a gender different from what he or she was assigned at birth (i.e., transgender). 9 The National Trevor Project, 2021 (45 percent of this sample were youth of color, and 38 percent were transgender or nonbinary. 10 Hunter & Schaecher, 1987; Reis, 1999; Reis & Saewyc, 1999; Ray, 2006; Ryan, Huebner, Diaz, & Sanchez, 2009; SAMHSA, 2014 11 Roberts, Rosario, Corliss, Koenen, & Austin, 2012 12 Toomey, Ryan, Diaz, & Russell, 2010 13 Rieger & Savin-Williams, 2012 Other Resources on this Topic Announcements Briefs Collaboration Profiles Feature Articles Publications Resources Technical Assistance Tools & Guides Videos & Podcasts Websites Youth Topics Youth Briefs Research links early leadership with increased self-efficacy and suggests that leadership can help youth to develop decision making and interpersonal skills that support successes in the workforce and adulthood.

Youth leaders also show considerable benefits for their communities, providing valuable insight into the needs and interests of young people Statistics reflecting the number of youth suffering from mental health, substance abuse, and co-occurring disorders highlight the necessity for schools, families, support staff, and communities to work together to develop targeted, coordinated, and comprehensive transition plans for young people with a history of mental health needs and/or substance abuse. Nearly 30,000 youth aged out of foster care in Fiscal Year 2009, which represents nine percent of the young people involved in the foster care system that year. This transition can be challenging for youth, especially youth who have grown up in the child welfare system. Research has demonstrated that as many as one in five children/youth have a diagnosable mental health disorder. Read about how coordination between public service agencies can improve treatment for these youth. Civic engagement has the potential to empower young adults, increase their self-determination, and give them the skills and self-confidence they need to enter the workforce. Read about one youth’s experience in AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC). 53% of transgender people report being verbally harassed or treated disrespectfully in public places, and 44% have been denied service.

Transitioning to Adulthood [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://youth.gov/youth-topics/lgbtq-youth/transition-adulthood)

> Youth who receive special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA 2004) and especially young adults of transition age, should be involved in planning for life after high school as early as possible and no later than age 16. Transition services should stem from the individual youth’s needs and strengths, ensuring that planning takes into account his or her interests, preferences, and desires for the future. Transitioning to Adulthood Although many youth experience a smooth transition into adulthood and the workforce, some encounter challenges in finding or maintaining employment. Because LGBTQ+ youth may experience less supportive school environments than their non-LGBT peers, they may struggle in school and, in turn, have higher school dropout rates or have lower aspirations for postsecondary education than other populations of youth1 These potentially negative school experiences can affect the postsecondary outcomes of LGBTQ+ youth as they transition into employment or postsecondary education. Also, LGBTQ+ youth may have difficulty finding, and need support identifying, jobs and higher education opportunities that are affirming and safe. Colleges and Universities In looking for postsecondary educational opportunities, LGBT youth may want to consider a college’s or university’s climate relative to the experiences of LGBTQ+ students. The Campus Pride Index is a resource for youth to find higher-education learning environments that are welcoming to LGBTQ+ youth. The index assesses eight factors: LGBTQ+ Policy Inclusion - LGBTQ+ Support and Institutional Commitment - LGBTQ+ Academic Life - LGBTQ+ Student Life - LGBTQ+ Housing - LGBTQ+ Campus Safety - LGBTQ+ Counseling and Health - LGBTQ+ Recruitment and Retention Efforts - As of July 2021, the index has data for 435 campuses. Also, the Consortium of Higher Education LGBT Resource Professionals maintains a directory of colleges and universities that have an office dedicated to LGBTQ topics. Employment LGBTQ+ employees experience harassment and discrimination at greater levels than their non-LGBTQ+ colleagues.2 One survey found that 44 percent of LGBTQ adults experienced some form of discrimination on the job because of their sexual orientation.3 In June of 2020 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the 1964 Civil Rights Act protects gay, lesbian, and transgender employees from discrimination based on sex.4 Employers can benefit from policies and programs (including state laws) that support LGBTQ+ employees. Protections for LGBTQ+ employees have been found to attract other diverse applicants and fair-minded job seekers. For example, one survey showed that more than 80 percent of respondents, including those who identified as members of LGBTQ+ community and those who identified as allies, were more likely to buy goods and services from a company that outwardly supports the LGBTQ+ community. 72 percent of respondents in the same study reported being more likely to accept a job at a company that outwardly supports LGBTQ+ employees than one that did not or one that took no public stance.5 Outward support for and inclusion of the LGBTQ+ community within an organization may look like: Following inclusivity guidelines created by the United Nations’ Human Rights Commission (UNHCR) standards of corporate conduct; - Writing explicit organization-wide policies related to LGBTQ+ matters such as guidelines to advise managers as they navigate supporting employees who are undergoing a gender transition; - Providing inclusive benefits that cover both same-sex and different-sex partners, transgender-inclusive health plans, and/or additional specialized benefits for LGBTQ+ employees to accommodate undue burden and discrimination experienced elsewhere.6 - When seeking employment, LGBTQ+ youth may likewise consider the policies and practices of an organization, an agency, or a company before pursuing employment there. The Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index provides information on LGBTQ equality at U.S. businesses, which can provide guidance as LGBTQ youth transition into the workforce.7 Resources The Economic Well-Being of Lesbian, Gay, or Bisexual Youth Transitioning Out of Foster Care This resource discusses the well-being of LGB youth aging out of foster care and compares data with their heterosexual peers.

In addition, young leaders tend to be more involved in their communities, and have lower dropout rates than their peers. Youth leaders also show considerable benefits for their communities, providing valuable insight into the needs and interests of young people Statistics reflecting the number of youth suffering from mental health, substance abuse, and co-occurring disorders highlight the necessity for schools, families, support staff, and communities to work together to develop targeted, coordinated, and comprehensive transition plans for young people with a history of mental health needs and/or substance abuse. Nearly 30,000 youth aged out of foster care in Fiscal Year 2009, which represents nine percent of the young people involved in the foster care system that year. This transition can be challenging for youth, especially youth who have grown up in the child welfare system. Research has demonstrated that as many as one in five children/youth have a diagnosable mental health disorder. Read about how coordination between public service agencies can improve treatment for these youth. Civic engagement has the potential to empower young adults, increase their self-determination, and give them the skills and self-confidence they need to enter the workforce.

> Stand Up for LGBTQ Youth Stand Up for LGBTQ Youth Picture this: You come to school one day, ready to learn, but because you’re gay, you’re told to leave the classroom. This is what happened to Josh, an openly gay student. Josh’s health teacher didn’t include him in a lesson because she thought gay people shouldn’t care about their sexual health. Challenges like this have inspired Josh to become a voice for the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning) community, spreading positive messages and truth. “I hoped what I had to say would change things for the better and change the views of the people who had brought me down,” he says. | Josh| Amanda| endever*| Like Josh, young people who identify as LGBTQ often face many challenges — such as bias, rejection from their families, depression, and violence at school. But, feeling empowered to speak up can be a game changer, transforming you from victim to advocate. endever*, a young person who identifies as nongender, says that having at least one person in your life who cares and believes in you can make all the difference. Programs can also help LGBTQ youth, says Amanda, who joined a gay-straight alliance (GSA) in college, a place she says was a “safe space.” LGBTQ young people and their allies, who may not identify as LGBTQ but support the community, have the power to use their voices to create safe spaces for LGBTQ youth in schools, communities, and the nation. Here are a few ideas for Change Makers who want to empower LGBTQ youth: Stand Up Against Harassment and Bullying of LGBTQ Youth According to a recent survey, almost 85% of LGBT students said they were verbally harassed because of their sexual orientation. Learn more about experiences of LGBT youth in school and consider how you can use your voice to stand up to bullying and support your peers. Organize a Gay-Straight Alliance Help make your school safer and more welcoming for everyone by starting a GSA. GLSEN and the GSA Network have a website that provides information that can help you start a GSA at your school, or help an established GSA become even better. These resources can help you learn how to start a GSA, recruit members, run effective meetings, partner with adults, celebrate your successes, and more. Get Involved With the Trevor Project The Trevor Project is an organization that helps LGBTQ youth get through tough times. Its website provides information on ways to get involved through volunteering, advocacy, and connecting through social media. Consider applying to be part of the Trevor Project Youth Advisory Council and your voice could shape the organization’s direction. Did these stories inspire you to take action?
