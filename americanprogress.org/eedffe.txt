In June 2020, the Center for American Progress fielded a survey of 1,528 LGBTQ individuals. These respondents were asked to relay their experiences—and instances of discrimination—in a wide variety of situations in both the public and private spheres. CAP recently released a detailed report of the survey’s major findings, most prominently that more than 1 in 3 LGBTQ individuals—including nearly 2 in 3 transgender individuals—have experienced some form of discrimination in the last year. This interactive provides a detailing of survey responses, broken down by the form of discrimination and various demographic groupings.
