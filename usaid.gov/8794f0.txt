HeeSay, an LGBTQ+ social networking and dating app, offers a diverse range of social features designed to create a more inclusive and engaging online community that fosters deeper connections among users. Leveraging its popularity, USAID partnered with Sai Gon Pride, a leader in LGBTQI+ outreach and services, to conduct daily midnight livestreams in July. These livestreams aimed to connect high-risk individuals with critical HIV services. Each session attracted up to 2,400 participants, resulting in 40 new enrollments in HIV biomedical prevention programs and 22 individuals starting antiretroviral therapy. Dating apps popular in the LGBTQ+ community have proven to be a cost-effective and engaging method for reaching those at potential risk of HIV and connecting them to essential health services.
