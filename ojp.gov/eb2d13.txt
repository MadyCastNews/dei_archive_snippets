This study presents the findings from an exploratory study of bystander intervention in campus incidents of sexual violence, with a focus on the perspectives of 101 racial minority and/or LGBTQ students at three campuses of a large public university. Bystander intervention in campus sexual violence has received increased attention as a promising prevention strategy; however, research is limited regarding this type of intervention with racial and sexual minority students, such as students of color, LGBTQ-spectrum students, and the intersections thereof. Using concept mapping methodology, the current study was conducted in three phases: brainstorming of statements about bystander intervention, sorting and rating of statements, and mapping and interpretation of the results. Using multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis, a six-cluster solution was used, representing key themes related to supporting studentsâ€™ efforts as helpful bystanders. Overall, findings indicate a need for bystander intervention efforts to widen their focus by using an intersectional, social justice lens. Study participants identified various forms of racism, homophobia, transphobia, and microaggressions as intertwined with their ability to be active bystanders on college campuses.
