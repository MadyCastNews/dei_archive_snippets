Opening remarks by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to the first “Proud at NATO” online conference by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to the first “Proud at NATO” online conference (As delivered) Thank you, Dylan [White], and welcome to all participants at this first-ever Proud at NATO event. Whether you are a member of the International Staff, the International Military Staff, an agency or a national delegation – I am pleased and proud that so many of you have joined today’s conference. I want to thank the dedicated volunteers who have come together to form a Staff Resource Group, promoting LGBTQ+ perspectives in the workplace. You are doing invaluable work in supporting diversity and inclusion at NATO. Every member of the LGBTQ+ community at NATO is a valued member of our staff and family. Because diversity and inclusion is at the heart of who we are and what we do. We are an alliance of 30 nations working together to protect our people and our values: freedom, equality and human rights. Drawing on all resources and all experiences makes us stronger, and better equipped to face the future. I believe real leadership includes understanding others, respecting others, and standing up for others. So I am glad that you are welcoming all “allies” to the discussion. And I don’t just mean NATO member nations, but people who do not identify as LGBTQ+ themselves, yet want to see a more inclusive world. You will always have an ally in me. NATO has come a long way on inclusiveness – but we can do more, and we still have a way to go. So today is only the beginning of an important conversation. I wish you a great, first Proud at NATO event.
