Award Information Description of original award (Fiscal Year 2022, $400,000) PROPOSAL ABSTRACT The New York City Anti-Violence Project (AVP) requests $300,000 from the Bureau of Justice Assistance over three years, through the Community-based Approaches to Prevent and Address Hate Crimes Grant Program, to create the Community-Based Hate Violence Prevention (CBHVP) Project, (“the Project”) which will scale the community-led safety model AVP developed as part of New York City Against Hate (NYCAH), a coalition AVP co-anchors. The Project will utilize community assessment and relationship-building, training, data collection, and advocacy to support survivors and create replicable resources for other communities to do the same. The Project will develop a model in New York City (NYC) that can be scaled for national replication. AVP receives funding through the Office for Violence Against Women in two grants: 1) Legal Assistance to Victims grant funds direct civil legal services for survivors of intimate partner and sexual violence (IPV/SV); and 2) Grants for Outreach and Services to Underserved Populations, that funds AVP work with Caribbean-American LGBTQ people at risk for or experiencing IPV/SV in NYC. The Project will utilize community assessment and relationship-building, training, data collection, and advocacy to support survivors and create replicable resources for other communities to do the same, thus increasing reporting of and community-based responses to hate violence, drawing on community strength, expertise, and resilience. Data collection, analysis, & mapping is essential the Project, ensuring the Project can identify and better understand the gaps between data collected and documented by city government (e.g. NYC Police Department Hate Crimes Task Force and by the NYC Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes, with data collected by CBOs. To support the project goal of strengthening linkages between diverse CBOs and LGBTQ community members, working to prevent hate violence and crime, AVP will collaborate with Project partners to 1) collect, analyze, and map data on HV occurring in NYC; 2) create a Community Safety Planning for Events Training and set of workbook materials; 3) create a guide for individual survivors on how to report the violence they have experienced to local CBOs and other government agencies; 4) Pilot and evaluate trainings in NYC; 5) Create and facilitate a train the trainer workshop; 6) Create a Policy paper with recommendations on how to create community-led safety initiatives; and 7) write and share a final report. The application seeks priority funding under priority 1(B), due to circumstances listed on page 11.
