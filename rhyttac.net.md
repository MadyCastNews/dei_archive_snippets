Data suggests nearly two percent of students in grades 9-12 identify as transgender; these youth reported higher rates of violent victimization, risky sexual behavior, suicidality and substance use than peers. Safer learning environments and increased access to culturally competent mental and physical health care are recommended.

Even though public support and acceptance has dramatically increased in recent years, many individuals still face a discrepancy in the way they are treated in their day-to-day life experiences, in comparison to heterosexuals." In this article, the Rehab Center explains some pertinent areas of concern that may influence substance abuse risk, and thusly must be considered as a person seeks and encounters treatment.

Service providers, supervisors and administrators, should receive training on, and examine issues related to, race, racism, white privilege, and the intersection with gender and sexuality, in order to effectively respond to the needs of LGBT youth of color who are homeless. Agencies can use this document to help determine the fundamental issues they need to address to best work with LGBT youth and to evaluate how well they are currently meeting the needs of the LGBT youth they serve.Â | Special Populations Resource ListÂ This document contains a wide variety of resources to assist programs in developing and implementing programming as they work with Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning, Intersexed (GLBTQ+), and 2-Spirit RHY and their families.
