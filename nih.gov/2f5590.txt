Intervention IP-082: Proud and Empowered! (P&E) Summary The Proud & Empowered intervention, a school-based intervention, helps sexual and gender minority students cope with minority stress experiences that ultimately impact mental health outcomes in this population. Students at four schools were recruited to participant in the study and the intervention (vs. control) was randomly-assigned at the school level. Students who received the intervention vs. control showed reductions in minority stress (i.e., internalized homonegativity) from pre-to-post intervention and changes in mental health outcomes. Overview To reduce the impacts of minority stress among LGBTQ+ youth with the goal of improving mental health, health disparities and social support Research-Tested — Interventions with strong methodological rigor that have demonstrated short-term or long-term positive effects on one or more targeted health outcomes to improve minority health and/or health disparities through quantitative measures; Studies have a control or comparison group and are published in a peer-review journal; No pilot, demonstration or feasibility studies.

Moderation analyses showed that the intervention significantly moderated the relationship between minority stress and PTSD (b = -1.28, p = .032), depression (b = -0.79, p = .023), and suicidality (b = 0.14, p = .012) symptoms; those in the intervention condition had mitigated relationships between measures of stress and health outcomes compared to those in the control condition. Preliminary analyses ensured no group differences at Time 1. A two-by-two repeated-measures ANOVA assessed intervention and control group changes between pre-test and post-test in minority stress, subscales, and mental health (anxiety, depression, PTSD, suicidality). Subsequent regression analyses tested whether intervention was a moderator in the relationship between minority stress and Time 2 mental health symptoms, controlling for Time 1 symptoms; analyses run for each mental health outcome Evaluations and Assessments No Demographic and Implementation Description Environmental Exposures, Skin cutting, Suicide, Depression, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, Substance Use/Abuse African American or Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, White, Unspecified Racial and Ethnic Minority Populations, Sexual and Gender Minority (SGM) Groups Adolescents (10 - 17 years) Socio-demographics / Population Characteristics Suburban, Urban / Inner City Unspecified Female, Male, Non-binary, Transgender, Unspecified, Participants must self-identify as non-heterosexual and/or non-cisgender.
