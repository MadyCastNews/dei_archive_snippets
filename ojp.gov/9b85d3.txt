NCJ Number 245839 Journal Journal of School Violence Volume: 12 Issue: 1 Dated: 2013 Pages: 7-26 Date Published 2013 Length 20 pages Annotation A national sample of school psychologists was surveyed to assess their observations of bias and harassment of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) students in their schools. Abstract Two survey forms were administered, one asking respondents to estimate incidence of bias and harassment, and another with two additional questions with examples of homophobic epithets. Quantitative analysis showed that only 16 percent of school psychologists reported they observed bias and harassment once a month or more frequently. However, 43 percent of participants reported hearing epithets such as "that's so gay" among students once a month or more frequently. Also, 8 percent and 45 percent of respondents reported that these epithets were spoken by other staff members at least once a month or once a year, respectively. School psychologists responded to direct verbal insults but often ignored homophobic language not specifically directed at people. Findings were framed by the culture of heteronormativity and microaggressions in schools. Abstract published by arrangement with Taylor and Francis.
