2022 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2022/)

> Introduction The Trevor Project’s 2022 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health demonstrates that rates of suicidal thoughts have trended upward among LGBTQ young people over the last three years, making our life-saving work all the more important. Capturing the experiences of nearly 34,000 LGBTQ youth ages 13 to 24 across the United States, with 45% of respondents being LGBTQ youth of color and 48% being transgender or nonbinary, our fourth annual national survey is one of the most diverse surveys of LGBTQ youth ever conducted. These data provide critical insights into some of the unique suicide risk factors faced by LGBTQ youth, top barriers to mental health care, and the negative impacts of COVID-19 and relentless anti-transgender legislation. This research also highlights several ways in which we can all support the LGBTQ young people in our lives—and help prevent suicide. It’s essential to emphasize that we still do not have known counts or registries of the LGBTQ youth population—and comprehensive, intersectional data on LGBTQ youth mental health outcomes remain limited. So our annual national survey strives to fill in these gaps and amplify the experiences of young LGBTQ people, a marginalized group consistently found to be at significantly increased risk for suicide because of how they are mistreated and stigmatized in society. We hope these data and trends will be used by fellow researchers, policymakers, and youth-serving organizations to advance policies and practices that better support LGBTQ youth around the globe and work to end the public health crisis of suicide. Over the next year, The Trevor Project will release new data from this diverse, national sample in the form of research briefs and research reports on a wide variety of topics related to LGBTQ youth mental health and suicide prevention. And as always, we will continue to do all we can to advocate for LGBTQ-inclusive policies, raise public awareness and acceptance, and be there for every single LGBTQ young person who needs help or support, 24/7.

DonateKey Findings 45% of LGBTQ youth seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year. Nearly 1 in 5 transgender and nonbinary youth attempted suicide and LGBTQ youth of color reported higher rates than their white peers. LGBTQ youth who felt high social support from their family reported attempting suicide at less than half the rate of those who felt low or moderate social support. Fewer than 1 in 3 transgender and nonbinary youth found their home to be gender-affirming. LGBTQ youth who found their school to be LGBTQ-affirming reported lower rates of attempting suicide. 60% of LGBTQ youth who wanted mental health care in the past year were not able to get it. LGBTQ youth who live in a community that is accepting of LGBTQ people reported significantly lower rates of attempting suicide than those who do not. Mental Health & Suicide Risk: Suicide Risk 45% of LGBTQ youth seriously considered suicide in the past year including more than half of transgender and nonbinary youth and 1 in 3 cisgender youth. 14% of LGBTQ youth attempted suicide in the past year including nearly 1 in 5 transgender and nonbinary youth and 1 in 10 cisgender youth. Rates of considered and attempted suicide among LGBTQ youth Explore Data by: Ages 13-17 - Ages 18-24 - Gay - Lesbian - Bisexual - Pansexual - Queer - Questioning - Asexual - Cisgender boy/ man - Cisgender girl/ woman - Transgender boy/ man - Transgender girl/ woman - Nonbinary/ genderqueer - Questioning - Asian American/ Pacific Islander - Black - Latinx - Middle Eastern/ Northern African - Native/ Indigenous - White - More than one race/ ethnicity - Although our data continue to show high rates of mental health and suicide risk among LGBTQ young people, it is crucial to note that these rates vary widely based on the way LGBTQ youth are treated. Dr. Myeshia Price (she/her or they/them) Senior Research Scientist, The Trevor Project Anxiety & Depression 73% of LGBTQ youth reported experiencing symptoms of anxiety including more than three-quarters of transgender and nonbinary youth and nearly two-thirds of cisgender youth. 58% of LGBTQ youth reported experiencing symptoms of depression including nearly two-thirds of transgender and nonbinary youth and nearly half of cisgender youth. Anxiety & depression symptoms reported among LGBTQ youth Explore Data by: Ages 13-17 - Ages 18-24 - Gay - Lesbian - Bisexual - Pansexual - Queer - Questioning - Asexual - Cisgender boy/ man - Cisgender girl/ woman - Transgender boy/ man - Transgender girl/ woman - Nonbinary/ genderqueer - Questioning - Asian American/ Pacific Islander - Black - Latinx - Middle Eastern/ Northern African - Native/ Indigenous - White - More than one race/ ethnicity - Trends in LGBTQ youth mental health & suicide risk from 2020 to 2022 Symptoms of anxiety - Symptoms of depression - Considered suicide - Attempted suicide - Mental Health Care: Access to Care Among all LGBTQ youth, 82% wanted mental health care and 18% did not. 60% of LGBTQ youth who wanted mental health care in the past year were not able to get it including nearly 3 in 5 transgender and nonbinary youth and more than 3 in 5 cisgender youth. Desire for and access to mental health care Desire for mental health care 82% Wanted care - 18% Didn’t want care - Access to mental health care 60% Wanted but did not receive care - 40% Wanted and received care - LGBTQ youth who wanted mental health care but were unable to get it cited the following top ten reasons LGBTQ youth who did not feel care providers would understand their culture by race/ethnicity Impact of Current Events: COVID-19 56% of LGBTQ youth reported that their mental health was poor most of the time or always due to the COVID-19 pandemic including more than 3 in 5 transgender and nonbinary youth and nearly half of cisgender youth. LGBTQ youth who reported that their mental health was “poor” most of the time or always due to the COVID-19 pandemic LGBTQ youth who reported a close family member or friend died due to COVID-19 by race/ethnicity Anti-Transgender Legislation 93% of transgender and nonbinary youth said that they have worried about transgender people being denied access to gender-affirming medical care due to state or local laws. 91% of transgender and nonbinary youth said that they have worried about transgender people being denied access to the bathroom due to state or local laws. 83% of transgender and nonbinary youth said that they have worried about transgender people being denied the ability to play sports due to state or local laws. Recent political attacks aimed at transgender and nonbinary youth have not only threatened their access to health care, support systems, and affirming spaces at school, they’ve also negatively impacted their mental health. Dr. Jonah DeChants (he/him) Research Scientist, The Trevor Project Unique Challenges LGBTQ youth who experienced anti-LGBTQ victimization — including being physically threatened or harmed, discriminated against, or subjected to conversion therapy — reported more than twice the rate of attempting suicide in the past year compared to those who did not have any of these anti-LGBTQ experiences. Unique Challenges: Physical Harm 36% of LGBTQ youth reported that they have been physically threatened or harmed due to either their sexual orientation or gender identity. 31% of LGBTQ youth reported that they have been physically threatened or harmed due to their sexual orientation. 37% of transgender and nonbinary youth reported that they have been physically threatened or harmed due to their gender identity. We must recognize that LGBTQ young people face stressors simply for being who they are that their peers never have to worry about. Amit Paley (he/him) CEO & Executive Director, The Trevor Project Rates of LGBTQ youth who have been physically threatened or harmed Rates of LGBTQ youth who have been physically threatened or harmed by race/ethnicity Asian American/ Pacific Islander - Black - Latinx - Middle Eastern/ Northern African - Native/ Indigenous - White - More than one race/ ethnicity - LGBTQ youth who attempted suicide in the past year, comparison across those who have ever been physically threatened or harmed due to either their sexual orientation or gender identity Discrimination 73% of LGBTQ youth reported that they have experienced discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity at least once in their lifetime. 65% of LGBTQ youth reported that they have experienced discrimination based on their sexual orientation. 71% of transgender and nonbinary youth reported that they have experienced discrimination based on their gender identity. Rates of LGBTQ youth who have experienced discrimination Rates of LGBTQ youth who have experienced discrimination by race/ethnicity Asian American/ Pacific Islander - Black - Latinx - Middle Eastern/ Northern African - Native/ Indigenous - White - More than one race/ ethnicity - LGBTQ youth who attempted suicide in the past year, comparison across those who have ever experienced discrimination Conversion Therapy LGBTQ youth who reported being threatened with or subjected to conversion therapy 83% Not subjected to or threatened with conversion therapy - 11% Threatened with conversion therapy - 6% Subjected to conversion therapy - 17% of LGBTQ youth reported being threatened with or subjected to conversion therapy including more than 1 in 5 transgender and nonbinary youth and more than 1 in 10 cisgender youth. Conversion therapy has been consistently associated with negative mental health outcomes and greater risk for suicide. That’s why this so-called ‘therapy’ is widely opposed by all major medical and mental organizations, and why it is a major focus of The Trevor Project’s advocacy work. Amit Paley (he/him) CEO & Executive Director, The Trevor Project LGBTQ youth who attempted suicide in the past year, comparison across those subjected to conversion therapy Ways to Support LGBTQ Youth: Access to Affirming Homes & Schools LGBTQ youth who live in a community that is accepting of LGBTQ people reported significantly lower rates of attempting suicide compared to those who do not. Nearly 2 in 5 LGBTQ youth reported living in a community that is somewhat or very unaccepting of LGBTQ people. LGBTQ youth who identified home or school as an LGBTQ-affirming space Transgender and nonbinary youth who identified home or school as a gender-affirming space LGBTQ youth who attempted suicide in the past year, comparison across access to LGBTQ-affirming spaces Not LGBTQ-affirming - LGBTQ-affirming - Transgender and nonbinary youth who attempted suicide in the past year, comparison across access to gender-affirming spaces Not gender-affirming - Gender-affirming - These findings emphasize the wide range of experiences and identities held by LGBTQ young people across the country, as well as the clear need to break down barriers to care and promote acceptance at the local level to help save young LGBTQ lives. Dr. Myeshia Price (she/her or they/them) Senior Research Scientist, The Trevor Project Reports of community acceptance of LGBTQ people among LGBTQ youth Suicide attempt rate by community acceptance of LGBTQ people The Importance of LGBTQ Representation & Advocacy Support from Parents & Caregivers Five most common ways that LGBTQ youth reported feeling supported by their parents or caregivers The fact that very simple things — like support from family and friends, seeing LGBTQ representation in media, and having your gender expression and pronouns respected — can have such a positive impact on the mental health of an LGBTQ young person is inspiring, and it should command more attention in conversations around suicide prevention and public debates around LGBTQ inclusion. Amit Paley (he/him) CEO & Executive Director, The Trevor Project Suicide attempt rate by LGBTQ youth social support Low to moderate support - High support - LGBTQ youth reported lower rates of attempting suicide when they felt more supported by their friends and family. Where did LGBTQ youth find moments of joy? Although LGBTQ youth reported many serious challenges, they also described hundreds of ways in which they find joy and strength in their lives. From their favorite content and activities to seeing representation and allyship, the wide range of responses emphasizes that we can all help create safe, supportive environments where LGBTQ youth can feel happy and express themselves. BTS & Lil Nas X - wearing my first binder - Dungeons & Dragons - seeing LGBTQ people of color represented in media - going to drag shows - getting to take care of house plants - journaling my thoughts and feelings - watching anime - K-Pop - changing my name to something that fit me - having a doctor who is an ally - my determination - my cat - writing songs - daydreaming about the future - happy LGBTQ elders - loving my body - just knowing that there’s people out there like me - Therapy & medication - Gender-affirming clothing - Family & parental support - The LGBTQ community - Accepting & affirming friends - Hope & excitement for the future - Happy LGBTQ elders & married couples - Online communities & support - Learning about LGBTQ history - Faith & spirituality - Music (BTS, Lil Nas X, etc) - Partners/falling in love - Cishet allies - Learning I’m not alone and there are more people like me - Protective laws/victories for LGBTQ rights - Supportive teachers - Having a safe space to express gender, gender identity, and sexuality - All gender restrooms - Queer role models - Pets/Animals - Taking care of younger siblings - Art, art expression, art therapy/crafting/ drawing - Video games/gamer community - LGBTQ clubs on campus - Athletics & Exercise - Going to college - Drag shows - Dance - Living as their authentic self - Escapism/fantasy/ fandom - Gender-affirming hormones - Financial stability - LGBTQ celebrities, influencers & representation in media - Self-love & acceptance - Cooking - Methodology The content and methodology for The Trevor Project’s 2022 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health were approved by an independent Institutional Review Board. A quantitative cross-sectional design was used to collect data through an online survey platform between September 20 and December 31, 2021. A sample of individuals ages 13 to 24 who resided in the United States was recruited via targeted ads on social media. No recruitment was conducted via The Trevor Project’s website or social media channels. Respondents were defined as being LGBTQ if they identified with a sexual orientation other than straight/heterosexual, a gender identity other than cisgender, or both. In order to ensure the representativeness of the sample, targeted recruitment was conducted to ensure adequate sample sizes with respect to geography, gender identity, and race/ethnicity. Qualified respondents completed a secure online questionnaire that included a maximum of 143 questions. Questions on considering and attempting suicide in the past year were taken from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey to allow for comparisons to their nationally representative sample. Each question related to mental health and suicide was preceded by a message stating, “If at any time you need to talk to someone about your mental health or thoughts of suicide, please call The Trevor Project at 1-866-488-7386.” Although 114,288 individuals from unique IP addresses began the survey, 30,976 did not complete the initial demographic screening questions, and 38,484 were screened out based on ages outside of the sample range and residency outside of the United States. This resulted in an eligible sample of 44,828 LGBTQ youth ages 13-24. A validity check was placed midway through the survey which asked participants to select “agree” from a five-point statement with answers ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.” Youth who did not select “agree” (n=918) or who did not reach the validity question in the mid-point of the survey (n=9506) were removed from the analytic sample. Additionally, 194 indicated that they weren't honest in their responses, and 217 were identified as mischievous responders based on written responses. This resulted in a final analytic sample of 33,993 LGBTQ youth ages 13 to 24 who resided in the United States. This report uses “transgender and nonbinary” as an umbrella term to encompass non-cisgender youth, which includes young people who identify as transgender and nonbinary as well as other labels outside of the cisgender binary, including genderqueer, agender, genderfluid, gender neutral, bigender, androgynous, and gender non-conforming, among others. Comparability In order to better understand how our sample compares to a national probabilistic sample, we included questions regarding considering and attempting suicide that were identical to those used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in their Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBS). Analyses were conducted to compare rates of seriously considering suicide and attempting suicide in the past 12 months among youth ages 13 to 18 in our sample to the 2019 YRBS sample of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) high school students. YRBS prevalence rates among LGB youth for seriously considering suicide (47%) were comparable to rates among the same age range in our sample (49%). Additionally, 23% of LGBT youth in the 2019 YRBS reported a suicide attempt in the past 12 months compared to 17% in our sample of youth ages 13-18.

2023 U.S. National Survey on the Mental Health of LGBTQ Young People [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2023/)

> Introduction The Trevor Project’s 2023 U.S. National Survey on the Mental Health of LGBTQ Young People amplifies the experiences of more than 28,000 LGBTQ young people ages 13 to 24 across the United States. This survey gives a voice to LGBTQ young people — at a time when their existence is unfairly at the center of national political debates and state legislatures have introduced and implemented a record number of anti-LGBTQ policies. For the fifth consecutive year, these data underscore that anti-LGBTQ victimization contributes to the higher rates of suicide risk reported by LGBTQ young people and that most who want mental health care are unable to get it. Importantly, this research also points to ways we can all support the LGBTQ young people in our lives by highlighting protective factors like creating affirming spaces and respecting pronouns, as well as the topics about which LGBTQ young people wish those in their lives knew more. This year, for the first time ever, we also asked respondents to describe a world where all LGBTQ people are accepted. Despite the prevalence of unique challenges, barriers to care, and relentless political attacks, LGBTQ young people remain hopeful and resilient, and The Trevor Project is committed to helping them create the world they deserve. Thank you to the LGBTQ young people who bravely shared their experiences. We hope this survey will equip fellow researchers, policymakers, and other youth-serving organizations with the data necessary to celebrate and uplift LGBTQ young people and advocate for policies that support their health and work to end the public health crisis of suicide. - The Trevor Project Want to help support The Trevor Project?

Transgender and nonbinary young people who reported that all of the people they live with respect their pronouns reported lower rates of attempting suicide. Fewer than 40% of LGBTQ young people found their home to be LGBTQ-affirming. Roughly half of transgender and nonbinary young people found their school to be gender-affirming, and those who did reported lower rates of attempting suicide. A majority of LGBTQ young people reported being verbally harassed at school because people thought they were LGBTQ. Nearly 1 in 3 LGBTQ young people said their mental health was poor most of the time or always due to anti-LGBTQ policies and legislation. Nearly 2 in 3 LGBTQ young people said that hearing about potential state or local laws banning people from discussing LGBTQ people at school made their mental health a lot worse. Mental Health & Suicide Risk: Suicide Risk 41% of LGBTQ young people seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year including half of transgender and nonbinary young people and nearly 3 in 10 cisgender young people. 14% of LGBTQ young people attempted suicide in the past year including nearly 1 in 5 transgender and nonbinary young people and nearly 1 in 10 cisgender young people. Rates of considered and attempted suicide among LGBTQ young people Explore Data by: Anxiety & Depression 67% of LGBTQ young people reported experiencing symptoms of anxiety including nearly three-quarters of transgender and nonbinary young people and nearly 3 in 5 cisgender young people. 54% of LGBTQ young people reported experiencing symptoms of depression including more than 3 in 5 transgender and nonbinary young people and more than 2 in 5 cisgender young people. Anxiety & depression symptoms reported among LGBTQ young people Access to Care Despite the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and suicide risk among LGBTQ young people, a majority could not access the mental health care they desired. And among the small percentage of transgender and nonbinary young people who receive gender-affirming medical care, nearly 2 in 3 were worried about losing access to this care. Access to Care: Mental Health Care Among all LGBTQ young people, 81% wanted mental health care. 56% of LGBTQ young people who wanted mental health care in the past year were not able to get it including nearly 3 in 5 transgender and nonbinary young people and more than 2 in 5 cisgender young people. Desire for and access to mental health care Desire for mental health care - 81% Yes - 19% No Access to mental health care - 56% wanted but did not receive care - 44% wanted & received care LGBTQ young people who wanted mental health care but were unable to get it cited the following top ten reasons: Gender-Affirming Medical Care Among transgender and nonbinary young people, 11% reported being on gender-affirming hormones, and 2% reported taking puberty blockers. 65% who were on gender-affirming hormones were somewhat or very concerned about losing access to this care. Anti-LGBTQ Policies A record number of anti-LGBTQ policies have been introduced and implemented in the last year—and they’re having a negative impact on LGBTQ young people’s mental health. However, laws that protect LGBTQ young people from the dangerous and discredited practice of conversion therapy made them feel better. Nearly 1 in 3 LGBTQ young people said their mental health was poor most of the time or always due to anti-LGBTQ policies and legislation. Nearly 2 in 3 LGBTQ young people said that hearing about potential state or local laws banning people from discussing LGBTQ people at school made their mental health a lot worse. Conversely, 79% of LGBTQ young people said hearing about potential state and local laws trying to ban conversion therapy made them feel a little or a lot better. To what extent do you pay attention to media reports about rights for people who are LGBTQ? Anti-LGBTQ Victimization LGBTQ young people who experienced anti-LGBTQ victimization—including being physically threatened or harmed, discriminated against, or subjected to conversion therapy—reported more than twice the rate of attempting suicide in the past year compared to those who did not have any of these anti-LGBTQ experiences. Anti-LGBTQ Victimization: Negative Experiences at School Among those enrolled, LGBTQ young people reported that these negative experiences happened to them while in school: Physical Harm 24% of LGBTQ young people reported that they have been physically threatened or harmed in the past year due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. 18% of LGBTQ young people reported that they have been physically threatened or harmed in the past year due to their sexual orientation. 27% of transgender and nonbinary young people reported that they have been physically threatened or harmed in the past year due to their gender identity. LGBTQ young people who have been physically threatened or harmed in the past year Explore Data by: LGBTQ young people who attempted suicide in the past year, comparison across those who: Discrimination 60% of LGBTQ young people reported that they have felt discriminated against in the past year due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. 51% of LGBTQ young people reported that they have felt discriminated against in the past year due to their sexual orientation. 64% of transgender and nonbinary young people reported that they have felt discriminated against in the past year due to their gender identity.

LGBTQ young people who were subjected to conversion therapy Explore Data by: LGBTQ young people who attempted suicide in the past year, comparison across those subjected to conversion therapy: Ways to Support LGBTQ Young People: LGBTQ young people who had access to affirming homes, schools, community events, and online spaces reported lower rates of attempting suicide compared to those who did not. Affirming gender identity among transgender and nonbinary young people is consistently associated with lower rates of attempting suicide. LGBTQ young people reported that the following LGBTQ topics would be helpful for the people in their lives to know more about: Access to Affirming Spaces Affirming spaces among LGBTQ young people: Affirming spaces among transgender and nonbinary young people: LGBTQ young people who attempted suicide in the past year, comparison across access to LGBTQ-affirming spaces: Transgender and nonbinary young people who attempted suicide in the past year, comparison across access to LGBTQ-affirming spaces: *There was no significant difference in the suicide attempt rate among transgender and nonbinary young people who had access to gender-affirming online spaces and community events compared to those who did not. Supporting Transgender and Nonbinary Young People Transgender and nonbinary young people who reported that all of the people they live with respect their pronouns reported attempting suicide less than those who lived with others who did not respect their pronouns. How many of the people you live with respect your pronouns? - 50% None of the people I live with - 23% Some of the people I live with - 27% All of the people I live with Transgender and nonbinary young people who attempted suicide in the past year, comparison across the number of people they live with who respected their pronouns: Transgender and nonbinary young people who reported having access to a gender-neutral bathroom at school reported attempting suicide less than those who did not. Is there a gender-neutral bathroom at your school? - 63% No - 37% Yes Transgender and nonbinary young people who attempted suicide in the past year, comparison across access to a gender-neutral bathroom at school: Transgender and nonbinary young people who had access to binders, shapewear, and gender-affirming clothing reported lower rates of attempting suicide in the past year compared to those who did not.* *Binders and shapewear refer to undergarments, such as tank tops or bodysuits, that help young people who are experiencing gender dysphoria align the appearance of their body with their gender identity. We asked LGBTQ young people to describe what a world would look like where all LGBTQ people are accepted. Size of each word or phrase indicates its frequency as a response. - Respectful - Different - Nice - Happier - Colorful - Less Hateful - Great - In Public - Better - Beautiful - Wonderful - Safe - Kinder - Equal - Peaceful - Free - Perfect - Good - Normal - Safer - Easier - Able - Not Afraid - Happy - Amazing - Comfortable - People just exist - People ask pronouns - People mind their own business - Feel like people would be happier and kinder - People don’t assume your identity - Can be who they want to be - Basic human rights - No one would have to worry about coming out - Gender neutral bathrooms - People are able to express themselves Methodology The content and methodology for The Trevor Project’s 2023 U.S. National Survey on the Mental Health of LGBTQ Young People were approved by an independent Institutional Review Board. A quantitative cross-sectional design was used to collect data through an online survey platform between September 1 and December 12, 2022. A sample of individuals ages 13 to 24 who resided in the United States was recruited via targeted ads on social media. No recruitment was conducted via The Trevor Project’s website or social media channels. Respondents were defined as being LGBTQ if they identified with a sexual orientation other than straight/heterosexual, a gender identity other than cisgender, or both. In order to ensure the representativeness of the sample, targeted recruitment was conducted to ensure adequate sample sizes with respect to geography, gender identity, and race/ethnicity. Qualified respondents completed a secure online questionnaire that included a maximum of 158 questions. Questions on considering and attempting suicide in the past year were taken from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey to allow for comparisons to their nationally representative sample. Each question related to mental health and suicide was preceded by a message stating, “If at any time you need to talk to someone about your mental health or thoughts of suicide, please call The Trevor Project at 1-866-488-7386.” Although 98,023 individuals from unique IP addresses began the survey, 1,784 were ineligible due to sampling inclusion requirement, 35,830 did not complete the initial demographic screening questions, and 25,201 were pathed out of the sample because they did not meet recruitment requirements based on the demographic screening questions. This resulted in an eligible sample of 35,208 LGBTQ young people ages 13 to 24. Of those young people, a total of 1,495 (4%) failed the study’s validity check, indicated that they weren’t honest in their responses, and/or were identified as mischievous based on written responses. Additionally, 5,189 (15%) young people did not reach the mid-point of the survey, which included our questions on suicidal thoughts and attempts. This results in a final analytic sample of 28,524 LGBTQ young people ages 13 to 24 who resided in the United States. Chi-square tests were used to examine differences between groups. All reported comparisons are statistically significant at least at p<0.05. This means there is less than a 5% likelihood these results occurred by chance. This report uses “transgender and nonbinary” as an umbrella term to encompass non-cisgender young people, which includes young people who identify as transgender and nonbinary as well as other labels outside of the cisgender binary, including genderqueer, agender, genderfluid, gender neutral, bigender, androgynous, and gender non-conforming, among others. Comparability In order to better understand how our sample compares to a national probabilistic sample, we included questions regarding considering and attempting suicide that were identical to those used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in their Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). Analyses were conducted to compare rates of seriously considering suicide and attempting suicide in the past 12 months among young people ages 13 to 18 in our sample to the 2021 YRBS sample of high school students who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, questioning, or another non-heterosexual identity (LGBQ+). YRBS prevalence rates among LGBQ+ young people for seriously considering suicide (45%) were identical to rates among the same age range in our sample of LGBTQ young people (45%). Additionally, 22% of LGBQ+ young people in the 2021 YRBS reported a suicide attempt in the past 12 months compared to 16% in our sample of LGBTQ young people ages 13 to 18.

Accepting Adults Reduce Suicide Attempts Among LGBTQ Youth [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.thetrevorproject.org/research-briefs/accepting-adults-reduce-suicide-attempts-among-lgbtq-youth/)

> Youth's Lives Every Day Summary The Center for Disease Control and Preventionâs Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey (YRBS) highlights high rates of adverse mental health indicators among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) students, including increased depressive symptoms, increased rates of seriously considering suicide, and increased rates of attempted suicide (Johns et al., 2019; Kann et al., 2018). According to the minority stress model, mental health disparities among LGBTQ youth result from increased experiences of discrimination and rejection from others (Meyers, 2003). It is hypothesized that increased support from others can serve as a protective factor, decreasing the risk for negative mental health outcomes among LGBTQ youth. Previous research has found a link between support from others and reduced suicide attempts among lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth (Goodenow et al., 2006). However, that research was conducted with a sample of approximately 200 youth and focused solely on the role of support from adults at school on youth who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. This brief draws from The Trevor Projectâs National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health (The Trevor Project, 2019) to examine the impact of acceptance from multiple types of adults on reducing suicide attempts among LGBTQ youth. Using data from thousands of respondents, this research shows that youth with at least one accepting adult were significantly less likely to report a suicide attempt. Results LGBTQ youth who report having at least one accepting adult were 40% less likely to report a suicide attempt in the past year. Nearly 80% of youth who completed The Trevor Projectâs National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health reported disclosing their sexual orientation to at least one adult. Among those who disclosed to at least one adult, 79% had at least one adult who was accepting of them. Over one-quarter of LGBTQ youth who did not have at least one accepting adult in their life reported attempting suicide in the past year compared to 17% of those with at least one accepting adult. The positive impact of acceptance from at least one adult on past year suicide attempt was statistically significant (OR=.60, p<.001). Importantly, this analysis also controlled for the effects of race/ethnicity, age, and gender identity on suicide attempts in the past year. Methodology A quantitative cross-sectional design was used to collect data through an online survey platform between February and September 2018. A sample of LGBTQ youth ages 13â24 who resided in the United States were recruited via targeted ads on social media. A total of 34,808 youth consented to complete The Trevor Projectâs 2019 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health with a final analytic sample of 25,896. The current analyses focused on the 20,202 youth who reported disclosing their sexual orientation to at least one adult. Youth were first asked whether they had disclosed their sexual orientation to any of the following adults: parent, family member other than a parent or sibling, teacher or guidance counselor, and doctor or other healthcare provider. As a follow-up, youth were asked to what extent they were accepted by the adult(s) to whom they disclosed their sexual orientation. A variable was created that indicated whether youth felt accepted by one or more of the adults to whom they disclosed or did not feel accepted by any adult(s) to whom they disclosed. Past year suicide attempt was assessed with the question âDuring the past 12 months, did you actually attempt suicide?,â which was asked of youth who reported having seriously considered suicide in the past 12 months. A logistic regression model was utilized to predict past year suicide attempt based on the presence of an accepting adult while controlling for the impact of youth age, gender identity, and race/ethnicity. Looking Ahead Increased minority stress, often in the form of rejection and discrimination, is thought to be the primary reason for the adverse mental health outcomes observed among LGBTQ youth (Meyers, 2003). While research about LGBTQ youth has examined the impact of accepting parents, this study shows that any accepting adult can reduce the risk of suicide attempts for LGBTQ youth. Although some adults may be reluctant to reach out to youth, these findings suggest that youth would benefit considerably from increased acceptance from adults. Future research should continue to explore the ways adults can take proactive steps to positively impact the lives of LGBTQ youth. At The Trevor Project, our crisis services team works 24/7 to be a supportive and accepting adult for LGBTQ youth in crisis. We also provide trainings for adults, including professionals who work with youth. These trainings help counselors, educators, school nurses, social workers, and other adults understand the diverse and unique needs of LGBTQ youth and discuss LGBTQ-competent suicide prevention so they might be able to serve in a life-saving capacity for youth.

Estimate of How Often LGBTQ Youth Attempt Suicide in the U.S. [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.thetrevorproject.org/research-briefs/estimate-of-how-often-lgbtq-youth-attempt-suicide-in-the-u-s/)

> Youth's Lives Every Day Summary Suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020), with LGBTQ youth being four times more likely to seriously consider suicide, to make a plan for suicide, and to attempt suicide than their peers (Johns et al., 2019; Johns et al., 2020). Understanding the number of LGBTQ youth who seriously consider and attempt suicide, as well as how often suicide risk occurs, improves our ability to serve and advocate for LGBTQ youth. Finding The Trevor Project estimates that at least one LGBTQ youth between the ages of 13–24 attempts suicide every 45 seconds in the U.S. Because many LGBTQ youth report attempting suicide multiple times in a given year, this estimate likely underrepresents the extent of how often LGBTQ youth attempt suicide in the U.S. Additionally, The Trevor Project’s past-year attempted suicide rates are based on non-probability data that trend slightly slower than rates among national probability datasets Methodology A. Estimating the Number of LGBTQ Youth Ages of 13–24 in the U.S. This estimate is based on Trevor’s previous estimates of the total number of LGBTQ youth between ages 13–24 who live in the U.S. each year. The process for deriving these numbers can be found in The Trevor Project’s National Estimate of LGBTQ Youth Seriously Considering Suicide. Based on our previous estimation process, there are approximately 2,647,755 LGBTQ youth living in the United States who are between the ages of 13–18 and approximately 2,529,117 who are between the ages of 19–24. B. Estimating the Number of LGBTQ Youth Who Attempted Suicide in the Past Year The Trevor Project’s 2021 National Survey of LGBTQ Youth Mental Health found that 19.0% of LGBTQ youth ages 13–18 and 8.3% of LGBTQ youth ages 19–24 reported attempting suicide in the past year. Applying these rates to the estimates of LGBTQ youth living in the U.S. results in an estimated 503,073 LGBTQ youth between the ages of 13–18 and 209,917 between the ages of 19–24 who attempted suicide in the past year, for a total of 712,990 LGBTQ youth between the ages of 13–24. C. Estimating How Often LGBTQ Youth Attempt Suicide in the U.S. To approximate how often attempts occur, the estimated total number of LGBTQ youth ages 13–24 who attempted suicide (712,990) was divided by the total number of minutes in a year (525,600), resulting in an estimated 1.356525992 attempts each minute or .02260876654 per second. Dividing the number 1 by the estimate per second, provides an estimate of how often an attempt occurs in seconds, which was 44.23063055. As such, we estimate that at least one LGBTQ youth between the ages of 13–24 attempts suicide in the U.S. every 45 seconds. ReferencesCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. (2020).

MMWR Suppl, 69,(Suppl-1):19–27.| Estimation CaveatsThis estimation does not account for the fact that many LGBTQ youth report multiple suicide attempts each year. Further suicide attempts are not distributed across time in an even and consistent pattern. Thus, this estimate only serves as an approximation of how often LGBTQ youth attempt suicide. Although the data on frequency of suicide attempts is based on our National Survey (which is not a probability survey), our findings are similar to other reputable sources such as the CDC’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey.| © The Trevor Project 2021

Facts About Suicide Among LGBTQ+ Young People [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.thetrevorproject.org/resources/article/facts-about-lgbtq-youth-suicide/)

> Youth's Lives Every Day Last Updated January 2024 Top-Line Facts & Statistics - Suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people aged 10 to 14, and the third leading cause of death among 15-24 year olds (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022). Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ+) young people are at significantly increased risk. - LGBTQ+ young people are more than four times as likely to attempt suicide than their peers (Johns et al., 2019; Johns et al., 2020). - The Trevor Project estimates that more than 1.8 million LGBTQ+ young people (ages 13-24) seriously consider suicide each year in the U.S. — and at least one attempts suicide every 45 seconds. - The Trevor Project’s 2023 U.S. National Survey on the Mental Health of LGBTQ Young People found that 41% of LGBTQ+ young people seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year, including roughly half of transgender and nonbinary youth. The Importance of Intersectionality - Intersectionality is a framework for understanding how interdependent and multidimensional social identities at the individual level, such as race/ethnicity, gender, and sexuality, are shaped by interlocking systems of privilege and oppression at the societal level, such as heterosexism, cisgenderism, and racism (Crenshaw, 1991). - This intersection of identities may, in turn, present distinct stressors for some LGBTQ+ young people compared to others, and minority stress may be most persistent and problematic for youth who occupy multiple marginalized social positions (Cyrus, 2017). - That said, largely due to sample size limitations, researchers often fail to examine within-group differences among LGBTQ+ young people, limiting our understanding of within-group disparities in suicidal thoughts and behaviors. - However, existing research points to increased disparities for bisexual youth, transgender and nonbinary youth, and LGBTQ+ youth of color. Mental Health Disparities Across Social Identities - Bisexual Youth Mental Health Facts - Data show that bisexual youth, or those who have the capacity to form attraction and/or relationships to more than one gender, report higher rates of depressed mood, bullying, sexual assault, and physical harm - According to The Trevor Project’s analysis of CDC data, almost half (48%) of bi young people seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year, and 27% attempted suicide. Among gay or lesbian youth, 37% seriously considered suicide and 19% attempted. And among straight youth, 14% seriously considered suicide and 6% attempted suicide. - These suicide risk disparities among bi youth also remain constant across gender identity and race/ethnicity. - Transgender and Nonbinary Young People Mental Health Facts - Transgender and nonbinary young people face elevated risk for depression, thoughts of suicide, and attempting suicide compared to those who are cisgender and straight, including cisgender members of the LGBTQ+ community. - A 2020 peer-reviewed study by The Trevor Project’s researchers, published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, found that transgender and nonbinary youth were 2 to 2.5 times as likely to experience depressive symptoms, seriously consider suicide, and attempt suicide compared to their cisgender LGBQ peers. - LGBTQ+ Young People of Color Mental Health Facts - The Trevor Project’s 2023 national survey found that nearly all LGBTQ+ young people of color reported higher rates of attempting suicide than their white peers in the past year. Among the more than 28,000 LGBTQ+ young people surveyed, 11% of white youth attempted suicide compared to 22% of Native/Indigenous youth, 18% of Middle Eastern/Northern African youth, 16% of Black youth, 17% of multiracial youth, 15% of Latinx youth, and 10% of Asian/Pacific Islander youth. - Across race/ethnicity, Native/Indigenous youth who are Two-Spirit/LGBTQ+ consistently report the highest suicide risk. - Nearly a quarter of Indigenous LGBTQ+ young people (23%) reported attempting suicide in the past year, compared to 14% among the overall sample of LGBTQ+ young people. - In particular, Black transgender and nonbinary young people report disproportionate rates of suicide risk — with 58% seriously considering suicide and 1 in 4 (25%) attempting suicide in the past year. - These disparities highlight the devastating impacts of historical and ongoing oppression and trauma inflicted on Black, Indigenous, and people of color. Some Key Risk Factors for Suicide among LGBTQ+ Young People - Minority Stress - The Minority Stress Model, one of the most predominant theories used to explain mental health disparities experienced by LGBTQ+ individuals, suggests that experiences of LGBTQ+-based victimization — and the internalization of these experiences and anti-LGBTQ+ messages — can compound and produce negative mental health outcomes and increase suicide risk among LGBTQ+ individuals (Meyer, 2003). - A 2021 peer-reviewed study by The Trevor Project’s researchers, published in the American Journal of Community Psychology, found that greater experiences of minority stress experiences are associated with increased odds of attempting suicide. LGBTQ+ young people who reported experiencing four types of minority stress — LGBTQ+-based physical harm, discrimination, housing instability, and change attempts by parents — were 12 times at greater odds of attempting suicide compared to youth who experienced none. - Rejection and a Lack of Social Support & Affirming Spaces - Research suggests that among LGBTQ+ young people, only one-third experience parental acceptance, with an additional one-third experiencing parental rejection, and the final one-third not disclosing their LGBTQ+ identity until they are adults (Katz-Wise et al., 2015). Another study found that LGB young adults who report high levels of parental rejection are eight times more likely to report attempting suicide and six times more likely to report high levels of depression (Ryan et al., 2009). - Many LGBTQ+ young people lack access to affirming spaces, with only 38% of LGBTQ+ youth reporting that their home is LGBTQ+-affirming and just over half saying that their school is LGBTQ+-affirming. Just over 1 in 3 transgender and nonbinary youth found their home to be gender-affirming, and 52% found their school to be affirming. The Trevor Project’s research consistently finds that LGBTQ+ young people report lower rates of attempting suicide when they have access to LGBTQ+-affirming spaces. - Physical Harm & Bullying Facts - 24% of LGBTQ+ young people reported that they have been physically threatened or harmed, and those who did attempted suicide at nearly triple the rate of those who did not in the past year. - The Trevor Project’s research has also found that 52% of LGBTQ+ youth who were enrolled in middle or high school reported being bullied either in person or electronically in the past year, and those who were bullied had three times greater odds of attempting suicide in the past year. - Discrimination Facts - 60% of LGBTQ+ young people report that they had experienced discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity at least once in their lifetime, and those who did attempted suicide at more than twice the rate of those who did not in the past year. - A 2020 peer-reviewed study by The Trevor Project’s researchers, published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, found that transgender and nonbinary youth who report experiencing discrimination based on their gender identity had more than double the odds of attempting suicide in the past year compared to those who did not experience discrimination based on their gender identity. - Conversion Therapy Facts - A 2020 peer-reviewed study by The Trevor Project’s researchers, published in the American Journal of Public Health, found that young people who reported undergoing conversion therapy were more than twice as likely to report having attempted suicide and more than 2.5 times as likely to report multiple suicide attempts in the past year. - According to The Trevor Project’s 2023 national survey, 15% of LGBTQ+ young people reported being threatened with or subjected to conversion therapy, including nearly 1 in 5 transgender and nonbinary young people Some Key Protective Factors for Suicide among LGBTQ+ Young People - The Impact of Social Support and Acceptance from Adults and Peers - LGBTQ+ young people with at least one accepting adult in their life report significantly lower rates of attempting suicide. - A 2021 peer-reviewed study by The Trevor Project’s researchers, published in Transgender Health, found that transgender and nonbinary youth who reported gender identity acceptance from adults and peers had significantly lower odds of attempting suicide in the past year. - LGBTQ+ young people who felt high social support from their family reported attempting suicide at less than half the rate of those who felt low or moderate social support. - LGBTQ+ young people who live in a community that is accepting of LGBTQ+ people reported much lower rates of attempting suicide than those who do not. - The Impact of Affirming Spaces and Activities, Especially at School - The Trevor Project’s research has found that LGBTQ+ young people who found their school and home to be LGBTQ+-affirming reported lower rates of attempting suicide. - LGBTQ+ young people who report the presence of trusted adults in their school have higher levels of self-esteem (Dessel et al., 2017) and access to supportive peers is protective against anxiety and depression, including among those who lack support from their family (Parra et al., 2018). - Schools also offer young people the ability to participate in extracurricular activities and clubs, which have been found to promote positive youth development (Eccles et al., 2003). The presence of Gender and Sexualities Alliances (GSAs) has been found to significantly reduce the risk for depression and increase well-being among LGBTQ+ young people and young adults (Toomey et al., 2011). - The Impact of Policies and Practices that Support Transgender and Nonbinary Youth - Transgender and nonbinary young people attempt suicide less when their pronouns are respected, when they are allowed to officially change the gender marker on their legal documents, and when they have access to spaces (online, at school, and home) that affirm their gender identity. - Transgender and nonbinary young people who reported having pronouns respected by all or most people in their lives attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected. - A 2022 peer-reviewed study by The Trevor Project researchers, published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, found that transgender and nonbinary young people who had changed their legal documents reported significantly lower rates of attempting suicide in the past year compared to those who had not. - Gender-affirming medical care, such as hormone therapy, is associated with positive mental health outcomes including showing promise for reducing suicide risk. A 2021 peer-reviewed study by The Trevor Project’s researchers, published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, found that gender-affirming hormone therapy is significantly related to lower rates of depression, suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempts among transgender and nonbinary young people.

Homelessness and Housing Instability Among LGBTQ Youth [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.thetrevorproject.org/research-briefs/homelessness-and-housing-instability-among-lgbtq-youth-feb-2022/)

> Youth's Lives Every Day Executive Summary LGBTQ youth are overrepresented among young people experiencing homelessness and housing instability in the United States. This elevated risk of homelessness and housing instability has detrimental effects on LGBTQ youths’ mental health. This report uses data from the 2021 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health to examine the prevalence of homelessness and various manifestations of housing instability among LGBTQ youth and their mental health symptoms. It also examines rates of homelessness and housing instability among various subgroups within the LGBTQ community and the prevalence of experiences which are frequently connected to housing instability (e.g., food insecurity). Finally, it includes recommendations for preventing and combating LGBTQ youth homelessness. Key Findings Overall, 28% of LGBTQ youth reported experiencing homelessness or housing instability at some point in their lives. Nearly half (44%) of Native/Indigenous LGBTQ youth have experienced homelessness or housing instability at some point in their life, compared to 16% of Asian American/Pacific Islander youth, 27% of White LGBTQ youth, 27% of Latinx LGBTQ youth, 26% of Black LGBTQ youth, and 36% of multiracial LGBTQ youth. - Homelessness and housing instability were reported at higher rates among transgender and nonbinary youth, including 38% of transgender girls/women, 39% of transgender boys/men, and 35% of nonbinary youth, compared to 23% of cisgender LGBQ youth. - 16% of LGBTQ youth reported that they had slept away from parents or caregivers because they ran away from home, with more than half (55%) reporting that they ran away from home because of mistreatment or fear of mistreatment due to their LGBTQ identity. - 14% of LGBTQ youth reported that they had slept away from parents or caregivers because they were kicked out or abandoned, with 40% reporting that they were kicked out or abandoned due to their LGBTQ identity. - LGBTQ youth who experienced homelessness or housing instability reported higher rates of mental health challenges, compared to their stably housed LGBTQ peers. LGBTQ youth in our sample who reported housing instability or homelessness had nearly two to four times the odds of reporting depression (aOR = 2.07), anxiety (aOR = 1.96), self-harm (aOR = 2.30), considering suicide (aOR = 2.62), and attempting suicide (aOR = 3.70) compared to those who did not report any housing instability. - 69% of youth who reported past housing instability and 68% of youth who were currently homeless reported that they had engaged in self-harm in the last year – compared to 49% of youth who had not experienced housing instability, - 58% of youth who reported past housing instability and 62% of youth who were currently homeless reported having seriously considered suicide in the last year – compared to 35% of youth who had not experienced housing instability, - 28% of youth who reported past housing instability and 35% of youth who were currently homeless reported a suicide attempt in the last year – compared to 10% of youth who had not experienced housing instability, - LGBTQ youth who reported experiencing homelessness or housing instability had higher rates of victimization, being in foster care, and food insecurity, compared to their stably housed LGBTQ peers LGBTQ youth who reported past housing instability or current homelessness had more than three times greater odds (aOR = 3.46) of ever being physically threatened or abused due to their sexual orientation or, among transgender and nonbinary identity, gender identity (aOR = 3.13). - LGBTQ youth who reported past housing instability or current homelessness had nearly six times greater odds (aOR = 5.81) of reporting that they had been in foster care at any point in their life. - LGBTQ youth who reported past housing instability or current homelessness had more than three times greater odds (aOR = 3.53) of reporting food insecurity in the last month. - Recommendation Summary Preventing LGBTQ Youth Homelessness. Strong anti-discrimination policies in the workplace and strong anti-bully and harassment policies in schools can be effective in helping LGBTQ youth stay connected to school and employment, increasing their skills and future earnings, and making it easier for them to maintain stable housing. Additionally, since family conflict around youths’ LGBTQ identities is a driving factor in LGBTQ youth homelessness, developing family counseling or mediation programs may be effective at decreasing conflict and keeping LGBTQ youth in their homes and connected to their families. Special attention should also be paid to preventing housing instability among LGBTQ youth in foster care through case management and exit planning for youth exiting care. - Increased Funding for Low-Barrier Housing Programs. More funding should be allocated for safe, low-barrier housing programs which can have an immediate positive impact on LGBTQ youth experiencing housing instability. - Reimagining Shelter Services. One immediate action that housing providers can take to support LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness is to make sure that all shelter and housing facilities provide culturally competent services to LGBTQ youth. - Improved Data Collection on LGBTQ Youth Homelessness. Better data is needed to understand the full scope and impact of LGBTQ youth homelessness in the United States. Questions about both LGBTQ identity and housing status should be added to population surveys of youth and young adults, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). - Anti-Poverty Economic Policies. LGBTQ youth are impacted by their families’ and communities’ economic stability. Policies that combat poverty at the societal level will have a positive impact on LGBTQ youths’ access to safe and secure housing. Economic upheavals, such as what we are seeing with the COVID-19 pandemic, increase economic pressure on low-income households and make it even more urgent for legislators to tackle root causes of poverty in the United States to the benefit of LGBTQ youth, their families, and their communities. - Background LGBTQ youth are overrepresented among young people experiencing homelessness (Choi, Wilson, Shelton, & Gates, 2015; Durso & Gates, 2012; Morton, et al., 2018; Baams et al., 2019). While the challenges of identifying and contacting youth experiencing homelessness make it difficult to establish the exact prevalence of LGBTQ youth homelessness, it is estimated that lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth make up 7-9% of the general population (Wilson, Cooper, Kastanis, & Nezhad, 2014) but 29% of youth experiencing homelessness (Choi et al., 2015). Studies show that nearly one in four (23%) of transgender young adults between the ages of 18 and 25 experience homelessness, Further, a study by the Williams Institute found that 23% of transgender young adults between the ages of 18 and 25 reported ever experiencing homelessness, compared to 12.5% of the overall population of 18-25 year-olds (O’Neill, Wilson, & Herman, 2020; Morton et al., 2018). This report is intentionally using the phrase “homelessness and housing instability” to capture the wide variety of experiences that can negatively impact a young person’s housing stability. The state of not having a permanent home is a complicated and non-linear experience that can be difficult to capture and measure in survey research. Homelessness and housing instability include a variety of circumstances: living on the streets, staying in emergency shelters or transitional housing, living in one’s car, staying at a hotel due to lack of other housing options, sleeping in a public place or on public transportation, or temporarily moving in with friends and family. Over the course of days or weeks, a young person may sleep on the bus, move in with a friend, stay in an emergency shelter, and then move in with an extended family member. This frequently unplanned movement makes it difficult for researchers and practitioners to connect with youth experiencing homelessness or housing instability, whether to conduct research or offer services. Each of these housing circumstances also comes with unique risks. Couch-surfing with friends is generally considered to be safer than sleeping on the streets; however, youth staying with friends, extended family, and acquaintances are still vulnerable to theft, exploitation, and violence. The volatility of housing instability also makes it difficult for young people to stay connected to supportive institutions such as school, employment, or case management. Risks Associated with LGBTQ Youth Homelessness Experiencing homelessness or housing instability is associated with a number of safety risks for LGBTQ youth. For example, with the exception of marijuana use, LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness are more likely to report drug use compared to their straight, cisgender peers experiencing homelessness (Gattis, 2013; Kattari, Barman-Adhikari, DeChants, & Rice, 2017; Saewyc et al., 2017). This substance use increases LGBTQ youths’ risk of violence. For example, LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness report higher incidences of being injured or having sex when they did not want to because of substance use (Saewyc et al., 2017). LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness are more likely to report engaging in survival sex, defined as exchanging sex for money, a place to stay, or to fulfill other basic needs (Bauermeister, Eaton, Meanley, Pingel, & UHIP Partnership, 2017; Ecker, 2016; Gattis, 2013; Tyler, 2013). LGB youth experiencing homelessness are more likely to report a variety of risky sexual behaviors, including having unprotected anal sex and having sex with a sex worker, an intravenous drug user, or a person living with HIV (Ecker, 2016; Gattis, 2013; Rice et al., 2013). LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness are also more likely to have been either physically or sexually assaulted or abused (Gattis, 2013; Ecker, 2016; Saewyc et al., 2017). 1 It is important to note that due to a failure to collect nuanced sexual orientation and gender identity data in many large-scale surveys, much of the previous research on LGBTQ youth actually only covers those who are lesbian, gay, or bisexual. In this report, findings that only apply to lesbian, gay, or bisexual youth will be denoted with the acronym LGB and findings which apply to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning youth will be denoted with acronym LGBTQ. Homelessness or housing instability can have strong negative impacts on LGBTQ youths’ mental health, even when compared to their unhoused straight, cisgender peers or housed LGBTQ youth. LGB youth experiencing homelessness report higher rates of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), self-harm, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts than their straight, cisgender peers experiencing homelessness (Ecker, 2016; Gattis & Larson, 2017; Gattis, 2013; Moskowitz et al., 2012; Saewyc et al, 2017). LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness are also more likely to report high levels of stress compared to their straight, cisgender peers experiencing homelessness (Moskowitz et al., 2012). Previous research from The Trevor Project shows that LGBTQ youth who had experienced housing instability reported attempting suicide at more than three times the rate of their LGBTQ peers who had not experienced housing instability (The Trevor Project, 2019). Complexities of Measuring Housing Status Among LGBTQ Youth This complexity also extends to data about LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness. Few large data sets that include youth experiences of homelessness exist due to the difficulty of finding and recruiting youth experiencing homelessness into study participation. The CDC’s Youth Risk and Behavior Survey (YRBS) measures health behaviors and outcomes among youth in middle and high school across the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). Since 2015, a question on sexual orientation was added to the standard YRBS questionnaire for high school students, and states and local jurisdictions had the discretion to add questions about homelessness as well as transgender identity. However, only 27 states ask questions about housing and sexual orientation and very few ask about gender identity in ways that include transgender students. This creates a lack of data about the combined experiences of homelessness and LGBTQ identity. The California Healthy Kids Survey is one iteration of the YRBS which includes questions about both housing status and LGBTQ identity. While this data is important, it only examines LGBTQ identity as an aggregate group, and there is no option to examine for within-group differences among the many identities which make up the LGBTQ community. Advocates in the LGBTQ community have worked for decades to address this overrepresentation and to increase LGBTQ youths’ access to safe and secure housing. In particular, True Colors United has done powerful and impactful work to raise awareness, advocate for policy change, and elevate the voices of LGBTQ young people experiencing homelessness. This report seeks to build upon this important work by sharing insights on LGBTQ youth who have experienced homelessness or housing instability based on data from The Trevor Project’s 2021 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health. Additionally, most studies specifically on LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness recruit small samples of participants from housing services and therefore do not include housed LGBTQ youth for comparison. The data in this report are unique in that they include both housed and unhoused LGBTQ youth for comparison. Furthermore, the sample size also includes youths’ specific LGBTQ identities and therefore allows us to look at differences among subgroups (e.g. bisexual youth, transgender youth). Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Housing It is important to note that the data in this report were collected between October and December 2020 and were therefore influenced by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic upheavals. Data from our 2021 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health show that more than 80% of LGBTQ youth reported that COVID-19 had made their living situation more stressful, indicating that the pandemic has had an impact on LGBTQ youths’ access to safe and secure housing. The economic disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic has threatened the housing stability of thousands of Americans. A recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that over 2 million homeowners and 8 million renters were behind on their mortgage or rent payments (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 2021). They further report that Black and Hispanic households were more than twice as likely to report being behind on housing payments, highlighting the disproportionate risk faced by households of color (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 2021). While the long-term economic impacts of the pandemic cannot yet be observed, a study on the mental health impacts of the Great Recession found that housing instability accounted for a significant amount of the accelerated suicide deaths in the US during that time(Fowler et al., 2015). Economic stress impacts LGBTQ youth homelessness in two central ways. Firstly, LGBTQ youth are at risk of homelessness if their families lose their housing. History of family homelessness increases young people’s individual risk of homelessness or housing instability (Samuels et al., 2019). LGBTQ youth of color are at particular risk of family homelessness due to the COVID-19 pandemic, given that Black and Hispanic households are more likely to be behind on housing payments due to pandemic-related economic disruptions (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 2021). Secondly, LGBTQ youth already living away from their families are also vulnerable to the economic upheaval of the pandemic. Job losses due to the pandemic were concentrated among low-paid industries, eliminating many of the entry-level jobs that young adults rely on to start their careers and maintain stable housing (Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, 2021). Decreased access to jobs that pay a living wage may place LGBTQ youth at increased risk of homelessness. As the nation’s largest provider of crisis services for LGBTQ youth, the Trevor Project is dedicated to understanding how homelessness and housing instability impact the well-being and safety of LGBTQ young people. This report examines experiences of homelessness and housing instability among respondents to our 2021 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health and their impact on LGBTQ youths’ mental health. Notably, our large and diverse sample allows us to explore experiences across age, sexual orientation, gender identity, and race/ethnicity. Methods Sample and Procedures Data were collected from an online survey platform between October and December 2020. LGBTQ youth between the ages of 13 and 24 were recruited via targeted ads on social media. The final analytical sample included 34,759 LGBTQ youth from across the United States. The overall survey included a maximum of 142 questions. Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were used to examine differences in groups and to determine the adjusted odds of mental health indicators. Adjusted odds ratios predicting mental health indicators controlled for sex assigned at birth, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, and Census Region. Measures of Housing Instability Survey respondents were asked a number of questions about their current and previous housing. The question about current housing asked, “What best describes where you currently live?” and provided twelve response options including, “a shelter, car, campground, or other transitional or temporary housing.” Respondents were also asked, “Are you currently or have you ever been homeless (even if only for a short period of time)?” with response options including: 1) No, 2) Yes, I have been in the past but am currently not, or 3) Yes, I am currently homeless. To assess housing instability due to running away or being abandoned, respondents were asked, “Have you ever had to sleep away from your parent(s) or caregiver(s) because you were kicked out or were abandoned?” and “Have you ever slept away from your parent(s) or caregiver(s) because you ran away?”, both with response options of 1) No and 2) Yes. From four questions, three groups were created to examine housing instability and homelessness among LGBTQ youth. Respondents who reported that they were currently homeless or currently living in a shelter, car, campground, or other transitional or temporary housing were grouped together as Currently Homeless (n = 219). Respondents who reported that they had either been homeless in the past, had run away, or had been kicked out or been abandoned at any point were grouped together as Past Housing Instability (n = 9,666). And finally, respondents who reported none of these experiences were grouped together as Neither Past Nor Current Housing Instability (n = 24,874). Measures of Mental Health and Suicide Risk Other outcomes related to homelessness and housing instability were measured using a variety of survey items. Current symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder were measured using the GAD-2 (Plummer et al., 2016). Currently, major depressive disorder symptoms were measured using the PHQ-2 (Richardson et al., 2010). Questions on self-harm, considering suicide, and attempting suicide in the past 12 months were taken from the CDC’s YRBS (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). Measures of Factors Associated with Homelessness and Housing Instability Barriers to mental health care were measured by asking, “In the past 12 months, have you wanted psychological or emotional counseling from a mental health professional?” Response options included 1) No, 2) Yes, but I didn’t get it, 3) Yes, and I got it. Experiences of victimization due to youths’ LGBTQ identity were measured by asking, “Have you ever felt physically threatened or been physically abused because of your sexual orientation?”, “In the past 12 months, have you felt physically threatened or been physically abused because of your sexual orientation?”, “Have you ever felt physically threatened or been physically abused because of your gender identity?”, and “In the past 12 months, have you felt physically threatened or been physically abused because of your gender identity?” Response options included 1) No, and 2) Yes. To ensure accuracy, questions about victimization due to gender identity were only examined among respondents who identified as transgender, nonbinary, or questioning their gender identity. Youth’s experiences with the foster care system were measured by asking, “Have you ever been in foster care (even if only for a short period of time)?” Response options included: 1) No, and 2) Yes. Experiences of food insecurity were measured by asking, “During the last month, did you worry that food at home would run out before you or your family got money to buy more?” and “During the last month, were you hungry but didn’t eat because you or your family didn’t have enough food?” Response options included: 1) Never, 2) Sometimes, and 3) A lot. A new dichotomous variable was created, grouping respondents who answered Sometimes or A lot to either question, compared to respondents who answered Never for both questions. Findings Homelessness and Housing Instability Among LGBTQ Youth Youth respondents reported a wide variety of scenarios that could contribute to homelessness and housing instability. Over a quarter of respondents (28%) reported that they were currently homeless or had experienced homelessness or housing instability in the past. Two hundred and nineteen respondents (0.6%) reported that they were currently homeless. Of those who were currently homeless, 89 (41%) reported that they were living in a shelter, car, campground, or other transitional or temporary housing at the time of the survey. Twenty-eight percent of respondents reported having experienced housing instability in the past. Among those who had experienced housing instability, 5,259 (54%) reported that they had been homeless in the past, 4,573 (47%) reported that they had been kicked out, and 5,388 (56%) reported that they had run away or been abandoned. This indicates overlap among these three experiences, with a number of youth experiencing two or three of the circumstances (e.g., both kicked out and run away). Family conflict about youths’ LGBTQ identities was a factor in this housing instability, with 40% of youth who said they had been kicked out and 55% of youth who said they had run away or been abandoned reporting that it had been due to mistreatment or fear of mistreatment related to their LGBTQ identity. Demographics of LGBTQ Youth Experiencing Homelessness and Housing Instability The demographic information for respondents in each of the groups is included in Table 1. These data show that while experiences of homelessness and housing instability impact LGBTQ young people from a variety of backgrounds and identities, LGBTQ youth of color, pansexual youth, and transgender and nonbinary youth, in particular, are placed at especially elevated risk of homelessness and housing instability. Race LGBTQ youth of color are overrepresented among LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness and housing instability. Compared to White LGBTQ youth, those who were Native/Indigenous had more than double the odds (aOR = 2.20) of experiencing housing instability or homelessness, with Black (aOR = 1.13), Latinx (aOR = 1.24) and multiracial LGBTQ (aOR = 1.58) youth also having significantly greater odds. Specifically, Native/Indigenous youth represented 1% of youth who had not experienced housing instability, but represented 3% of youth who reported past housing instability and 7% of youth who were currently homeless. Multiracial youth are similarly overrepresented, as they represented 16% of youth who had not experienced housing instability, 22% of youth who reported past housing instability, and 24% of youth who reported being currently homeless. Gender Identity Homelessness and housing instability were reported at higher rates among transgender and nonbinary youth. There were no significant differences in the odds of experiencing homelessness or housing instability between cisgender LGBQ boys/men and cisgender LGBQ girls/women. However, transgender girls/women (aOR = 1.93), transgender boys/men (aOR = 2.18), and nonbinary youth (aOR = 1.68) all had significantly greater odds of experiencing homelessness or housing instability compared to cisgender LGBQ boys/men. Transgender women and girls represent 2% of youth who had not experienced housing instability but 4% of youth who reported past housing instability and 6% of youth who reported being currently homeless. Transgender boys and men comprise 9% of youth who had not experienced housing instability but 14% of youth who reported past housing instability, and 17% of youth who reported being currently homeless. Nonbinary youth were also overrepresented among youth who reported past housing instability or current homelessness. Nonbinary youth represented 23% of youth who had not experienced housing instability but 32% of youth who reported past housing instability and 31% of youth who reported being currently homeless. Sexual Identity Fewer disparities were observed in the data about sexual identity, but pansexual youth were overrepresented in each group. Pansexual youth had nearly 50% greater odds (aOR = 1.46) compared to gay/lesbian youth. Pansexual youth made up 16% of youth who had not experienced housing instability but 24% of youth who reported past housing instability, 229% of youth who reported being currently homeless. Census Region Data about the census region where youth were located showed one significant disparity in the group of youth who reported being currently homeless. Compared to LGBTQ youth who lived in the Northeast region of the U.S., those who lived in the South (aOR = 1.21), Midwest (aOR = 1.18), and West (aOR = 1.22) all had significantly greater odds of experiencing homelessness or housing instability. Youth in the West made up 26% of youth who had not experienced housing instability but 36% of youth who reported being currently homeless. Mental Health and Suicide Risk among LGBTQ Youth Experiencing Homelessness and Housing Instability Data about mental health and suicide risk among LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness or housing instability can be found in Table 2. LGBTQ youth who reported past housing instability or current homelessness had greater odds of reporting anxiety, depression, self-harm, considering suicide, and attempting suicide. Anxiety, Depression, and Self-Harm LGBTQ youth who reported experiences of homelessness and housing instability reported high rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm. In adjusted logistic regression models, LGBTQ youth who reported housing instability or homelessness had nearly two times the odds of reporting depression (aOR = 2.07), anxiety (aOR = 1.96), and self-harm (aOR = 2.30). Compared to 68% of youth who had not experienced housing instability, 81% of youth who reported past housing instability and 84% of youth who reported being currently homeless reported symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. LGBTQ youth who reported housing instability also reported higher rates of depression. Fifty-eight percent of youth who had not experienced housing instability reported symptoms of depression, compared to 75% of youth who reported past housing instability and 82% of youth who reported being currently homeless. Rates of self-harm in the last year were very high among youth who reported past housing instability or current homelessness. Compared to 49% of youth who had not experienced housing instability, 69% of youth who reported past housing instability and 68% of youth who were currently homeless reported that they had engaged in self-harm in the last year. Seriously Considered or Attempted Suicide LGBTQ youth who reported experiences of homelessness and housing instability were also more likely to report seriously considering or attempting suicide in the past year. In adjusted logistic regression models, LGBTQ youth in our sample who reported housing instability or homelessness had two to three times the odds of considering suicide (aOR = 2.62, or attempting suicide (aOR = 3.70) compared to those who did not report any housing instability. Compared to 35% of youth who had not experienced housing instability, 58% of youth who reported past housing instability and 62% of youth who were currently homeless reported having seriously considered suicide in the last year. Among LGBTQ youth who reported housing instability, rates of attempting suicide in the past year were more than twice that of their peers who had not experienced housing instability. Ten percent of youth who had not experienced housing instability reported an attempt in the last year, compared to 28% of youth who reported past housing instability and 35% of youth who reported being currently homeless. Barriers to Mental Health Care Homelessness and housing instability can make it very difficult to access consistent, quality mental health care. Compared to 47% of youth who had not experienced housing instability, 51% of youth who reported past housing instability and 53%of youth who were currently homeless reported that they wanted mental health care but were unable to access it. Youth who reported past housing instability or current homelessness were more likely to report a number of structural barriers (cost, lack of transportation, lack of parental permission) and uncertainties about accessing mental health care (fears that a provider would only focus on their LGBTQ identity, previous negative experiences with mental health professionals, and fears that mental health treatment wouldn’t work) than their peers who had not reported housing instability. The majority (61%) of LGBTQ youth who reported housing instability or homelessness reported that they had not accessed mental health care because they could not afford it, compared to 39% of youth who had not experienced housing instability. One in three (33%) LGBTQ youth who reported housing instability or homelessness reported that they had not accessed mental health care because they could not get to the location, compared to one in five (20%) youth who had not experienced housing instability. One in four (25%) LGBTQ youth who reported housing instability or homelessness reported that they had not accessed mental health care because their parent/caregiver did not allow them to, compared to one in six (16%) LGBTQ youth who had not experienced housing instability. Fears about the process of accessing mental health care were also more prevalent among youth who reported housing instability or homelessness. More than one in five (22%) LGBTQ youth who reported housing instability or homelessness reported that they had not accessed mental health care because they thought the provider would only focus on their LGBTQ identity, compared to less than one in six (14%) LGBTQ youth who had not experienced housing instability. More than a quarter (27%) of LGBTQ youth who reported housing instability or homelessness reported that they had not accessed mental health care because they had a negative experience with a previous mental health professional and did not want to have another one, compared to 15% of youth who had not experienced housing instability. Finally, 42% of youth who reported housing instability or homelessness reported that they had not received mental health care because they were worried it wouldn’t work, compared to 37% of youth who had not experienced housing instability. Experiences Associated with Homelessness and Housing Instability Living on the streets or bouncing from shelter to couch-surfing can leave LGBTQ youth vulnerable to various forms of violence and victimization. Data about experiences frequently associated with homelessness or housing instability (victimization, history of foster care, and food insecurity) can be found in Table 3. Youth who reported past housing instability or current homelessness had greater odds of being threatened or abused due to their sexual orientation or gender identity, having a history of foster care, and having experienced food insecurity in the last month. Victimization Youth who reported experiencing homelessness or housing instability reported high rates of being threatened or abused due to their LGBTQ identity. LGBTQ youth who reported past housing instability or current homelessness had more than three times greater odds (aOR = 3.16) of being physically threatened or abused due to their sexual orientation in the last year compared to LGBTQ youth with no reported housing instability. Compared to 10% of youth who had not experienced housing instability, 26% of youth who reported past housing instability and 30% of youth who were currently homeless reported being threatened or abused due to their sexual identity in the last year. Transgender, nonbinary, or gender-questioning respondents also reported high rates of being threatened or abused due to their gender identity. Transgender and nonbinary youth who reported past housing instability or current homelessness had more than three times greater odds (aOR = 3.07)of being physically threatened or abused due to their gender identity in the last year compared to youth with no reported housing instability. Fourteen percent of transgender and nonbinary respondents who had never experienced housing instability reported being threatened or abused due to their gender identity in the last year, compared to 34% of transgender and nonbinary youth who reported past housing instability and 39% of transgender and nonbinary youth who were currently homeless. Foster Care Rates of a history of foster care were very high among LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness, especially among youth who reported current homelessness. LGBTQ youth who reported past housing instability or current homelessness had nearly six times greater odds (aOR = 5.81) of reporting that they had been in foster care at any point in their life, compared to LGBTQ youth who did not report any housing instability. While only 2% of youth who had not experienced housing instability reported having been in foster care, 10% of youth who reported past housing instability and 19% of youth who were currently homeless reported that they had been in foster care. Food Insecurity Experiences of food insecurity were high among LGBTQ youth who reported housing instability or homelessness. LGBTQ youth who reported past housing instability or current homelessness also had more than three times greater odds (aOR = 3.53) of reporting food insecurity in the last month, compared to their peers who did not report any housing instability. Compared to 22% of youth who had not experienced housing instability, 51% of youth who reported past housing instability and 72% of youth who were currently homeless reported that they had experienced food insecurity (worrying about food running out or not having enough to eat) in the last month. Recommendations Based on the data shared in this report and the perspectives of those in the field of housing advocacy, we offer the following recommendations for preventing and addressing LGBTQ youth homelessness. Preventing LGBTQ Youth Homelessness It is important to consider ways that LGBTQ youth homelessness can be prevented. Strong anti-discrimination policies in the workplace and strong anti-bullying and harassment policies in schools can be effective in helping LGBTQ youth stay connected to school and employment, increasing their skills and future earnings, and making it easier for them to maintain stable housing. Additionally, since family conflict around youths’ LGBTQ identities is a driving factor in LGBTQ youth homelessness, developing family counseling or mediation programs may be effective at decreasing conflict and keeping LGBTQ youth in their homes and connected to their families. Such programs should be mindful of youths’ safety as some families are not open to changing their ideas about LGBTQ people and are not safe to engage in counseling or mediation. However, research from the Family Acceptance Project shows that many parents reject their child’s LGBTQ identity because they fear the homophobia and transphobia their child may experience in society (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2014). Reaching out to these families to educate them about LGBTQ identities and the safe, fulfilling lives that their children can lead as openly LGBTQ people may help them become more understanding and accepting. Preserving connections with family networks can help LGBTQ youth maintain stable housing, as they can have more adults to rely on for emotional, logistical, and economic support. Specific attention should be paid to preventing housing instability among LGBTQ youth in foster care. Previous scholarship has established that youth exiting the foster care system are at elevated risk of homelessness (Dworsky et al., 2013), in part due to lack of a social and economic support network after they leave the child welfare system. LGBTQ youth are disproportionately more likely to be in foster care (Wilson et al., 2014) and therefore at greater risk of experiencing housing instability after exiting care. The findings in this report align with existing literature and show that LGBTQ youth who have been in foster care are indeed at elevated risk of homelessness and housing instability. This highlights the need for child welfare agencies to provide more structured housing support for young adults exiting care. Examples of such support include amending policies to allow youth to stay in care and receive services up to the age of 21 – which several states currently allow – and expanding programs like the Chaffee Grants, which offer economic assistance to youth exiting foster care. There is also a need for establishing LGBTQ-affirming foster homes within the child welfare system. Providing homes where LGBTQ youth feel affirmed and supported can help LGBTQ youth stay connected to the system longer (e.g., not run away from placements and experience housing instability) and build their social network of support as they transition out of foster care. Further, this speaks to the need for anti-discrimination protections for prospective LGBTQ parents, who may be more equipped to understand and care for the unique needs of LGBTQ youth. Increasing Funding for Low-Barrier Housing Programs Unlike other deeply entrenched social problems such as racism, homophobia, biphobia, or transphobia, homelessness has a concrete, evidence-based solution: housing. More funding should be allocated for safe, low-barrier housing programs which can have an immediate positive impact on LGBTQ youth experiencing housing instability. “Low barrier” refers to decreasing or eliminating the bureaucratic challenges that a young person must go through to access services. For example, removing age requirements that arbitrarily force young adults out of youth-focused services at age 21 would allow young people to stay in programs designed for their needs for longer, building relationships and stability with peers and staff. Another barrier is the requirement that housing clients must be sober to stay in a shelter or move into a transitional housing apartment. While substance use services should be available to all clients accessing housing services, it is unrealistic to expect youth to achieve and maintain sobriety before having access to safe and secure housing. A harm-reduction approach to substance use should be implemented in housing services to ensure client safety and support youth in reducing unhealthy substance use. Funding should also be increased for programs such as Section 8, which provides vouchers that can be used to subsidize clients’ rent. Section 8 vouchers are in high demand with long waitlists in many American metropolitan areas. Increasing the funding and availability of this program, as well as limiting bureaucratic barriers to accessing these vouchers and incentivizing landlords to accept them, would increase the effectiveness of this popular housing service. Reimagining Shelter Services One immediate action that housing providers can take to support LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness is to make sure that all shelter and housing facilities provide culturally competent services to LGBTQ youth. The high rates of victimization among youth who have experienced housing instability highlight LGBTQ youths’ vulnerability to violence and harassment when living on the streets, staying with friends or acquaintances, or even staying in a shelter. The Equal Access Rule is a regulation mandated by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development(HUD) which prohibits discrimination against LGBTQ people in HUD-funded shelter services and specifically requires that transgender individuals be allowed to use the dorm and bathroom facilities that align with their gender identity. While this rule provides strong regulatory protection, HUD is not well-equipped to enforce this rule at the many shelters and housing facilities that accept their funding each year, leaving transgender adults and youth experiencing homelessness vulnerable to discrimination and harassment. Stricter enforcement mechanisms would provide more robust protection for LGBTQ youth and, specifically, transgender youth who may be at highest risk when accessing shelter services. Additionally, shelter and housing facilities should provide LGBTQ cultural competency training to all staff to ensure that LGBTQ clients are treated with dignity and respect. Several advocates and organizations have argued that in order for LGBTQ people to truly be safe, the entire concept of congregate care settings (e.g., dorms that house multiple clients, usually divided by gender) needs to be reimagined or eliminated. Advocates argue that even the most culturally competent shelter does not provide adequate privacy, safety, and dignity to transgender and nonbinary residents. In fact, even at shelters where transgender residents are allowed to select the dorm they would like to stay in, there are few gender-neutral or third-gender dorms or bathrooms available for nonbinary residents. LGBTQ shelter residents are also vulnerable to discrimination and harassment from other shelter residents and it is nearly impossible for shelter staff to supervise and protect LGBTQ residents at all times. These concerns raise important questions about the safety and dignity of all residents (regardless of sexual or gender identity) in large congregate care settings. More research is needed to determine appropriate alternatives, such as individual rooms, or dorms organized by social connections rather than gender. The high rates of self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts among youth who are currently homeless and living in a shelter highlight the need for more robust connections between housing services and mental health care providers. Providing in-house mental health services at emergency shelters, offering transportation vouchers to young people to get to mental health appointments, and providing low-cost or free mental health care would decrease these barriers and allow more LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness to benefit from the mental health care that they want. Providers should also ensure that all mental health services that they offer or refer youth to are LGBTQ culturally competent to ensure that youth will feel comfortable using the services. Improving Data Collection on LGBTQ Youth Homelessness Better data is needed to understand the full scope and impact of LGBTQ youth homelessness in the United States. Questions about both LGBTQ identity and housing status should be added to population surveys of youth and young adults, such as the YRBS. Fortunately, starting in 2021, the CDC will add a question about homelessness to its standard YRBS questionnaire, improving nationwide data about homelessness and housing instability among students (School House Connection, 2020). However, questions about gender identity that can accurately capture transgender students and their experiences are still lacking in most YRBS jurisdictions. Because homelessness and housing instability create risky environments for young people, any survey seeking to measure the risks that youth encounter in adolescence and young adulthood should ask about respondents’ access to safe and secure housing. Similarly, LGBTQ identity should be measured with nuance so that homelessness and housing instability trends within the LGBTQ community can be observed and measured over time. For more information about measuring LGBTQ among youth in survey data, please refer to The Trevor Project’s previous report, “Measuring Youth Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity.” Additionally, current techniques used to identify and count individuals experiencing homelessness, such as the Point In Time Count (PITC) sponsored by the HUD each year, should be reassessed. Existing PITC protocols call for counting individuals in emergency shelters and street canvassing to count individuals living outdoors or in public spaces. These protocols, however, are likely to miss young people experiencing homelessness who are couch surfing or staying in informal, non-permanent housing arrangements. Adding questions about LGBTQ identity to PITC protocols would also allow for more accurate measuring of housing instability among LGBTQ youth and adults, although any questions about LGBTQ identity should be optional to protect participants’ privacy and safety. Collecting more accurate data about LGBTQ youth homelessness and housing instability will allow researchers, policymakers, and housing service providers to make more informed decisions about how to prevent and confront LGBTQ youth homelessness. Enacting Anti-Poverty Economic Policies LGBTQ youth homelessness does not exist in a vacuum. LGBTQ youth are impacted by their families’ and communities’ economic stability and policies that combat poverty at the societal level will have a positive impact on LGBTQ youths’ access to safe and secure housing. In the area of employment law, beneficial policies can include: requiring employers to pay a living wage, provide health insurance, and offer paid sick leave. Quality jobs with adequate pay and benefits allow people to maintain stable housing and promote better physical and mental health. Entry-level jobs that pay a living wage are particularly important for LGBTQ youth who are more likely to begin their careers without the support of their families. Local, state, and national authorities should also institute policies to increase the stock of affordable housing in their communities and subsidize the construction of new housing or renovation of existing housing properties. The economic upheaval of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased economic pressure on low-income households and made it even more urgent for legislators to tackle the root causes of poverty in the United States for the benefit of LGBTQ youth, their families, and their communities. Conclusion LGBTQ young people do not deserve to struggle with housing as they transition from children to young adults. These data indicate that Native/Indigenous, Multiracial, and Black youth are disproportionately at risk of homelessness and housing instability, likely due to the combined impacts of racism and LGBTQ stigma in housing, school, and the workplace. Solutions to housing instability, therefore, must account for intersectional barriers that LGBTQ youth encounter. The high rates of food insecurity among LGBTQ youth experiencing housing instability highlight the role of economic instability in homelessness and the importance of making sure that LGBTQ youth have access to nutrition programs such as free and reduced lunch at school. It is imperative that researchers and policymakers continue to examine this ongoing issue and implement strategies to get LGBTQ youth into safe and secure housing.

COVID-19 and LGBTQ Youth COVID-19 has serious implications for the mental health of LGBTQ youth. Although youth and young adults are estimated to have the lowest mortality rates from COVID-19 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020), they are not immune to its consequences, including as it relates to mental health and well-being. Even prior to the pandemic, LGBTQ youth have been found to be at significant increased risk for depression, anxiety, substance use, and suicidality (Russell & Fish, 2016). These risks are even more pronounced among youth who are transgender and/or nonbinary (Price-Feeney, Green, Dorison, 2020). Thus, LGBTQ youth may be particularly vulnerable to negative mental health impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This research report: (1) outlines ways that physical distancing, economic strain, and increased anxiety related to COVID-19 may impact LGBTQ youth; and (2) explains how The Trevor Project and others can work to support LGBTQ youth during this time. Although existing research points to concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on LGBTQ youth mental health and well-being, it also suggests ways these impacts can be minimized. Now more than ever, it is imperative that we increase LGBTQ youth access to a wide range of support and life-saving resources. The Trevor Project is committed to ensuring that LGBTQ youth are supported throughout this pandemic, and we hope others will join us working to protect the lives of LGBTQ youth. CONSEQUENCES OF PHYSICAL DISTANCING Physical distancing (commonly referred to as “social distancing”), the practice of avoiding close physical contact with others, is a crucial part of the public health approach to minimizing the impact of COVID-19 on the health of the U.S. population. However, physical distancing can impact LGBTQ youth by decreasing their access to positive social interactions and increasing negative social interactions. Decrease in Positive Social Interactions An unintended consequence of physical distancing is potential loss of the social connections that protect LGBTQ youth from suicidality. Social connections have been found to buffer stress, reduce depression, and improve well-being (Cohen, 2004). Durkheim’s seminal research on suicide highlighted the importance of social connections in promoting individual well-being as well as how disruptions in social connections can increase overall risk for suicide at a societal level (Durkheim, 1951). The public health impact of loneliness should not be underestimated, particularly among youth (Goosby, Bellatorre, Walsemann, & Cheadle, 2013). From a developmental perspective, loneliness is especially relevant to youth populations, as the need for social acceptance and belongingness is prominent during adolescence and young adulthood. Although it is too early to fully understand the impact of physical distancing due to COVID-19 on health and mental health, existing research has found that people who do not feel connected to others are more likely to suffer from respiratory illness (Cohen et al., 1997), report depression and anxiety (Kawachi & Berkman, 2001), and experience suicidality (Stravynski & Boyer, 2001). In line with the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, connection to others can fulfill youths’ need to belong, thereby reducing risk for suicidality (Joiner et al., 2009). Thus, social connection has become a crucial component of suicide prevention. Among LGBTQ individuals in particular, connection to the LGBTQ community has been found to buffer the impact of stigma on depression and suicidality (Kaniuka et al., 2019). To address the potential negative social impacts of physical distancing, efforts must be made to ensure that LGBTQ youth know that they are not alone and feel encouraged to seek support and social connections through means that do not rely on physical proximity. First, it is important for LGBTQ youth and those who support them to remember that physical distancing does not equate with social isolation. There is already a thriving online LGBTQ community that allows LGBTQ youth to experience connections with others like them. Further, LGBTQ youth should be encouraged to maintain existing connections through virtual means such as video calls and video conferencing. Youth should also be encouraged to participate in shared activities such as online gaming, watch parties, or physical activity classes. Those in positions to support or serve as role models to LGBTQ youth, including the media and LGBTQ organizations, should encourage them to maintain social connections virtually and practice self-care during COVID-19. Doing so may result in LGBTQ youth actively seeking and maintaining connections and engaging in wellness activities that will positively impact their mental and physical health. A Special Note on School Interactions LGBTQ youth may lose access to positive connections, including extracurricular activities, as a result of school closings. Across the nation, secondary and higher education institutions are closing their physical locations to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In addition to the educational opportunities provided by our nation’s schools, these institutions also provide social opportunities, activity involvement such as sports and clubs, and access to supportive adults such as teachers, coaches, and school counselors. For LGBTQ youth, school can also offer access to an LGBTQ community, such as through Gender and Sexualities Alliances (GSAs), as well as connection to counseling and mental health resources. GSAs provide LGBTQ youth and allies with safe environments where they can feel empowered, socialize, and receive support, and the presence of GSAs has been found to significantly reduce the risk for depression and increase well-being among LGBTQ youth and young adults (Toomey et al., 2011). LGBTQ youth who report the presence of trusted adults in their school also have higher levels of self-esteem (Dessel et al., 2017). Further, access to supportive peers is protective against anxiety and depression, including among those who lack support from their family (Parra et al., 2018). Schools also offer youth the ability to participate in extracurricular activities and clubs, which have been found to promote positive youth development (Eccles et al., 2003). LGBTQ youth participate in club and arts-focused activities at comparable levels to their straight/cisgender peers and receive similar positive benefits from extracurricular activity involvement (Toomey & Russell, 2013). As schools move their academic curriculum to online delivery, there is a need to ensure that protective factors provided by schools such as supportive individuals and extracurricular activities can also be accessed virtually. Given the known benefits of activity involvement, schools should identify and promote activities that may provide similar benefits without jeopardizing physical distancing. LGBTQ youth should be encouraged to seek and take advantage of opportunities that allow them to connect with others in shared activities outside of the walls of their schools. Teachers and health professionals in schools should also make office hours available to provide support to students. Additionally, schools should work to ensure that opportunities, such as GSA involvement, are available to students virtually when schools are in session. School professionals should also attend to ways that school bullying and cyberbullying might be experienced differently in new online school communities and work to monitor and minimize instances of cyberbullying. Increase in Negative Social Interactions For LGBTQ youth, physical distancing may have additional unintended negative consequences related to being confined to an environment that may be unsupportive or abusive. Based on existing research on rates of family rejection, many youth will spend their days confined to places that are unsupportive of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity for an indefinite amount of time. Research suggests that among LGBTQ youth, only one-third experience parental acceptance, with an additional one-third experiencing parental rejection, and the final one-third not disclosing their LGBTQ identity until they are adults (Katz-Wise et al., 2015). Another study found that LGB young adults who report high levels of parental rejection are eight times more likely to report attempting suicide and six times more likely to report high levels of depression (Ryan et al., 2009). Unsupportive environments may result in increased dysphoria, particularly among transgender and/or nonbinary youth, as some may need to hide their authentic selves to maintain safety. Furthermore, LGBTQ youth report greater rates sexual, psychological, and physical abuse than their straight/cisgender peers (Baams, et al., 2018; Friedman et al., 2011). Intimate partner violence is also more prevalent in the LGBTQ community, including among youth and young adults (Calton et al., 2016). As such, some home environments may pose serious risks to LGBTQ youth mental and physical health. Youth who find themselves in an environment that does not affirm their identity, or places them at risk for abuse and victimization, can benefit from access to supportive individuals to help them maintain their own safety while also providing an outlet for them to be their authentic selves. LGBTQ youth should seek affirming connections either through existing support networks or by joining safe online spaces for LGBTQ youth. These connections can allow them space to talk about their experiences at home as well as affirmations that they are valued and loved as their authentic self. An unintended consequence of physical distancing is that it may provide less opportunities for mandated reporters and other concerned individuals to observe signs of potential abuse and domestic violence. Those in direct contact with LGBTQ youth can ask them directly about whether or not they feel safe and supported in their current living situation. Further, public communications about COVID-19 should include contact information for the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233) as well information on how to access to state child abuse and neglect hotlines. Efforts to proactively support youth in non-supportive environments can help youth problem-solve to promote physical and emotional safety and allow them to see that they are not alone. ECONOMIC STRAIN Economic strain is characterized by how difficult individuals find it to live on their current income. LGBTQ individuals have significantly worse economic strain compared to the broader U.S. population, marked by increased rates of underemployment or unemployment as well as increased rates of housing instability (Hunter et al., 2018). Experts predict that COVID-19 will result in substantial negative economic impacts around the world (Anderson et al., 2020). For LGBTQ populations, these impacts may be felt more intensely as they are already more likely to lack economic resources. Unemployment Concerns Increased unemployment rates are occurring across the country as a result of COVID-19, with concerns about the impacts this will have on mental health and suicidality, particularly among vulnerable populations such as LGBTQ youth. Experts from the United Nations’ International Labour Organization are predicting a rise in global unemployment due to COVID-19, which may compare or exceed that experienced during the global financial crisis of 2008 (International Labour Organization, 2020; Martin, 2020). Studies on the impact of the 2008 “Great Recession” revealed accelerated increases in rates of suicide mortality across Europe and the U.S., with rates rising by 60% in Greece which was most heavily impacted by the 2008 financial crisis (Chang et al., 2013; Reeves et al., 2012). Between 2007 and 2010, the rates of unemployment in the U.S. increased from 5.8% to 9.6%, with these rising unemployment rates accounting for a significant increase in nation’s suicide deaths during this time (Reeves et al., 2012). Youth are included among the populations who have experienced negative mental health and suicidality outcomes related to economic downturns and recessions (Frasquiho et al, 2015). These impacts may be especially pronounced among LGBTQ populations who experience both higher rates of unemployment (Hunter, McGovern, & Sutherland, 2018) and higher rates of suicidality (Green, Price-Feeney, Dorison, 2020; Johns et al., 2019), particularly among those who identify as transgender and/or nonbinary (Leppel, 2019; Price-Feeney, Green, & Dorison, 2020) and/or LGBTQ people of color (Movement Advancement Project et al., 2013; The Trevor Project, 2019a). Unemployment resources and mental health services can help reduce risk for suicidality, even during times of global economic strain. During the “Great Recession,” not all countries experienced significant increases in suicide deaths, despite experiencing negative economic impacts of a recession. Countries who did not experience significant increased in suicide deaths had implemented programs that helped those who were unemployed find resources and social support and had strong mental health prevention programs (Reeves et al., 2012). There is a need to ensure that LGBTQ individuals have support in applying for and accessing unemployment funds. Further, non-discrimination policies related to sexual orientation and gender identity can also facilitate employment opportunities for LGBTQ youth. LGBTQ organizations can also work to create and identify professional development opportunities to assist LGBTQ youth seeking employment. Housing Instability Economic strains can lead to substantial increases in housing instability, with LGBTQ youth disproportionally impacted by housing instability. Even before the spread of coronavirus, LGBTQ youth are represented at over twice the overall youth rate in reports of unstable housing (Baams, Wilson, & Russell, 2019). And LGBTQ youth who experienced housing instability were twice as likely to report seriously considering suicide and three times as likely to report attempting suicide compared to LGBTQ youth who had not (The Trevor Project, 2019b). Individuals who experience unemployment due to COVID-19, may subsequently be at increased risk for housing instability and homelessness. During the “Great Recession,” housing instability was found to account for a significant amount of the accelerated increases in suicide deaths in the U.S. (Fowler et al., 2015). This connection is especially concerning for LGBTQ youth, who may be less able to rely on family support (Rhoades et al., 2018), as a previous study found that perceived family support buffered the impact between housing instability and negative outcomes during the “Great Recession” (Murphy, 2014). Policy changes, social support, and attention to mental health may mitigate the impacts of housing instability related to COVID-19 on LGBTQ youth. From a policy perspective, moratoriums on evictions and rent freezes during this pandemic can help those experiencing economic strain to maintain safe shelter and, in turn, reduce risk for suicidality. Organizations serving LGBTQ youth should be cognizant of the impact housing instability can have on youth well-being and ensure that LGBTQ youth are supported now more than ever. There is also a need for organizations providing services to individuals who may be experiencing housing instability to ensure that their staff and services are LGBTQ-affirming to reduce barriers for LGBTQ youth in accessing needed services and resources. WORRIES ABOUT PRESENT AND FUTURE Uncertainties surrounding the impact COVID-19 may have at an individual and societal level can lead to anxiety about an individual’s day-to-day life as well as anxiety related to what the future may hold for them. This increased anxiety can negatively impact LGBTQ youth’s mental and physical health. Struggles in the Present COVID-19 may cause increases in youth anxiety related to the health of themselves and their loved ones, potential interactions with the U.S. healthcare system, and continued ability to meet basic needs. Youth may experience increased anxiety related to oneself or a loved one contracting the virus, particularly among those with pre-existing conditions such as asthma or those who are immunocompromised. Health anxiety–fear of, or preoccupation with, serious illness–was already presumed to have been on the rise in recent decades due to a combination of rises in rates of both general anxiety and access to health information over the Internet (Kosic, Lindholm, Järvholm, & Hedman-Lagerlöf, 2020). A pandemic health event, such as the current spread of COVID-19, likely further exacerbates health anxiety in people. Although access to constantly updated information has potential benefits, health anxious individuals actually experience more negative consequences from online health information (Baumgartner & Hartmann, 2011). Further, due to high rates of discrimination in the healthcare system (Lambda Legal, 2010) and experiences with non-affirming care (Rossman, Salamanca, Macapagal, 2017), LGBTQ individuals may also experience anxiety about having to seek medical attention if they are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. There is a need for services that allow LGBTQ youth to discuss their anxieties with individuals who can provide them with social support and assist them in exploring ways they may be able to access additional resources. Given the significant physical risks associated with pandemics, it is often not until well after disease containment that mental health and psychological support programs begin to be prioritized; however, it is important to act early in the prevention of lasting mental health outcomes. With LGBTQ youth already being at increased risk for anxiety disorders (Borgogna, McDermott, Aita, Kridel, 2018; Russell & Rish, 2016), it is imperative to work to prevent an increase in mental health conditions resulting from this pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to result in decreased physical access to individuals training in mental health and suicide prevention, as such, LGBTQ youth need to be able to access remote support through telehealth as well as phone and digital based crisis services. Further, given anticipated economic strains, it is important that LGBTQ youth have 24/7 access to support that is provided at no cost to them. Struggles About the Future For many LGBTQ youth, their futures may burn brighter than their present; however, COVID-19 can make the future less certain and more distant. In addition to feeling concerned about the present, youth may also be experiencing anxiety related to expectations for the future, including those related to school, future relationships, and the path to their future goals and aspirations. While feelings of anxiety related to these changes might already be present for youth, the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to exacerbate what is already present or introduce new concerns for youth. Concerns about being able to achieve independence, a normative part of development at this age (Cohen, 1980), is likely to impact youth due to uncertainty regarding when the country will return to normal. Specific to LGBTQ youth, oftentimes leaving home might be an adaptive way to cope with conflict and/or maltreatment at home (Bidell, 2014). LGBTQ youth may also be waiting until they are adults to disclose their identity to their parents (Katz-Wise et al., 2015). LGBTQ minors who are not in supportive environments and have been waiting until they were able to graduate high school or become the legal age to move to a more supportive environment, perhaps for school and/or work, might feel as though the pandemic is halting or postponing their ability to live as, and embrace, their true selves. Access to supportive individuals and online communities might help alleviate anxiety about the future and provide an outlet for identity support and expression for LGBTQ youth. It is important that LGBTQ youth who are experiencing increased levels of anxiety during this time have access to supportive individuals with whom they can discuss their concerns and consider strategies that may help alleviate some of this anxiety for them. These individuals can support youth not only in helping with adjusting to the possibility of new timeframes and what that may mean, but also in their LGBTQ identity. LGBTQ youth may find it particularly helpful to utilize online communities through which they may feel more open to trying out their LGBTQ identity if they are not able to do so in their current environment. One study found that LGTBQ youth were able to find increased comfort with their identities, even through just watching others’ journeys, and that the Internet supported their coming out process by often being the first place they do so (Craig & McInroy, 2014). Access to such resources can help provide LGBTQ youth with outside support and hope to allow them to get through the current crisis while looking forward to a future with increased autonomy and the ability to live authentically. TREVOR’S ROLE The Trevor Project is uniquely positioned to provide a range of support to LGBTQ youth throughout this pandemic. We have worked to ensure that we are able to maintain all of our services 24/7. We also offer an array of options for youth ranging from our LGBTQ peer support community TrevorSpace, to our trained crisis service counselors, and our support resources for LGBTQ youth on topics relevant to them such as coming out and being an ally to transgender and nonbinary youth. LGBTQ youth seeking community while physically distant from usual support can join TrevorSpace, the world’s largest safe space social networking site for LGBTQ youth. It provides LGBTQ youth and allies with a safe, affirming community and the opportunity to connect with people who might be going through similar experiences. Finding a safe community online can be a powerful way to deal with physical isolation, receive support, and explore their identity. TrevorText, TrevorChat, and TrevorLifeline, provide 24/7 support to youth in crisis. LGBTQ youth who experience anxiety and concerns over their physical or mental health or their economic situation can find a trained adult ready to listen and support them. Our research shows that LGBTQ youth who have one or more accepting adults are 40% less likely to attempt suicide (The Trevor Project, 2019c). In an external evaluation of Trevor’s crisis services, over 90% of youth with with suicide risk during their interaction with Trevor were successfully de-escalated. Now more than ever, it’s important to take action to support the needs of LGBTQ youth. Even when practicing physical distancing, LGBTQ youth should know that they are not alone. CONCLUSION This research paper brought together a wide range of academic literature to consider how the current global pandemic may impact LGBTQ youth. In particular, it focused on social interactions resulting from physical distancing, increases in economic strain, and struggles with worries about the present and future. The Trevor Project is committed to ensuring that LGBTQ youth are supported throughout this pandemic by providing 24/7 access to an affirming international community for LGBTQ young people and trained crisis counselors to talk directly with youth with youth in crisis. We hope others will join us in helping LGBTQ youth know that they are not alone and provide the social, economic, and mental health support they need during these unprecedented times.

LGBTQ Youth in Small Towns and Rural Areas [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.thetrevorproject.org/research-briefs/lgbtq-youth-in-small-towns-and-rural-areas/)

> Youth's Lives Every Day Background Among the broader population of youth ages 10â24 in the U.S., suicide rates are higher in rural than in urban communities (Fontanella et al., 2015). Further, data from GLSENâs National School Climate Survey indicate that LGBTQ youth from small towns or rural areas are more likely to hear anti-LGBTQ remarks and experience discrimination in schools than those from urban and suburban schools (Kosciw et al., 2020). However, little research has specifically examined differences in mental health and suicide risk based on whether LGBTQ youth live in urban or rural areas. One study of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning (LGBQ) youth found that, although both rural and non-rural LGBQ youth reported significantly greater risk of depression compared to their non-LGBQ peers, there were no significant differences in depression when comparing rural LGBQ youth to LGBQ youth from urban and suburban areas (Price-Feeney, Ybarra, & Mitchell, 2019). Further, a study of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth in Canada also found similar rates of depression among rural and urban youth; however, they found that rural LGB boys, but not rural LGB girls, were more likely to consider and attempt suicide than those from urban and suburban areas (Poon & Saewyc, 2009). Given the mixed findings on LGBTQ youth in rural areas and small towns, there is a need for additional research, particularly among transgender and nonbinary youth. Using data from The Trevor Projectâs 2021 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health, this brief examines depression and suicide risk among LGBTQ youth from rural areas and small towns compared to urban and suburban areas. Results Nearly half (49%) of LGBTQ youth in rural areas and small towns stated that their community was somewhat or very unaccepting of LGBTQ people compared to just over a quarter (26%) of those in urban and suburban areas. In total, only 4% of rural LGBTQ youth reported that their community was very accepting of LGBTQ people. Approximately half of the sample lived in urban (15%) or suburban (34%) areas, with the other half living in a small city/town (41%) or rural area (10%). LGBTQ youth in rural areas and small towns also reported higher rates of experiencing LGBTQ-based discrimination (61% vs. 56%) and physical harm (21% vs. 17%) in the past year compared to those in urban and suburban areas. LGBTQ youth in rural areas and small towns had slightly greater odds of experiencing symptoms of depression (aOR = 1.09, p<.001), considering suicide (aOR = 1.14, p<.001), and attempting suicide (aOR = 1.19, p<.001) compared to those in urban and suburban areas. Generally, rates were only slightly higher among those in small towns and rural areas than those in urban and suburban areas. While transgender and nonbinary youth generally had worse mental health and suicide risk compared to cisgender LGBQ youth, those from small towns and rural areas reported only slightly higher rates of depression (71% vs 69%), considering suicide (53% and 48%), and attempting suicide (21% vs 19%) compared to those from urban and suburban areas. Differences between small towns/rural areas and urban/suburban areas were also relatively comparable within gender identity (e.g., cisgender boy/man, cisgender girl/woman, transgender boy/man, transgender girl/woman, and nonbinary youth). Access to LGBTQ-affirming schools in small towns and rural areas is associated with lower suicide risk. Although LGBTQ youth from small towns and rural areas had less access to LGBTQ-affirming schools (48% vs. 56%) than those in urban and suburban areas, those with affirming schools had 35% lower odds of attempting suicide in the past year (aOR = 0.65). Further, among transgender and nonbinary youth, access to schools that were gender-affirming was associated with an over 25% lower risk of a past-year suicide attempt (aOR = 0.74, p<.001). However, transgender and nonbinary youth in small towns and rural areas had less access to gender-affirming schools (40% vs. 46%) than those in urban and suburban areas. Methods Data were collected from an online survey conducted between October and December of 2020 of 34,759 LGBTQ youth recruited via targeted ads on social media. To determine the type of area where youth resided, they were asked, âWhich of the following best describes the area you live in?â with response options of 1) In a large city, 2) Just outside of a large city (such as in a suburb), 3) In a small city or town, or 4) In a rural area (such as out in the country). For the current report, those who selected large city or just outside the city were considered urban or suburban, while those who selected small city, town, or rural area were considered rural or small town. Items on considering and attempting suicide in the past 12 months were taken from the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionâs Youth Risk Behavior Survey (Johns et al., 2020). Depression was measured using the PHQ-2 (Richardson et al., 2010). All LGBTQ youth in the sample were asked to endorse whether or not their school (if enrolled) was LGBTQ-affirming. Transgender and nonbinary youth were also asked whether their school (if enrolled) was gender-affirming. Adjusted logistic regression models controlled for race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, sex assigned at birth, gender identity, and sexual identity. Looking Ahead Supporting previous research, these findings show that despite higher levels of rejection, discrimination, and victimization experienced by LGBTQ youth in small towns and rural areas, the resulting disparities in depression and suicide risk are relatively small. For example, in our data, LGBTQ youth in small towns and rural areas reported more than double the rate of living in a community that was unaccepting of LGBTQ people compared to those in urban and suburban areas, yet the odds of experiencing depression, considering suicide, or attempting suicide were only 10â20% greater. Together, these findings indicate that there are likely protective factors that operate to minimize disparities in mental health and suicide risk in small towns and rural regions. Future research should explore positive experiences and/or strengths reported by LGBTQ youth in small towns and rural regions to determine which factors facilitate well-being even in environments that are less accepting of LGBTQ people. Although LGBTQ youth in small towns and rural regions had lower rates of reporting their schools to be LGBTQ- or gender-affirming spaces, those who had access to affirming schools reported significantly lower rates of attempting suicide in the past year. Such findings, along with higher rates of LGBTQ-based discrimination and victimization in small towns and rural areas, point to the need for greater investment in school policies and practices that support LGBTQ youth in small towns and rural areas. Although implementing school policies and practices to support LGBTQ youth in small towns and rural areas is often fraught with barriers such as fewer LGBTQ-specific community resources and greater anti-LGBTQ sentiment in the community (Green et al., 2018), making these changes at the school level can allow youth to be supported in their identity, and perhaps thrive in ways beyond their LGBTQ peers in urban and suburban areas, given other potential protective factors found in small towns and rural areas. The Trevor Project is committed to finding ways for all LGBTQ youth to feel safe and supported. LGBTQ youth in small towns and rural areas may have less access to in-person affirmation and support, creating a greater need for our 24/7 crisis services to connect with an accepting and affirming adult as well as our TrevorSpace platform to connect with supportive peers. Trevorâs research, advocacy, and education teams are focused on ensuring that LGBTQ youth, and stakeholders working directly with them across all regions and locations, are included in efforts to prevent suicide and achieve access to life-saving resources.

> Youth's Lives Every Day Multiracial LGBTQ youth report 10% higher rates of considering suicide and nearly 30% higher rates of suicide attempts in the past year compared to their peers August 8, 2022 â A new report released today by The Trevor Project, the worldâs largest suicide prevention and mental health organization for LGBTQ young people, is the first of its kind to exclusively explore the mental health and well-being of LGBTQ youth, highlighting the unique mental health experiences among youth of different racial backgrounds. Key findings include: Nearly half of multiracial LGBTQ youth (48%) reported seriously considering suicide in the past year, compared to 45% of all LGBTQ youth - Nearly one in five multiracial LGBTQ youth (17%) attempted suicide in the past year, compared to 14% of all LGBTQ youth - Multiracial transgender and nonbinary youth reported higher rates of suicide risk, with 55% seriously considering suicide and 22% attempting suicide in the past year - Multiracial LGBTQ youth who are exclusively youth of color reported higher rates of both seriously considering (52%) and attempting suicide (21%) in the past year compared to multiracial LGBTQ youth who are White and another race/ethnicity - âThese findings shine a light on the unique mental health challenges and suicide risk of young people living with the distinctive identities of being multiracial and LGBTQ. The research world has largely overlooked this group of young people and how they might experience various risk and protective factors,â said Myeshia Price (she/her or they/them pronouns), Director of Research Science at The Trevor Project. âThese novel findings overwhelmingly point to an urgent need to invest in mental health services and prevention programs that specifically affirm the identities of multiracial LGBTQ youth and are attuned to the nuances of how they navigate and experience the world.â Multiracial LGBTQ youth reported higher rates of negative risk factors â such as experiences of homelessness, food insecurity, and discrimination and victimization based on their race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, or gender identity â than their peers. In particular, multiracial LGBTQ youth who are exclusively youth of color reported higher rates of race/ethnicity-based discrimination compared to multiracial LGBTQ youth who are White and another race/ethnicity (55% vs. 37%). These findings highlight the potential role that racism contributes to poor mental health among young people of color. These data also illustrate protective factors unique to multiracial LGBTQ youth, which may play an important role in uplifting their wellbeing and preventing suicide. Multiracial LGBTQ youth who reported high levels of social support from family and high levels of support from friends had significantly lower odds of attempting suicide in the past year than youth who did not have that support (55% and 39%). This report was created using data from a national sample of nearly 4,739 multiracial LGBTQ youth ages 13â24 who participated in The Trevor Projectâs 2022 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health. The full report can be found here.

This quantitative cross-sectional survey was conducted using an online survey platform between September and December 2021 among nearly 34,000 youth ages 13â24 residing in the United States. All youth respondents were asked, âWhat best describes your race or ethnicity?â with options: Asian/Asian American, Black/African American, Hispanic or Latino/Latinx, more than one race or ethnicity, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian, White/Caucasian, and another race or ethnicity (please specify). Youth who selected more than one race or ethnicity were asked a follow-up question where they were able to select with which races or ethnicities they identified. The current analyses include the 4,739 LGBTQ youth who selected more than one race or ethnicity, henceforth referred to as multiracial. Visit here for additional information on methodology. About The Trevor Project The Trevor ProjectÂ is the world’s largest suicide prevention and mental health organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer & questioning (LGBTQ) young people. The Trevor Project offers a suite of 24/7 crisis intervention and suicide prevention programs, includingÂ TrevorLifeline,Â TrevorText, and TrevorChat,Â as well as the worldâs largest safe space social networking site for LGBTQ youth, TrevorSpace.

School-Related Protective Factors for LGBTQ Middle and High School Students [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.thetrevorproject.org/research-briefs/school-related-protective-factors-for-lgbtq-middle-and-high-school-students-aug-2023/)

> Youth's Lives Every Day Background Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) young people have higher rates of suicide risk and victimization than their cisgender and straight peers (Johns et al., 2020). An affirming environment, including school, for LGBTQ young people can improve their mental health and reduce their risk of suicide (Hatzenbuehler 2011; Russel et al., 2018); however, 68% of LGBTQ students reported feeling unsafe at school because of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression (Kosciw et al., 2022). Young people between the ages of 13 and 18 spend a significant portion of their waking hours at schools, making it imperative to examine how schools can create affirming environments for LGBTQ students in middle or high school. That said, it remains unclear what adults in these spaces can specifically do to make them more affirming for LGBTQ students. Building on our previous work showing that LGBTQ students who learn about suicide prevention or LGBTQ issues in school have lower rates of attempting suicide in the past year (The Trevor Project, 2021), this current study uses data from The Trevor Project’s 2023 National Survey on the Mental Health of LGBTQ Young People to explore the protectiveness associated with five school-related factors among LGBTQ middle and high school students: 1) learning about LGBTQ people and experiences in sex education, 2) learning about LGBTQ stories and people in history class, 3) having access to a gender-neutral bathroom, 4) the presence of an on-campus Gender and Sexuality Alliance or a Gay Straight Alliance (GSA), and 5) teachers who respect student’s pronouns. Results LGBTQ middle and high school students with access to at least one of these school-related protective factors had 26% lower odds of attempting suicide in the past year. Specifically, 17% of LGBTQ middle and high school students who did not have access to gender-neutral bathrooms in school reported attempting suicide in the past year compared to 14% who did. Additionally, LGBTQ middle and high school students who were taught history that included LGBTQ stories and people reported lower rates of attempting suicide in the past year (14%) compared to those who were not (16%). Transgender and nonbinary middle and high school students who reported that most or all of their teachers respect their pronouns reported lower rates of attempting suicide in the past year (19%) compared to those who reported fewer teachers respected their pronouns (22%). Finally, LGBTQ middle and high school students with access to a GSA or similar club on campus reported lower rates of attempting suicide in the past year (14%) compared to those who did not (18%). Learning about LGBTQ experiences in sex education was not associated with significantly different rates of suicide attempts in the past year, but it was associated with lower rates of considering suicide in the past year. Overall, LGBTQ middle and high school students with at least one of these school-related protective factors had 26% lower odds of reporting a suicide attempt in the past year compared to LGBTQ middle and high school students who did not have any of these school-related protective factors (aOR=0.74, CI [0.67, 0.84], p < 0.01). The majority of LGBTQ middle and high school students (70%) had access to at least one school-related protective factor. Among all LGBTQ students in middle school and high school, 57% attended a school with a GSA or similar club in the most recent school year, 29% had access to a gender-neutral bathroom, 15% were taught sex education that included discussions about LGBTQ people and experiences, and 14% were taught history that included LGBTQ stories and people. Additionally, 25% of transgender and nonbinary middle and high school students said most or all teachers respected their pronouns. That said, LGBTQ students in high school reported significantly higher rates of all of these school-related protective factors compared to their LGBTQ peers in middle school, with the exception of sex education that included discussions about LGBTQ people and experiences. Overall, 35% of LGBTQ students in middle and high school had access to only one of these protective factors, 36% had access to at least two, 14% had access to at least three of the protective factors, 4% had access to at least four, and only 1% of LGBTQ students in middle and high school had access to all five of the assessed protective factors. LGBTQ middle and high school students who had at least one of these school-related protective factors had three times higher odds of reporting their school as LGBTQ-affirming. Overall, 55% of LGBTQ middle and high school students reported that their school was LGBTQ-affirming. 65% of LGBTQ students in middle and high school who reported their school had a GSA or similar club in the past year reported their school was LGBTQ-affirming, compared to 39% when a GSA or similar club was not present. Two-thirds (67%) of LGBTQ students in middle and high school with a gender-neutral bathroom at school reported their school was LGBTQ-affirming compared to less than half (48%) of those who did not have a gender-neutral bathroom. When LGBTQ students in middle and high school were taught sex education that discussed LGBTQ people and experiences, 68% reported their school was LGBTQ-affirming compared to 51% who did not have sex education inclusive of LGBTQ people and experiences. The majority (80%) of transgender and nonbinary middle and high school students who reported that most or all of their teachers respected their pronouns said their school was LGBTQ-affirming compared to 51% of transgender and nonbinary students who reported their pronouns were respected by fewer teachers. Finally, when history that includes LGBTQ stories and people was taught, 70% of LGBTQ students in middle and high school reported their school as affirming compared to 51% when history that includes LGBTQ stories and people was not taught. Overall, when LGBTQ young people had at least one of these school-related protective factors, 62% reported their schools as LGBTQ- affirming compared to 34% who had none of these protective factors (aOR=3.15, 95% CI [2.85, 3.49], p < 0.01). Methods Data were collected from an online survey conducted between September 1 and December 12, 2022. Individuals between the ages of 13 and 24 who resided in the United States were recruited via targeted ads on social media. The sample for this brief was restricted to 15,791 young people who reported they were ages 13 to 18 and that they attended middle school or high school. The respondents were asked, “Have you ever learned about the following subjects in school?” Participants had the option to select any of the following which applied to them: “Suicide Prevention,” “Sex education that talks about LGBTQ people and experiences,” or “History that includes LGBTQ stories and people.” To determine information about students’ experiences with GSAs, young people were asked “Did the school that you attended during the most recent school year have a Gay/Straight Alliance (GSA) or another type of club that focuses on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) issues?” They could select from the response options “No,” “Yes,” “I am not sure what this is,” and “I know what this is, but do not know if my school had one.” Responses were dichotomized to compare those who answered “Yes” to any other selection. Participants were also asked, “How many of your teachers/professors respect your pronouns (as in, use the pronouns you want them to use for you)?” The response options were “None of them,” “A few of them,” “Some of them,” “A lot of them,” and “All or most of them,” which were dichotomized such that students who responded “All or most of them” were compared to all other students. Participants were also asked, “Is there a gender-neutral bathroom at your school?” to which they could respond, “No,” “Yes,” or “I don’t know.” The items for measuring considering and attempting suicide are from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey (Johns et al., 2020). Chi-square tests were used to compare groups. Adjusted logistic regression controlling for age, Census Region, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, gender identity, and sexual orientation was performed to calculate adjusted odds ratios. All reported comparisons and adjusted odds ratios are statistically significant at least at p<0.05. This means that there is less than a 5% likelihood these results occurred by chance. Looking Ahead This brief demonstrates significant associations between school-related protective factors and LGBTQ middle and high school students’ suicide risk. The findings suggest that attending a school with a GSA or other similar club, learning about LGBTQ people and experiences, having access to a gender-neutral bathroom, and having teachers who respect their pronouns are all associated with lower suicide risk among LGBTQ students in middle and high school. Furthermore, students attending schools with these characteristics reported higher rates of having an LGBTQ-affirming school compared to those without them, which is also associated with lower suicide risk (Trevor, 2022). Alarmingly, just under 1 in 3 (30%) of LGBTQ students in middle school or high school report not having access to any of these protective factors. Furthermore, the disparity between middle and high school student access to them is particularly concerning given the higher rate of suicide attempts among LGBTQ students in middle school (20%) compared to high school (16%). Overall, these findings provide concrete actions for educators and administrators to take in ensuring that all of their students are safe and affirmed in the spaces they are mandated to be in. Recently passed state laws may prevent many of these important actions to affirm LGBTQ young people such as creating curriculum and offering student clubs that affirm LGBTQ young people, implementing policies around respecting pronouns, and providing gender-neutral bathrooms, despite the protective associations they have for LGBTQ students’ mental health. As of June 2023, over 100 curriculum censorship state-level active bills have been proposed in the United States (The Trevor Project, 2023a). These bills are in direct contradiction to these findings and other scholarship (Russel et al, 2018.; Hatzenbuehler 2011), which have documented the relationships between the affirmation of LGBTQ identities in schools and better mental health among LGBTQ students. Parents/caregivers, teachers, school staff, and other stakeholders should advocate on behalf of LGBTQ young people to ensure they are just as comfortable, safe, and affirmed as their cisgender and straight peers at school. The Trevor Project remains committed to providing support to LGBTQ young people in schools. Our advocacy team encourages schools to implement the Model School District Policy on Suicide Prevention which was developed by The Trevor Project, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP), the American School Counselor Association (ASCA), and the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP). Our website offers a number of resources for adults working with LGBTQ young people, including the Guide to Being an Ally to Transgender and Nonbinary Youth, How to Support Bisexual Youth, and Preventing Suicide. Our TrevorSpace social media platform connects young people with supportive peers, and our 24/7 crisis services are available in three different modalities – phone, chat, and text – for LGBTQ young people to connect with affirming counselors when they are in crisis.

Support for LGBTQ+ Self-Harm Recovery [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.thetrevorproject.org/resources/article/support-for-self-harm-recovery/)

> Youth's Lives Every Day There are lots of ways to feel better without harming yourself. Self-injury, also known as self-harm, is the act of trying to get rid of an unbearable mood by causing physical harm that damages the body. For many young people, self-injury is the best method they have found for dealing with the pain in their lives. Although it may sound contradictory, since this involves hurting oneself, self-injury can sometimes be a method young people use to help them survive. However, there are some individuals who use self-injury as a “dry run” before a suicide attempt. If you are feeling suicidal, please know that you are not alone. You can call the Trevor Lifeline at 1-866-488-7386 or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline for LGBTQ+-inclusive self-harm hotlines. A common form of self-injury is cutting, which is when someone makes shallow cuts on their body using a knife or another sharp object – but 75% of those that self-injure use multiple methods. Other methods include burning, scratching, picking and/or interfering with wound healing, head banging and the breaking of bones. LGBTQ+ Self-Harm Support: First Aid and Behavioral Alternatives If you self-injure, using basic first aid and safety skills is always important. It’s important to recognize that self-injury can cause a variety of complications, like permanent scarring, or feelings of shame, guilt and low self-esteem. Even if a person doesn’t mean to hurt themselves seriously, life-threatening problems can happen; such as blood loss, if major blood vessels or arteries are cut. Self-injury can also lead to accidental or deliberate suicide. Fortunately, there are many alternatives to self-injury that can produce the same relief. If you’re ready to stop, consider these LGBTQ+ self-injury support options to find what works for you: - If cutting helps release anger… hit a pillow, stomp the ground, rip paper, flatten cans. - If cutting reduces tension… run, do yoga, meditate, stretch a rubber band and let it go. - If cutting helps ease sadness… chat with a friend, listen to a favorite song, eat some comfort food, write out your feelings, do something that makes you feel supported. - If cutting helps you feel less numb… create a sharp physical feeling, like putting your hand in ice water, snapping a rubber band on your wrist, or clapping your hands hard. Frequently Asked Questions Regarding Self-Harm - Why do people self-harm? - Can self-injury have any complications? - I want to stop hurting myself, but I can’t figure out where to begin. - I feel super alone with all of this. Who can I trust to help me? Question 1: Why do people self-harm? Answer: Most people self-harm as a way of dealing with difficult, painful, overwhelming emotions. However, every person does it for a different reason. It’s important to understand the meaning self-harm has for each individual before assuming why they’re hurting themselves. People self-harm to: - Relieve tension and overwhelming emotions. - Return them to reality and make them feel alive again, sometimes after seeing blood. - Establish control after feeling like they have little to no control over their environment. - Seek security and a reliable outcome. For example, cutting will always produce blood. - Feel special and unique. Some say that disapproval adds to a sense of satisfaction. - Influence or punish others, or prove how strong their emotions are. - Punish themselves due to negative self-perceptions. - Evoke a good mood. One theory is that the pain involved in self-injury may release endorphins (natural painkillers) that reduce emotional pain. A cycle is formed in which habitual self-injurers hurt themselves in order to feel better. Whatever the reason, it is important to recognize that self-harm is a symptom of larger concerns and seek out self-harm recovery resources. If you know someone who may be suicidal and is self-harming, please encourage them to call the Trevor Lifeline at 1-866-488-7386. It’s free and available 24/7. Question 2: Can self-harm have any complications? Answer: Self-harming, like cutting, might help the person feel better briefly, but the longer it goes on, the more dangerous it can become. Remember, self-harm is the act of physically hurting yourself. Serious blood loss after hitting a vein or artery, permanent scarring, serious infections, or even accidental suicide, are a few examples of life-threatening medical emergencies that can happen if someone who self-harms isn’t careful. Self-harming can also increase someone’s feelings of shame, guilt, depression, and lack of control. Question 3: I want to stop hurting myself, but I can’t figure out where to begin. Answer: There are few questions that might be helpful to think about as you start your process: Have you found new ways to handle the triggers that usually spark your desire to hurt yourself? Have you thought about other activities you can do instead of self-injuring? Is there a reason why you’re ready to stop now? Do you have an emotional support system, like people who you can talk to about your self-injury? If you start asking yourselves these questions and find that you are not comfortable with the idea of stopping, don’t be discouraged. You can work toward gaining more control over your self-injury by setting boundaries with yourself about when and how much you hurt yourself. If you feel like hurting yourself, there are lots of ways to help yourself feel better without putting yourself at risk. Think about how you feel before and after you hurt yourself. What happens after you’ve hurt yourself – do you feel less sad, more in control, or less angry? There are alternative activities you can do to help find the same relief you currently find through self-injury. Check out these ideas to get started, or come up with some of your own: - If cutting helps release anger…hit a pillow, stomp the ground, rip paper, flatten cans. - If cutting reduces tension…run, do yoga, meditate, stretch a rubber band and let it go. - If cutting helps ease sadness…chat with a friend, listen to a favorite song, eat some comfort food, write out your feelings, do something that makes you feel supported. - If cutting helps you feel less numb…create a sharp physical feeling, like putting your hand in ice water, snapping a rubber band on your wrist, or clapping your hands hard. - If cutting helps you feel in control…play a game where you can control a character’s experiences, write stories, set physical activity goals for yourself and beat your record. Keep in mind that many people continue to search, grow, and adjust the way they cope with pain and crisis their whole lives. What works for us one day might not work the next—and that’s completely okay! You are not alone. If you ever want help because you think you might hurt yourself, please call the Trevor Lifeline – it’s available 24/7 at 1-866-488-7386. Question 4: I feel super alone with all of this. Who can I trust to help me? Answer: It can be very difficult to stop cutting, especially when you feel like you are going through all of this alone. It’s important to find someone who is understanding and can listen to what you’re going through. Is there an adult in your life with whom you feel like you connect? It might be a teacher, family member, or someone in another area of your life, like a faith leader. Many people find that having a safe space to talk about their feelings can help them work through some of the reasons why they choose to self-harm. If you think that speaking to someone might help you fight the urge to cut, or if you are ever feeling like you might hurt yourself, turn to LGBTQ+ self-harm resources such as The Trevor Project’s 24-hour Lifeline at 1-866-488-7386.

Supporting LGBTQ+ Young People with Disabilities [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.thetrevorproject.org/resources/guide/supporting-lgbtq-young-people-with-disabilities/)

> Youth's Lives Every Day Disabled people are part of the LGBTQ+ community. Because of the intersections of their identities, LGBTQ+ young people with disabilities have distinct lived experiences. However, there is very little information available about how to support LGBTQ+ young people with disabilities. This guide will help inform you on how to best support the LGBTQ+ young people in your life with disabilities and better understand the things that impact them. The guide includes: Some of the various identities within the disability community - Recognizing the intersectional identity of being LGBTQ+ and disabled - The significance of person-first and identity-first language - Ableism and internalized-ableism - How to be an ally to LGBTQ+ young people with disabilities - Learning is an ongoing experience, so it’s okay to acknowledge that you might not know some things, even after reading this guide. Part of being a good ally is continuing your education, and we’re happy to be part of that journey with you. How to Support LGBTQ+ Young People with Disabilities Discussing Disabilities First, let’s talk about what a disability is. A disability can be defined as a physical, mental, cognitive, or developmental condition that impairs, interferes with, or limits a person’s ability to engage in certain tasks or actions or participate in typical daily activities and interactions. But even this definition is limited. People can have physical, intellectual, sensory, mental health related, or other non-visible disabilities. People can have any number of combinations of these types of disabilities. People can be born with a disability or become disabled at any point in their lives. People can be diagnosed with a disability at birth, later in life, or self-diagnosed, and all are valid! Spectrum of Disability Identities Physical Disabilities Physical disabilities affect the body. Spina bifida, muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, and spinal cord injuries are all examples of physical disabilities. These disabilities impact activities of daily life like eating, getting dressed, going to the bathroom, and more. People with physical disabilities sometimes use mobility aids like wheelchairs, canes, and crutches. Physical disabilities can be progressive (symptoms become more severe over time) or static (they stay the same over time). Intellectual Disabilities Intellectual disabilities affect a person’s thinking. Some people call this kind of thinking neurodivergent (processing, thinking, or behaving differently than what is considered typical). Down syndrome, dyslexia/dyscalculia, ADHD, and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder are all examples of intellectual disabilities. Like all people with disabilities, with the right support, people with intellectual disabilities can lead full and independent lives. Sensory Disabilities Sensory disabilities can impact how a person perceives things. Autism, blindness, deafness, and sensory processing disorder are all examples of sensory disabilities. A person with a sensory disability can be extra sensitive to sensory input or need to seek extra sensory input. People with sensory disabilities might need breaks to regulate themselves. Mental Health Disabilities Mental health disabilities are conditions that affect a person’s mental health and emotions. Anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and PTSD are all examples of mental health disabilities. Due to the stigma surrounding mental health, people often find it hard to be taken seriously about their disability. Non-Visible Disabilities Non-visible disabilities is a catch-all phrase for disabilities that are not always able to be perceived just by looking at someone. Chronic pain, vision impairment, and learning disabilities are examples of disabilities that may be non-visible. It can be extremely difficult for people with these disabilities to have other people believe them. Also, getting diagnosed with a non-visible disability is often a challenge; many people have to resort to self-diagnosis. Self-Diagnosis Self-diagnosis can be an important part of affirming your experience and finding care, and it can be especially helpful when access to medical care is limited. Still, it is important to take caution on the internet and do as much research as possible, and remember that labels don’t always describe people’s lived experiences. Online Research Online Research can be a way to find terms that match your experiences, especially when access to medical care is limited. Remember to use caution with self-diagnosis, however. The internet and social media are not the same as a licensed physician, who is always the best person to confirm or provide treatment plans. Best Practices for Allyship Recognizing Intersectional Identities Can disabled people be LGBTQ+? Yes! An estimated 3 to 5 million LGBTQ+ people in the United States have disabilities! Disability does not dictate gender identity or sexual orientation, so disabled people have the same range of genders and sexualities as non-disabled people do. However, many disabled people are treated like children. Even when they are adults, their sexuality and gender are often not acknowledged or believed. Parents and caregivers may even ignore a person’s gender and sexuality. The Trevor Project publishes research on the mental health of LGBTQ+ young people across a variety of experiences, including the mental health of deaf LGBTQ+ youth, mental health among autistic LGBTQ+ youth, and more. We are committed to providing more resources and support for the LGBTQ+ disabled community and their allies. Using Person-First and Identity-First Language Language is important to any community. In the disabled community, there are two different ways you can identify people with disabilities: person-first or identity-first. An example of a person-first identity in a sentence would be “a person with a disability.” Putting the person first and then their disability emphasizes the person before their disability. Identity-first language says that having a disability is a part of who you are and should be treated as such. Just as we don’t say “a person with tallness,” people who use identity-first language believe we shouldn’t use the phrase “person with a disability” but instead “a disabled person.” You should always respect how people want to identify in terms of their disability. If you don’t know, defaulting to person-first language is a good idea. Just like in the LGBTQ+ community, the disabled community has reclaimed slurs like “cripple” and “spaz.” Reclaiming them gives power back to the disabled community. People who do not have disabilities should not use these terms. If you hear a disabled person refer to themselves as a cripple, spaz, or other slur, you should not correct them or say it is harmful to use those words. Recognizing Different Forms of Ableism Ableism is defined as discrimination or prejudice against individuals with disabilities. Like all forms of discrimination, there are covert and obvious types of ableism that disabled people have to deal with on a daily basis. A business that doesn’t have a ramp to get into their building is an obvious example of ableism. Other forms of ableism include bullying, physical harm, lack of compliance with disability laws like the Americans With Disabilities Act, and ableist microaggressions. Internalized-Ableism There is another kind of ableism: internalized ableism. This occurs when a disabled person accepts society’s negative attitudes toward disability. Internalized ableism can manifest as depression, self-hatred, and low self-esteem. Because of how our society thinks about people with disabilities, ableism has been internalized by a lot of people. Being an Ally to LGBTQ+ Young People with Disabilities The Necessity of Inclusivity It is very important to support and give resources to LGBTQ+ young people with disabilities because there is not a lot of information for them, leaving them feeling very alone. LGBTQ+ young people with disabilities face double discrimination because of the intersection of their identities, which can be exacerbated if they also hold other marginalized identities. It can be even harder to find affirmation from their parents and caregivers, which can leave them feeling very alone. Schools might not be the most affirming place for disabled LGBTQ+ young people. Many disabled students attend special education programs where resources about sexuality are lacking. Even when students attend mainstream schools, there is still little information available to them about disabilities and sexuality. Information about queer sexualities and disabilities is even more rare to find. On top of a lack of information, non-disabled peers often lack experience interacting with disabled people. Sadly, this can make disabled young people feel even more isolated. Starting a Dialogue So how do you act as a good ally to disabled LGBTQ+ young people? For starters, just talk to them. Just going up to a disabled person and talking with them can really break the ice. You might learn that you have a lot in common with each other. If you have an LGBTQ+ affirming club at your school but meetings are being held in a non-accessible room, advocate to have that changed to meet in an accessible room. Also, if this club does activities outside of school, you can advocate to make sure those are all accessible as well. You don’t have to immediately know what your peers’ accessibility needs are; you can just ask them! Disabled LGBTQ+ young people are just like you! If you take the time to get to know them, you will see how much you have in common with them.

The Mental Health and Well-Being of Multiracial LGBTQ Youth [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.thetrevorproject.org/research-briefs/the-mental-health-and-well-being-of-multiracial-lgbtq-youth-aug-2022/)

> Youth's Lives Every Day EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Multiracial youth are the fastest-growing demographic in the United States (Jones et al., 2021); however, minimal research specifically explores multiracial youthâs mental health and well-being. Even less research explores the intersection of multiracial and LGBTQ identities, particularly among youth. The unique convergence of stressors experienced by holding a multiracial identity and an LGBTQ identity might make them more susceptible to negative experiences, and as a result, poorer mental health and well-being. This report is the first of its kind to explore the mental health and well-being of LGBTQ youth who are multiracial and provide within-group findings among multiracial LGBTQ youth to highlight different experiences among multiracial LGBTQ youth. This report uses data from a national sample of over 4,700 multiracial LGBTQ youth (14.6%) ages 13â24 who participated in The Trevor Projectâs 2022 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health. Multiracial LGBTQ youth are diverse in their racial, sexual, and gender identities. 75% of multiracial LGBTQ youth identified with two races/ethnicities, and 25% with more than two - Multiracial LGBTQ youth were more concentrated in the Western part of the U.S., compared to the overall LGBTQ youth sample - 30% of multiracial LGBTQ youth were bisexual, 22% gay or lesbian, 21% pansexual, 12% queer, 10% asexual, and 1% straight - 57% of multiracial LGBTQ youth identified as transgender or nonbinary, compared to 51% of the overall LGBTQ youth sample - Multiracial LGBTQ youth report higher rates of mental health challenges compared to monoracial LGBTQ youth. 48% of multiracial LGBTQ youth reported seriously considering suicide in the past year, including 55% of multiracial transgender and nonbinary youth - 17% of multiracial LGBTQ youth attempted suicide in the past year, including 22% of multiracial transgender and nonbinary youth - 75% of multiracial LGBTQ youth reported symptoms of anxiety in the past two weeks - 60% of multiracial LGBTQ youth reported symptoms of depression in the past two weeks - Multiracial LGBTQ youth who are exclusively youth of color reported higher rates of symptoms of depression, seriously considering suicide, and attempting suicide compared to multiracial LGBTQ youth who are White and another race/ethnicity - Multiracial LGBTQ youth experience higher rates of risk factors for suicide compared to monoracial LGBTQ youth. 31% of multiracial LGBTQ youth have ever experienced homelessness, been kicked out, or run away - 31% of multiracial LGBTQ youth have experienced food insecurity in the past month - 39% of multiracial LGBTQ youth have experienced discrimination based on their race/ethnicity in the past year - 77% of multiracial LGBTQ youth have ever experienced discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity - 35% of multiracial LGBTQ youth have ever been physically threatened or harmed due to their sexual orientation - 40% of multiracial transgender and nonbinary youth have ever been physically threatened or harmed due to their gender identity - LGBTQ-affirming spaces and people are strong protective factors for multiracial LGBTQ youth suicide. Multiracial LGBTQ youth who reported high levels of social support from family had 55% lower odds of attempting suicide in the past year - Multiracial LGBTQ youth with high social support from friends reported lower rates of attempted suicide in the past year compared to multiracial LGBTQ youth without it - Multiracial LGBTQ youth who attend LGBTQ-affirming schools had a 33% lower odds of attempting suicide in the past year - Methodology Summary A quantitative cross-sectional design was used to collect data using an online survey platform between September and December 2021. An analytic sample of nearly 34,000 youth ages 13â24 who resided in the United States was recruited via targeted ads on social media. All youth respondents were asked, âWhat best describes your race or ethnicity?â with options: Asian/Asian American, Black/African American, Hispanic or Latino/Latinx, more than one race or ethnicity, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian, White/Caucasian, and another race or ethnicity (please specify). Youth who selected more than one race or ethnicity were asked a follow-up question where they were able to select with which races or ethnicities they identified. The current analyses include the 4,739 LGBTQ youth who selected more than one race or ethnicity, henceforth referred to as multiracial. While we understand that definitions can vary given the social constructs of both race and ethnicity, in this report, we refer to multiracial youth as youth with parents from different racial and/or ethnic backgrounds. Recommendations The issues faced by multiracial LGBTQ youth are stark and underreported. Multiracial LGBTQ youth report rates of mental health challenges that are higher than monoracial LGBTQ youth. Unsurprisingly, multiracial LGBTQ youth also report higher rates of many risk factors for poor mental health compared to monoracial LGBTQ youth. Multiracial LGBTQ youth who are exclusively youth of color were particularly vulnerable, highlighting the potential role of racism in poor mental health among youth of color. Researchers and stakeholders must do more to examine and dismantle systematic racism and to prioritize the well-being of multiracial LGBTQ youth in order to inform best practices for working with this population and to improve outcomes. Youth-serving organizations must create supportive and accepting environments where multiracial identities are validated and LGBTQ identities are affirmed. BACKGROUND Research consistently finds that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth face higher rates of poor mental health compared to their straight and cisgender peers. LGBTQ youth report higher rates of anxiety and depression and are also more likely to engage in self-harm, seriously consider suicide, and attempt suicide when compared to straight, cisgender youth (Johns et al., 2020). These higher rates are not due to being LGBTQ in and of itself, but are instead due to chronic stress stemming from negative experiences associated with having a marginalized social status in society (Meyer, 2003). LGBTQ youth often face stressors such as rejection, victimization, bullying, and discrimination (Kosciw et al., 2018), in addition to common stressors faced by most youth, which can then lead to internalized homophobia, perceived burdensomenessâbelief that other would be better off if they were goneâ(Baams et al., 2015), and poor mental health. That said, important differences exist among LGBTQ youth, particularly among LGBTQ youth who hold multiple marginalized identities. For example, research finds that transgender and nonbinary youth report rates of poor mental health outcomes that are not only higher than cisgender youth (Johns et al., 2019), but higher when compared to cisgender LGBQ youth as well (Price-Feeney et al., 2020), as do youth who are bisexual or multisexual (Price et al., 2021). Important intersectional differences also exist among LGBTQ youth who hold multiple marginalized identities, such as youth who are multiracial and LGBTQ, which can increase their risk for poor mental health. Multiracial youth may face unique experiences and challenges that put them at increased risk for psychological distress. Multiracial youth have experiences with parents from different backgrounds, such as language, customs, worldviews, and life experiences, and have to navigate those as well as interactions with extended family members. This can contribute to learning early on how to navigate a wider range of diverse individuals or circumstances compared to monoracial youth, or youth whose parents are of the same racial/ethnic background (Nishina & Witkow, 2020). However, multiracial youth rarely find themselves in situations where they are the majority, and there are no official U.S. cultural events or holidays that celebrate multiracial identities and individuals. Though there have been recent improvements, because multiracial public figures are often assumed to be or are absorbed into broader monoracial groups, there is often a lack of multiracial role models for youth (Shih & Sanchez, 2005). Additionally, multiracial individuals report unique experiences with marginalization due to societyâs emphasis on rigid racial categories, which may cause others to express confusion about their race/ethnicity, and not be fully embraced by any particular racial group (Navarrete & Jenkins, 2011). Multiracial individuals may experience pressure, both internal and external from others, to choose one part of their background with which to identify (Herman, 2004). Therefore, unlike monoracial youth, multiracial youth have the added task and potential stressor of integrating multiple identities. Otherwise known as multiracial identity invalidation, having oneâs racial identity be invalidated by others can lead to multiracial individuals feeling disconnected from communities that may be important to them and influence mental health (Franco & OâBrien, 2018; Rockquemore et al., 2009). Finally, multiracial youth still have to contend with negative experiences due to their race/ethnicity like other monoracial youth of color in the U.S. (Samuels, 2014). The stressors experienced at the intersection of a multiracial identity and an LGBTQ identity might even further increase the risk for poor mental health challenges. An intersectional perspective suggests that a personâs position or social location in society, based on social demographics such as race, gender, class, sexual orientation, and ability, among others, affords unique experiences for people, particularly those with multiple marginalized identities (Collins & Bilge, 2020). The unique intersectionality of multiracial people who are LGBTQ is rarely addressed in research. However, those that have explored this intersectionality in research have found that multiracial LGBTQ people are subjected to both rejection and invisibility within their racial communities (Navarrete & Jenkins, 2011) and racism and mistreatment by the LGBTQ community (Elkhadem & Smith, 2016), which may create an added barrier to finding connectivity and support in the LGBTQ community (Felipe et al., 2022). As such, multiracial LGB people report higher rates of depression, self-harm, considering suicide, and suicide attempts compared to multiracial straight people, and higher rates of self-harm and suicide attempts compared to non-Hispanic White LGB people (Lytle et al., 2014). Even less research examines the specific experiences of multiracial LGBTQ youth, often only including them in the context of research on other LGBTQ youth. For example, a study of microaggressions among high school students found that both Black and multiracial LGBTQ students reported more race-based experiences of microaggressions than their straight peers (Banks et al., 2022). Additionally, in GLSENâs series, âErasure and resilience: The experiences of LGBTQ students of color,â the researchers often aggregated their analyses by monoracial youth and multiracial youth, providing insight into how they compare. For example, multiracial AAPI LGBTQ students reported having fewer supportive staff, more victimization based on sexual orientation and gender identity, more in-school discipline, and higher severity of racist victimization compared to exclusively AAPI LGBTQ students (Truong et al., 2020). Primarily due to White privilege and a youthâs proximity and access to it, the experiences of all multiracial LGBTQ youth may not be the same. Race continues to be a significant and well-documented factor in determining inequity in the United States, with institutional and structural racism disproportionately impacting people of color (Ladson-Billings & Tate IV, 1995). In this sense, there are political, economic, legal, political, and psychological advantages to being White, termed White privilege (Blacksher & Valles, 2021). The tenants of both of these argue that while people who are White may experience hardships, they do not encounter the additional hardships experienced by people of color due to societal racial bias. Using this argument, it could be presumed that all multiracial youthâs experiences in society may not be the same. In fact, youth who are able to access White privilege, perhaps by having a White parent or by being perceived as being exclusively White, may benefit from racialized social systems while multiracial youth who are exclusively youth of color may not. While very little research specifically explores this, one study found that LGBTQ youth who identified as Native and White were least likely to feel unsafe about their race/ethnicity at school, followed by those who identified exclusively as Native, with other Native multiracial LGBTQ students feeling most unsafe regarding their race/ethnicity at school (Zongrone et al., 2020). The authors suggested this was perhaps because of their perception by others as being a person of color. Research has failed to consider the mental health and well-being of multiracial LGBTQ youth and how they might experience various risk and protective factors. Often citing sample size, quantitative research on the experiences of LGBTQ youth frequently fails to explore the specific experiences of many groups who are smaller in size, such as multiracial youth. Furthermore, research on multiracial youth often does not consider how sexual orientation and gender identity may influence their findings or insights (Nishina & Witkow, 2020), leaving multiracial LGBTQ youth’s mental health dramatically unaddressed in research. Therefore, little is known about multiracial LGBTQ youth, let alone their mental health and well-being, and as such, their specific needs are unknown and often overlooked. This report is the first to exclusively study LGBTQ youth who are multiracial by describing the mental health and well-being of a national U.S. sample of over 4,700 multiracial LGBTQ youth ages 13â24 who participated in our 2022 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health. METHODOLOGY A quantitative cross-sectional design was used to collect data through an online survey platform between September and December 2021. A sample of LGBTQ youth ages 13â24 who resided in the United States was recruited via targeted ads on social media. The final analytic sample consisted of 33,993 LGBTQ youth. In the survey, all youth were asked, âWhat best describes your race or ethnicity?â with options: Asian/Asian American, Black/African American, Hispanic or Latino/Latinx, more than one race or ethnicity, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian, White/Caucasian, and another race or ethnicity (please specify). Youth who selected more than one race or ethnicity were asked a follow-up question to select with which races or ethnicities they identified. The current analyses include the 4,739 LGBTQ youth who selected more than one race or ethnicity, henceforth referred to as multiracial. While we understand that definitions can vary given the social constructs of both race and ethnicity, in this report, we refer to multiracial youth as youth with parents from different racial and/or ethnic backgrounds. The overall survey included a maximum of 150 questions, including questions on considering and attempting suicide in the past 12 months taken from the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionâs Youth Risk Behavior Survey (Johns et al., 2020) and measures of anxiety and depression based on the GAD-2 and PHQ-2, respectively (Plummer et al., 2016; Richardson et al., 2010). Each analysis was run separately for multiracial youth who identified as White and another race/ethnicity (83%) compared to youth who are exclusively multiracial youth of color to explore within-group differences. Logistic regression models were used to predict attempting suicide in the past year, adjusting for sex assigned at birth, age, gender identity, and sexual orientation. RESULTS Diversity Among Multiracial LGBTQ Youth Race, Ethnicity, Immigration, and Location Multiraciality is a pan-ethnic and broad category that encompasses many different groups with different cultures and experiences, and the multiracial LGBTQ youth in our sample represented many of those. In our sample, 75% of multiracial LGBTQ youth identified with two races/ethnicities, and 25% identified with more than two (see sample demographics on Page 29). Among youth who selected two race/ethnicities, the most endorsed were 32% who identified as Latinx and White, 22% as Asian American/Pacific Islander and White, 16% as Black and White, 11% as Native and White, 7% as Middle Eastern/Northern African and White, and 4% as Black and Latinx. Overall, 83% of multiracial LGBTQ youth identified as White multiracial (White and one or more additional races or ethnicities), and 17% identified as exclusively multiracial youth of color. Overall, 6% of multiracial LGBTQ youth reported being born outside of the U.S. This compares to 7% of the overall sample of LGBTQ youth. Additionally, 36% of multiracial LGBTQ youth reported that their parents were born outside of the U.S., compared to 27% of the overall LGBTQ youth sample. The vast majority of multiracial LGBTQ youth in our sample reported primarily speaking English at home (95%). Multiracial LGBTQ youth were equally located in both the southern (34%) and western (33%) regions of the U.S., followed by the Midwest (19%) and northeastern U.S. (14%). While the proportion in the South is similar (35%), the overall LGBTQ youth sample had higher representation in the Midwest (23%) and Northeast (16%), and less in the West (27%). Sexual Orientation Mirroring the sexual orientations of the overall LGBTQ youth sample, the most frequent sexual orientation among multiracial LGBTQ youth was bisexual (30%), followed by over one in five multiracial LGBTQ youth (22%) who identified as gay or lesbian. An additional 22% of multiracial LGBTQ youth identified as pansexual, 12% as queer, 9% asexual, 1% as straight, and 4% were unsure of their sexual orientation. Gender Identity and Expression In our sample, 57% of multiracial LGBTQ youth identified as transgender or nonbinary. Multiracial LGBTQ youth who are White and another race/ethnicity reported lower rates of being transgender or nonbinary (56%) compared to multiracial LGBTQ who are exclusively youth of color (61%). Additionally, 59% of the multiracial LGBTQ youth in our sample used pronouns or pronoun combinations that fell outside of the binary construction of gender, such as they/them exclusively or a combination of they/them and she/her or he/him. In contrast to sexual identity, rates of multiracial youthâs gender identities and expression differed compared to that of the overall sample of LGBTQ youth, 51% of whom were transgender or nonbinary, and 54% of whom used pronouns that fell outside of the binary construction of gender. Mental Health and Well-Being Among Multiracial LGBTQ Youth Anxiety and Depression Multiracial LGBTQ youth reported rates of anxiety and depression that were higher than those reported by monoracial LGBTQ youth. Three out of four multiracial LGBTQ youth reported symptoms of anxiety in the past two weeks (75%). This compares to 72% of monoracial LGBTQ youth. See Table 2 (page 30) for how rates differed for multiracial transgender and nonbinary youth compared to cisgender multiracial LGBTQ youth, multiracial youth aged 13â17 compared to multiracial youth aged 18â24, and multiracial LGBTQ youth who are White and another race/ethnicity compared to multiracial LGBTQ who are exclusively youth of color. Overall, three in five multiracial LGBTQ youth reported symptoms of depression in the past two weeks (60%). Similar to anxiety, depression symptoms were higher among multiracial LGBTQ youth compared to monoracial LGBTQ youth (57%), and within-group differences can be found in Table 2 (page 30). However, multiracial LGBTQ youth who are exclusively youth of color (66%) reported higher rates of symptoms of depression compared to multiracial LGBTQ youth who are White and another race/ethnicity (59%). Self-Harm and Suicide Risk Self-harm, also termed nonsuicidal self-injury or hurting oneâs self on purpose, in the past year was reported by 63% of multiracial LGBTQ youth. This compares to 56% of LGBTQ youth who were monoracial. Furthermore, there were significant disparities by age and gender identity, with multiracial youth ages 13â17 and transgender and nonbinary youth reporting higher rates of self-harm compared to multiracial youth aged 18â24 and cisgender (Table 2). Multiracial LGBTQ youth reported higher rates of suicide risk compared to monoracial LGBTQ youth. Nearly half (48%) of multiracial LGBTQ youth seriously considered suicide in the past year, which was higher when compared to monoracial LGBTQ youth (44%). Additionally, 17% of multiracial LGBTQ youth attempted suicide in the past year, compared to 14% of monoracial LGBTQ youth. Multiracial LGBTQ youth who are exclusively youth of color reported higher rates of both seriously considering (52%) and attempting suicide (21%) in the past year compared to multiracial LGBTQ youth who are White and another race/ethnicity (Table 2). It is important to note that, likely due to the complexities of race and stigma in the U.S., there are important differences even within multiracial youth who are White and another race/ethnicity, with LGBTQ youth who were Native and White often reporting significantly higher rates of nearly all mental health indicators and Asian American/Pacific Islander and White reporting the lowest. Access to Mental Health Care In spite of the rates of mental health concerns that are higher than monoracial LGBTQ youth, multiracial LGBTQ youth reported the same rates of experiencing barriers to access to wanted mental health care as their monoracial LGBTQ peers. Indeed, 60% of multiracial LGBTQ youth who wanted mental health care were not able to get it, matching the rate among the full sample. Half of multiracial LGBTQ youth (50%) reported wanting psychological or emotional counseling but were unable to receive it in the past 12 months compared to 33% of multiracial LGBTQ youth who wanted it and received it. Among multiracial youth, 54% of multiracial LGBTQ youth who are exclusively youth of color reported wanting psychological or emotional counseling but being unable to receive it in the past year, despite reporting higher rates of nearly all mental health outcomes â in comparison to 49% of multiracial LGBTQ youth who are White and another race/ethnicity. This finding further highlights the important disparities that can exist within this group. Multiracial LGBTQ youth reported similar barriers to access to mental health as the rest of the LGBTQ youth sample, with nearly half citing that they were afraid to talk about their mental health concerns with someone else (50%). Youth also reported that they did not want to get their parentâs/caregiverâs permission (46%), were afraid they wouldnât be taken seriously (45%), could not afford it (42%), and that they were afraid it wouldnât work (36%). Transgender and nonbinary multiracial youth reported significantly higher levels of nearly every barrier to mental health care compared to their multiracial cisgender peers. Risk Factors for Suicide Among Multiracial LGBTQ Youth Conversion Therapy Conversion therapy â attempts by licensed professionals (e.g., psychologists or counselors) or practices by religious leaders to alter sexual attractions and behaviors, gender expression, or gender identity â is still occurring despite a lack of evidence to support this practice and, conversely, mounting evidence illustrating associated harm (Green et al., 2020). Seven percent (7%) of multiracial LGBTQ youth reported having been exposed to conversion therapy, compared to 6% of the full sample of LGBTQ youth. An additional 12% of multiracial LGBTQ youth reported having been threatened with conversion therapy, compared to 11% of the full sample. Within multiracial LGBTQ youth, rates of having been exposed to conversion therapy were higher among multiracial LGBTQ youth ages 18â24 and those who were transgender or nonbinary (Table 3), however, rates did not differ significantly between multiracial LGBTQ youth who are White and another race/ethnicity and multiracial youth who are exclusively youth of color. Nearly all multiracial LGBTQ youth (94%) who were subjected to conversion therapy reported that it occurred when they were younger than 18. Given that this is a form of rejection for youth, multiracial LGBTQ youth who were subjected to conversion therapy had three times greater odds of attempting suicide in the past year (aOR = 3.16) compared to multiracial LGBTQ youth who were not. Itâs also important to note that even multiracial LGBTQ youth who were threatened with conversion therapy reported higher rates of suicide attempts in the past year (31%) compared to youth who had never been threatened with nor undergone conversion therapy (13%). Broader than conversion therapy, though certainly inclusive of it, are any attempts by someone to convince a young person to change their sexual orientation and gender identity. Despite what those who are doing this to youth may feel or their motivation for doing so, attempting to convince youth to change who they are is incredibly unsupportive and carries a potential for mental health risks. Nearly two out of three multiracial LGBTQ youth (65%) reported that someone attempted to convince them to change their sexual orientation or gender identity, compared to 61% of monoracial LGBTQ youth. The majority of these attempts came from parents (39%) and non-LGBTQ friends (30%). While the rate for change attempts by a parent or caregiver was similar to what is reported by the full sample of LGBTQ youth (38%), multiracial LGBTQ youth experienced higher rates of change attempts from non-LGBTQ friends compared to the full sample (27%). Multiracial LGBTQ youth who reported that someone tried to convince them to change their sexual orientation or gender identity reported nearly three times the rate of suicide attempts (22%) compared to multiracial LGBTQ youth who did not report that this happened (8%). Housing Instability and Food Insecurity Economic stability is one of the five social determinants of health outlined by the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP) (ODPHP, 2020) and includes both housing stability and food security, illustrating the critical impact that they have on overall well-being. Among multiracial LGBTQ youth, 31% experienced homelessness, had been kicked out, or had run away compared to 23% of monoracial LGBTQ youth. Similar to other findings, multiracial youth who were transgender or nonbinary reported higher rates compared to those who were cisgender (Table 3a, page 31), as did those who were multiracial youth of color compared to multiracial youth who are White and another race/ethnicity. Contrary to other findings, multiracial youth aged 18â24, whose parents have fewer legal consequences for kicking them out, reported higher rates of housing instability. Furthermore, 27% of LGBTQ youth who had experienced housing instability reported a suicide attempt in the past year compared to 13% who did not. Youth who reported being kicked out or that they ran away were asked a follow-up question about whether it was due to their LGBTQ identity. Among youth who were kicked out, 37% of multiracial LGBTQ youth reported having been kicked out or abandoned due to their LGBTQ identity, compared to 42% of the overall sample. Additionally, among youth who ran away, 52% of multiracial LGBTQ reported they ran away because of mistreatment due to their LGBTQ identity, compared to 55% among the full sample of LGBTQ youth. Having been kicked out or abandoned or run away due to their LGBTQ identity were both reported more frequently among multiracial transgender and nonbinary youth (Table 3a). An important, but often overlooked, aspect of housing instability is youth involvement in foster care. Overall, 7% of multiracial LGBTQ youth had ever been in foster care, which was significantly higher than the rate of monoracial LGBTQ youth involvement in foster care (4%). Nearly one in three multiracial LGBTQ youth who were ever involved in foster care reported a suicide attempt in the past month (32%), compared to 16% of multiracial who were never involved in foster care. Food insecurity, which is defined as the disruption of food intake or eating patterns because of a lack of money and other resources (Yousefi-Rizi et al., 2021), was reported by 31% of multiracial LGBTQ youth. While this rate was already higher than that reported by monoracial LGBTQ youth (27%), rates of food insecurity were even higher among multiracial transgender and nonbinary youth (37%) and multiracial LGBTQ youth who are exclusively youth of color (37%), compared to cisgender (23%) and multiracial LGBTQ youth who are White and another race/ethnicity (30%). This further illustrates the nuances of structural barriers and systemic oppression even among multiracial youth. Discrimination Based on Multiple Identities Due to holding many marginalized identities, multiracial LGBTQ youth are susceptible to experiencing discrimination and victimization based on several identities including, but not limited to, race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual identity, and immigration status. All youth in our sample were asked if they had ever experienced discrimination based on their actual or perceived status in several different identities. In our sample of multiracial LGBTQ youth, 39% reported discrimination based on their race/ethnicity in the past year. This compares to 23% of the full sample of LGBTQ youth and 47% of monoracial LGBTQ youth of color. Three out of five (60%) multiracial LGBTQ youth reported discrimination based on their sexual orientation in the past year. Additionally, half of multiracial LGBTQ youth reported discrimination based on their gender expression (51%), and 70% of multiracial transgender and nonbinary youth reported past-year discrimination based on their gender identity. Finally, 6% of multiracial LGBTQ youth reported having been discriminated against based on their immigration status. All of these rates of discrimination were higher than those reported by the overall LGBTQ youth sample. There were also important differences among multiracial LGBTQ youth (Table 3b, page 32). Multiracial LGBTQ youth who are exclusively youth of color reported higher rates of race/ethnicity-based discrimination (55%) compared to multiracial LGBTQ youth who are White and another race/ethnicity (37%). Multiracial youth who are exclusively youth of color also reported higher rates of discrimination based on their gender expression (56%) and immigration status (12%) compared to multiracial LGBTQ youth who are White and another race/ethnicity. Given our sample of LGBTQ youth, we further explored the impact of discrimination based on either oneâs sexual orientation or gender identity. The majority of multiracial LGBTQ youth reported discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity in the past year (77%) as did 73% of the full sample of LGBTQ youth. Multiracial LGBTQ youth who experienced discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity reported three times the rate of suicide attempts in the past year (21%) compared to multiracial LGBTQ youth who did not (7%). Victimization Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Overall, 40% of multiracial LGBTQ youth reported having been physically threatened or harmed due to their sexual orientation or gender identity in the past year, a higher rate compared to that of the full LGBTQ youth sample (36%). This includes 40% of multiracial transgender and nonbinary youth who were physically threatened or harmed based on their gender identity, and 35% of multiracial LGBTQ youth who were physically threatened or harmed based on their sexual orientation. Multiracial LGBTQ youth who are exclusively youth of color reported higher rates of having been physically threatened or harmed due to their sexual orientation (38%) compared to multiracial LGBTQ youth who are White and another race/ethnicity (34%). More comparisons among multiracial LGBTQ youth can be seen in Table 3b. Multiracial LGBTQ youth who had been physically threatened or harmed based on their sexual orientation or gender identity reported nearly three times the rate of past-year suicide attempts (28%) compared to multiracial LGBTQ youth who had not (10%). Suicide Protective Factors for Multiracial LGBTQ Youth Supportive People Having supportive people in their lives was protective for multiracial LGBTQ youth. Social support could be viewed as feeling like oneâs family members and friends are there for them when needed or trying to help them when they have troubles. Multiracial LGBTQ youth who reported high levels of family social support had 55% lower odds of attempting suicide in the past year (aOR = .45) compared to multiracial LGBTQ youth who did not have high family social support. Moreover, multiracial LGBTQ youth who reported high levels of social support from friends had 39% lower odds of attempting suicide in the past year (aOR = .61) compared to multiracial LGBTQ youth who did not have high social support from friends. That said, only one in five multiracial LGBTQ youth (20%) reported having high levels of social support from family, which is lower than that of the monoracial LGBTQ sample (22%, Table 4). Even fewer multiracial LGBTQ youth who are exclusively youth of color (13%), multiracial LGBTQ youth ages 13â17 (16%), and transgender and nonbinary multiracial youth (15%), reported high levels of family social support. While high social support from friends was more frequently reported among multiracial LGBTQ youth (73%) compared to high family support, this was still at a lower rate than that reported by monoracial LGBTQ youth (75%). The only difference in social support from friends among multiracial LGBTQ youth was that it was higher among transgender and nonbinary multiracial youth (75%) compared to cisgender multiracial youth (71%). Affirming Spaces Being able to be in spaces that affirm their LGBTQ identity was also associated with lower rates of suicide attempts for multiracial LGBTQ youth. Overall, 57% of multiracial LGBTQ youth reported their school was LGBTQ-affirming, including 56% of multiracial LGBTQ youth ages 18-24 and 58% of multiracial LGBTQ youth ages 13â17. This rate was higher than what was reported by monoracial LGBTQ youth (55%). Multiracial LGBTQ youth who attended LGBTQ-affirming schools reported lower rates of suicide attempts in the past year (15%) compared to multiracial LGBTQ youth who did not attend LGBTQ-affirming schools (21%), with the overall finding that multiracial youth attending LGBTQ-affirming schools had a 33% lower odds of attempting suicide in the past year (aOR =.67) compared to multiracial LGBTQ who were not at LGBTQ-affirming schools. Multiracial LGBTQ youth who were in LGBTQ-affirming homes also reported a lower rate of suicide attempts in the past year (12%) compared to those whose homes were not LGBTQ-affirming (19%). That said, only 38% of multiracial LGBTQ youth lived in an LGBTQ-affirming home. Additionally, rates differed among multiracial youth, with less than one-third of younger multiracial youth (aged 13â17) who reported their home was LGBTQ-affirming (30%), and one-third of multiracial LGBTQ youth who are exclusively youth of color (33%). Overall, more multiracial LGBTQ youth reported that their schools were LGBTQ-affirming compared to having LGBTQ-affirming homes, suggesting schools play an important role in providing needed LGBTQ identity affirmation and support. While LGBTQ youth may find themselves in supportive homes and schools, overall community-level support can also impact their well-being in terms of how they and their family are treated outside of those environments, and what policies may be enacted. Indeed, multiracial LGBTQ youth who currently lived in communities that were very accepting of LGBTQ people reported lower rates of suicide attempts in the past year (9%) compared to multiracial LGBTQ youth who currently lived in very unaccepting communities (25%). While 64% of multiracial reported living in communities there were either very or somewhat accepting of LGBTQ people, of importance, multiracial LGBTQ youth who are White and another race/ethnicity reported higher rates of living in very or somewhat accepting communities (64%) compared to multiracial LGBTQ youth who are exclusively youth of color (61%). RECOMMENDATIONS Multiracial LGBTQ youth have a diversity of identities and experiences that should be acknowledged and validated. The current findings show that multiracial LGBTQ youth represent a diverse group of youth in their racial, sexual, and gender identities, as well as their experiences. Three out of four multiracial LGBTQ youth identified with two races/ethnicities and 25% with more than two, covering a vast array of racial, ethnic, immigrant, and linguistic experiences. Additionally, while multiracial LGBTQ youthâs sexual identities mirrored those of the overall LGBTQ sample, more multiracial LGBTQ youth identified as transgender or nonbinary and used pronouns that fell outside of the binary construction of gender. It is possible that multiracial youth who are already navigating the complexities of racial identity are more comfortable embracing more nuanced gender and sexual identities. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of purposefully validating multiracial LGBTQ youthâs intersection of racial/ethnic identities and LGBTQ identities in both data collection and youth-serving organizations. This specifically means assessing multiracial identities in such a way that allows youth to respond that they have more than race/ethnicity, to be able to specify what those races/ethnicities are, and to leave multiracial as a racial/ethnic group in and of itself. Furthermore, creating affirming environments for multiracial youth also includes interpersonal interactions and proper training and education that address microaggressions specific to multiracial people and how to address them when youth may do them to one another. Finally, LGBTQ-serving organizations must acknowledge that all LGBTQ youthâs experiences are not the same, and there is value in understanding how to improve the well-being of all LGBTQ youth. The issues faced by multiracial LGBTQ youth are stark and demand attention from stakeholders. Multiracial LGBTQ youth report higher rates of symptoms of anxiety, symptoms of depression, and self-harm compared to monoracial LGBTQ youth. Multiracial LGBTQ youth also report 10% higher rates of considering suicide and nearly 30% higher rates of suicide attempts in the past year compared to monoracial LGBTQ youth. Additionally, multiracial LGBTQ youth are exposed to increased rates of risk factors for suicide such as discrimination, housing instability, food insecurity, and having been threatened or harmed due to their sexual orientation or gender identity when compared to our overall sample of LGBTQ youth. These findings overwhelmingly support greater investment in multiracial LGBTQ youth’s mental health through increased access to treatment and prevention programs that specifically affirm their racial identity and the nuances of navigating the world as a multiracial person. The experiences of multiracial LGBTQ youth are not monolithic and differences within the experiences of multiracial individuals should be taken into consideration when addressing multiracial LGBTQ youth’s mental health. Multiracial LGBTQ youth who are White and another race/ethnicity reported better mental health and well-being and fewer risks compared to multiracial LGBTQ youth who are exclusively youth of color. Despite these findings, multiracial LGBTQ youth who are exclusively youth of color reported lower access to the mental health care they wanted. These findings suggest that, as other researchers have also hypothesized, multiracial LGBTQ youth who are perceived by others as people of color may also be subjected to the same stigma and oppression as monoracial LGBTQ youth of color, whereas multiracial LGBTQ youth who are White and another race may have access to White privilege. While it is unclear if youth in our sample are being perceived by others as White or not, what is clear is that our findings point to the need to examine within-group differences among multiracial LGBTQ whenever possible. These findings also suggest that mental health interventions may need to be specifically targeted to address the needs of multicultural youth who are exclusively youth of color and the unique risk factors they may face, such as higher rates of racial discrimination, when considering how to ensure that they are salient for multiracial LGBTQ youth. Examining and dismantling systemic racism in our mental healthcare system (e.g., recruiting and retaining mental health practitioners from diverse and multiracial backgrounds), would also potentially address the disparities observed between multiracial LGBTQ youth who are White and another race/ethnicity and multiracial LGBTQ youth who are exclusively youth of color. The research community has failed to acknowledge the disparities of multiracial LGBTQ youth compared to monoracial LGBTQ youth. Researchers have historically failed to examine multiracial youthâs developmental outcomes as well as those of LGBTQ youth, leaving outcomes specific to multiracial LGBTQ youth at the intersection of these two identities starkly underreported. With multiracial LGBTQ results being left out of life-saving research, important resources are unable to be properly allocated to those most in need. With multicultural youth being one of the fastest-growing racial/ethnic identities in the U.S., the lack of available sample size is no longer a valid excuse for researchers to fail to separately report findings on multiracial LGBTQ youth. Researchers must make an effort to properly assess multiracial identities in order to facilitate proper data collection and analysis. The Trevor Project is committed to working toward improving and supporting the mental health and well-being of multiracial LGBTQ youth. Our crisis services are committed to ensuring that all LGBTQ youth, including those who are multiracial, are provided high-quality, culturally-validating care, and we have worked to create a team of diverse counselors that aligns with the demographics of the youth we serve. Our research team continues to be committed to the ongoing dissemination of findings specific to multiracial LGBTQ youth to support The Trevor Projectâs work to support all LGBTQ youth, as well as external partners and stakeholdersâ desire to better understand and address the needs of multiracial LGBTQ youth.

> Are open to new experiences and receiving feedback Have access to a private space for remote volunteering Interested in volunteering? Thank you for your interest in becoming a Volunteer Crisis Counselor with The Trevor Project! We are excited that you are interested in supporting our mission to end suicide among LGBTQ+ young people. At this time, we have an incredibly high volume of interest, and more applications in our queue than there are spaces in upcoming training classes. In order to ensure that new applicants can have a more streamlined experience, our general volunteer Crisis Counselor application is currently unavailable.

If you are interested in receiving an email from us when the application opens again, please fill out the Volunteer Crisis Counselor Interest Form. If you are a university student looking to complete a practicum as a volunteer Crisis Counselor for credit for your academic program, please complete our Contact Us form and select âUniversity Practicumâ for instructions and next steps. All other questions about volunteering can be directed to the Volunteer Recruitment team by completing the Contact Us form and selecting âVolunteering as a Crisis Counselor.â Reasons to volunteer We donât have to tell you that becoming a crisis counselor is a rewarding experience. But we will anyway. Supportive Community Network Gain â¨Important Soft Skills World-Class Crisis Intervention Training Volunteer FAQs What is the time commitment for volunteers? After completing a 40-hour training over the course of 8 weeks, volunteers must commit to a weekly 3-hour shift for a minimum of one year. What are the technical requirements for volunteers? To volunteer at Trevor, youâll need the right technology. Security, privacy, sound quality and a strong internet connection are all key elements to providing a safe and supportive experience for young people. Our technical requirements include: A personal laptop or desktop computer. Tablets, Chromebooks and cell phones are not permitted Access to a private space with a secure, private high-speed internet connection with no VPN An up-to-date operating system (such as Windows 10, MacOS Ventura, Big Sur, or Monterey, or the most recent Linux) The ability to download the latest version of Google Chrome A minimum of 5Mbps download speed, 2Mbps upload speed and an Octane score of over 30,000. You can measure your internet speedÂ hereÂ and measure your Octane scoreÂ here. Read more about all of our technology requirements here. What is the training like? Our online training consists of 40+ hours of combined lesson and practice content, with self-paced modules covering counseling skills, LGBTQ+ identities, our Support Model (the framework for all conversations on our crisis services platform), and relevant policies, procedures, and protocols to prepare prospective volunteers to speak with youth in crisis. Trainees will also complete a number of scheduled role-plays to apply this training material and prepare for interactions with the young people and others who reach out to our service. If trainees complete their modules and pass their evaluated roleplays, they will move on to New Counselor Shifts (NCS). NCS are a counselorâs first, highly-monitored, conversations with real contacts, during which counselors receive extra support and feedback. Trainees who complete the counselor training program and adhere to Trevorâs Support Model are moved forward to become active counselors. Do I have to be available during specific days and times for training? Much of the training can be done at your own pace and convenience.Trainees are expected to spend around 5 hours each week to meet weekly training requirements that include the completion of training modules, practice activities, and assessments, designed to reinforce the knowledge taught in the training modules. Additionally, trainees will sign up for role-plays on specific dates and times over the course of the training, where they will apply attitudes and skills taught in training to practice scenarios. Learners who do not pass a given role-play will take an enrichment role-play the following week for additional practice. Role-play scheduling slots are available between 9:00 am ET – 9:00 pm ET most days, including weekends. While you can complete your modules on your own time, roleplays will only take place during the 9:00 am ET – 9:00 pm ET time range, and will require scheduling in advance. Role-plays may take place at different times than when your actual counselor shifts will take place once you complete training. If you anticipate that you will be on vacation or unavailable for more than a week during training or 3 months after training, please contact your Volunteer Recruiter to confirm if your start date is right for you. When do volunteer shifts take place? The Trevor Project runs 24/7 crisis services for LGBTQ+ young people. This means that volunteer shifts happen all day and all night. Upon graduation from training, volunteers work with our team to be placed onto 3-hour shifts that align with their schedule and our most pressing needs. What if I want to go on vacation or something comes up and I have to miss my shift? The Trevor Project has policies to manage shift cancellations and substitutions as they are needed. However, we limit the number of shift cancellations volunteers can take, and ask that volunteers plan ahead to ensure they are generally available for shifts. The Trevor Project requires a full-year commitment for crisis services (Chat/Text/Lifeline) volunteers and generally does not accept applicants who will be outside the country for an extended period of time. Can I volunteer from anywhere? All of our volunteer opportunities are remote. Volunteers may work from anywhere in the United States (50 states and the District of Columbia), as long as they have access to a personal desktop or laptop computer, a consistent and stable server, a private and secure internet connection and a private space to respond to young people. Please note that volunteers are not able to use a school or work laptop or a public wifi connection during their volunteer shifts. At this time we are only able to have volunteers fulfill their shifts while in the United States (50 states and the District of the Columbia only) due to our background check requirements and security protocols that ensure the safety of our youth. What support will I receive as a volunteer? During training you will have support from a Training Coordinator who will support you through role-plays, provide feedback, and answer questions throughout your journey. During New Counselor Shifts, you will be monitored by a Digital or Lifeline Supervisor for your first conversations with youth. Office hours are available for volunteers interested in one-on-one support and volunteers who would like to process difficult conversations that may arise during their shift. I don’t have experience in mental health counseling. Can I still become a crisis counselor? Yes! Our trainees undergo a 40-hour virtual training to prepare them extensively for the many potential scenarios that may emerge in conversations with LGBTQ youth in crisis. Do you accept clinical field placement / practicum students as volunteers? If you are interested in volunteering with The Trevor Project to gain hours for field placement or practicum, please Contact Us and select âUniversity Practicumâ on the form.Â Â If you are a representative from a university looking to build a field placement or practicum partnership with The Trevor Project for students in your program, please Contact Us and select âUniversity Practicumâ on the form to schedule an exploratory conversation. If you are looking for a paid position at Trevor, you can explore those on our Careers page. Do you verify volunteer hours for school or court-mandated service? For standard volunteers, we are able to provide a letter of service documenting volunteer hours to active volunteers who have successfully graduated from training. These are an approximation based on a volunteerâs schedule. We also can provide a standard letter of recommendation after six months of service, which does not speak to individual performance. Both of these should be requested at least three weeks in advance. Unfortunately, due to the volume of our volunteer base, we are not able to complete specific forms for school or court for standard volunteers at this time, unless you are part of a pre-approved clinical placement or practicum program with Trevor. If you are volunteering with The Trevor Project as part of an official clinical placement or practicum partnership, your hours will be verified as part of this program. If you need verified volunteer hours as part of a course or degree requirement, please Contact Us about University Practicum before you start volunteering. Do you have any other volunteer opportunities? At this time, our only volunteer opportunities are with our TrevorChat/TrevorText and TrevorLifeline programs. How can my company get involved with The Trevor Project? Please use our Contact Us page to connect with our corporate development team, who will be able to work with you to see how your team can best support our life-saving work. I am not able to volunteer my time. How else can I get involved? Host a Fundraiser: Have a birthday coming up? Want to raise money to support The Trevor Project? Learn how to host a successful fundraiser. Donate: Your life-saving gift can help us train a record number of crisis counselors, continue to provide all of our crisis services 24/7, and expand our advocacy efforts. I already submitted my application, but havenât heard anything. What should I do? Due to the volume of applications we receive each day, we are unable to provide updates on any individual application outside of confirming it was received. It can take several months from the time of submission for an application to be reviewed. Once you submit your application, no further action is needed from you. When we have reviewed your application, our Volunteer Recruitment team will notify you of our decision. There are other ways to help. Your donation will save lives. Every day, LGBTQ+ young people reach out for mental health support. When you donate to Trevor, you ensure our volunteers can continue to be there for them. Trevor Volunteer Crisis Counselors go through a 40-hour online training over the course of 10 weeks that covers counseling skills, LGBTQ identity, the structure of a conversation on our crisis services, and relevant policies, procedures and protocols to prepare them to speak with young people in crisis who reach out on our free, confidential, and secure 24/7 services.Â Young people reach out to The Trevor Project every day for a wide variety of reasons. Some young people are in moments of imminent risk of suicide; others just need someone to talk to.Â Serious topics including suicide, self-harm, eating disorders, addiction, abuse, sexual violence, bullying, depression and other mental health crises can come up in conversation. Our team will prepare volunteers for the many potential scenarios that may emerge in conversation. Our Crisis Services We offer two remote programs volunteers can choose from: TrevorLifeline (Phone): Lifeline Volunteer Counselors are trained to answer calls from LGBTQ young people who reach out to our 24/7 phone Lifeline when they are feeling suicidal or need a safe, non-judgmental place to talk. TrevorChat/TrevorText (Digital): Digital Volunteer Crisis Counselors are trained to answer chats and texts from LGBTQ young people who reach out about issues such as coming out, LGBTQ identity, depression, and suicide. Please note that our greatest need for volunteers is currently in our TrevorChat/TrevorText Digital program. Young people are close to twice as likely to reach out to Trevorâs service on our chat/text platform.
