The journal Child and Family Social Work published a scoping review examining existing research on child welfare services for LGBTQ youth, their caregivers, and foster parents. The researchers used the following two questions to guide their research: What is known about the practices of child welfare services toward LGBTQ youth and caregivers? - What is known about LGBTQ foster parents? - The experiences, prevalence, and outcomes of LGBTQ youth who come into contact with child welfare - The perspectives of LGBTQ foster parents and foster caregivers of youth in care who are LGBTQ - Child welfare practice in an LGBTQ perspective -
