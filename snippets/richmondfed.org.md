> Our News 6 Perfect Scores for LGBTQ+ Equality The Richmond Fed has been recognized as a “Best Place to Work” for the sixth consecutive year, scoring a perfect 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index Survey for 2022! The HRC annual survey benchmarks corporate policies and practices, and measures lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) equality within organizations. “This six-year streak is a direct result of the partnerships and inclusion of all members of our organization, including the leadership of our PRISM (Pride, Respect, Inclusion, Safe and Mutual respect) employee resource network,” shared Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion manager Beth Panilaitis. “Our intentional efforts to maintain our strong foundation of LGBTQ+ inclusion and continuous assessments of how we can improve has allowed us to keep building a culture of trust and equity among not only our LGBTQ+ community, but all employees.” With continued support from PRISM and other allies, we’ve made notable progress since our 2021 survey, including these accomplishments that contributed to our perfect score: Maintaining gender transition guidelines and an inclusive Equal Opportunity Employer policy - Offering LGBTQ+ education and awareness sessions for employees in our hybrid environment - Collaborating on transgender-inclusive benefits offered across the Federal Reserve System leading to the development of a pronoun knowledge resource and email signature pronoun field - Partnering with the LGBTQ+ community outside our Bank, including volunteering for Diversity Richmond and hosting a recruiting event for college students - “I love that valuing the diversity of individuals and embracing and respecting these differences is a core part of our Bank’s culture,” added PRISM ERN Chair Jim Ellis. “The HRC recognition is external acknowledgement of the continuing priority, progress and efforts to include LGBTQ+ employees as part of our great culture. Only the dedication and teamwork of leadership, PRISM members and community involvement have made this possible.” Explore the Working Here page to learn more about our commitment to diversity and inclusion at the Richmond Fed.
