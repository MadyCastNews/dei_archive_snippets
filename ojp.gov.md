Yet, decades later many Americans are still having to fight. According to an analysis of National Crime Victimization Survey data, in about 1 in 5 violent hate crime victimizations, victims believed the hate crime was motivated by bias against persons or groups they were associated with (23%) or by bias against their sexual orientation (20%). During Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex Pride Month, the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) joins President Biden in standing “with every LGBTQI+ American in the ongoing struggle against intolerance, discrimination, and injustice.” We are proud to contribute to this administration’s efforts to advance equity through important initiatives that protect the rights of victims who identify as LGBTQI+, and support them with trauma-informed, victim-centered services. One of the most vulnerable populations within the wider LGBTQI+ community is transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals, particularly transgender women and girls of color, who face epidemic levels of violence, discrimination, and stigma. One way we hope to better serve them is through the FY 2022 Responding to Transgender Victims of Crime solicitation. This solicitation will fund the creation of a toolkit that helps service providers improve their response to transgender victims through trauma-informed and culturally responsive approaches. This toolkit will update and expand upon the information contained in an existing OVC guide, with up-to-date definitions and understandings of the issues that transgender victims face. It will recognize, for instance, that violence aimed at transgender individuals may not only include sexual assault, but also harassment, physical assault, domestic violence, human trafficking, and other violent crimes. The Grants.gov deadline is this week—June 1, 2022. Other OVC FY 2022 solicitations can be leveraged to prioritize the safety and dignity of LGBTQI+ individuals within a larger project scope. For example, one of OVC’s FY 2022 field-generated solicitations will fund innovative approaches to increasing service options and expanding access for unheard and underrepresented communities, including the LGBTQI+ community. The Grants.gov deadline is June 28, 2022. View this solicitation and others on OVC’s website. These programs are consistent with my main priorities for OVC: to increase options and expand access for all victims of crime. This Pride Month, we ask you to join us as we remember the victims of these hate crimes and bias-motivated assaults and honor those who, in their efforts to protect and serve our most vulnerable communities, carry forward the legacy of Stonewall. Kristina Rose Director

This project will better equip CRCC to meet the needs of child sexual abuse victims and victims that are members of the LGBTQ+ community by increasing access, inclusivity, and innovation across Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake and Ashtabula Counties in Ohio. This project will allow CRCC to deliver on a focused strategic marketing effort to connect more survivors in marginalized communities across its footprint to services, support for a specifically located CRCC space to offer specialized programming, and ensuring existing spaces and functions have what they need to offer effective services and a safe, welcoming space to all – while also better serving children and families impacted by sexual violence. By improving CRCC’s capacity to reach and serve youth, families, and the LGBTQ+ community, this project will support CRCC’s capacity in serving all clients CRCC interacts with.

OVC recognizes the important role hospitals can play in combating violence and providing critical services to crime victims, particularly in communities of color. Visit the American Hospital Association website for information about this commemoration and to view a digital toolkit to help promote awareness. We encourage eligible applicants to apply for the OVC FY 2021 Advancing Hospital-Based Victim Services solicitation. Through this solicitation, OVC is seeking applications for funding to improve linkages between the victim services field and hospitals and other medical facilities that increase support for victims of crime, improve outcomes, and reduce chances of future victimization. - Step 1 Deadline in Grants.gov: 11:59 p.m. eastern time on Monday, June 28, 2021 - Step 2 Deadline in JustGrants: 11:59 p.m. eastern time on Monday, July 12, 2021 Learn more and apply for this funding opportunity. Also visit our Communities of Color topic page to discover more resources to help your organization identify, reach, and serve victims from underserved communities. World Elder Abuse Awareness Day is June 15 In the United States, an estimated 5 million older adults are abused, neglected, or exploited each year. Victims of elder abuse and exploitation are robbed of their homes, life savings, their dignity, their independence, and sometimes even their lives. In the World Elder Abuse Awareness Day proclamation, President Biden stated "we recommit ourselves to protecting every senior’s right to live their golden years with dignity and respect." OVC is working tirelessly to ensure that older victims of abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation are connected with trauma-informed services and resources that protect the safety and confidentiality of victims. Through the Crime Victims Fund—financed by fines and penalties paid by convicted federal offenders, not from tax dollars—OVC is supporting: - increased legal services for older victims of crime across the country, particularly in rural areas; - enhanced multidisciplinary teams to better identify and respond to cases of elder abuse and financial exploitation; - training, resources, and tools for state and local law enforcement partners to expand their capacity to effectively prevent and combat elder abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation; - state and local elder abuse programs; - evidence-based mental health interventions for older victims, who screen positive for depression, and telehealth services; and - the development of critical resources that help stakeholders identify, reach, and better serve older victims of crime. OVC also manages the U.S. Department of Justice National Elder Fraud Hotline (1–833–FRAUD–11). The hotline has experienced case managers standing by to provide victims of financial fraud aged 60 or older with personalized support by assessing their needs and identifying relevant next steps. You may incorporate digital artwork into your elder abuse awareness efforts to help raise awareness about this cause. Access OVC’s Elder Fraud and Abuse website for publications, resources, and training and technical assistance and OVC’s list of events for World Elder Abuse Awareness Day activities around the country of interest to those serving, supporting, and working with victims in their community. Visit the University of Southern California’s Center on Elder Mistreatment for tools and tips about raising awareness of elder abuse, such as outreach and social media guides, sample letters to the editor, downloadable fliers, and more. See a comprehensive roundup of OVC’s elder abuse publications and resources, and even more from the Department of Justice’s Elder Justice Initiative. June Is Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Pride Month President Biden proclaimed June as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Pride Month. In the White House proclamation, President Biden states “This Pride Month, we recognize the valuable contributions of LGBTQ+ individuals across America, and we reaffirm our commitment to standing in solidarity with LGBTQ+ Americans in their ongoing struggle against discrimination and injustice.” Crime victim services are not always readily accessible to or designed for victims, including individuals who identify as LGBTQ+. To help ensure that victim service providers have access to information to help them identify, reach, and serve all victims, OVC funded the creation of the National Resource Center for Reaching Victims. Visit the LGBTQ+ section of the Center’s Resource Library to discover best practices and contact the Center to learn about training and technical assistance opportunities. The OVC Training and Technical Assistance Center also offers several resources, including Serving LGBTQ Survivors of Violence training by request provides the knowledge and skills needed to effectively support and work with LGBTQ-identified people, communities, and survivors. The training will help participants strengthen their knowledge of the obstacles LGBTQ people experience in seeking victim services and explore how best to overcome or alleviate these obstacles. Learn more and apply for this training. OVC’s Responding to Transgender Victims of Sexual Assault e-publication offers practical tools to promote understanding and support of transgender victims who experience high rates of sexual violence. The guide contains a section titled, Transgender 101, which covers the basics of what it means to be transgender. If you need a general understanding of issues impacting the transgender community, this is an excellent place to build your cultural competency. Apply for OVC Funding Opportunities to Enhance Services for Victims of Crime OVC is seeking qualified applicants for multiple Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 discretionary grant funding opportunities.

The aim of the program is to enhance the provision of services and support to crime victims to further ensure that all victims are afforded the rights to which they are due. All initiatives are national in scope and focus on improving the capacity of victim service providers and allied practitioners in advancing rights and services for crime victims in the areas of child pornography; drunk and impaired driving; mortgage fraud; sexual assault within correctional settings; coordinated state-tribal crime victim services; long-term mental health and other consequences of mass violence; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer/questioning (LGBTQ) crime victims access to mainstream victim services; services for young male victims of color; or using technology to improve and enhance victim services. Beyond Diversity Resource Center, through a partnership with the School of Social Work (SSW) at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey will implement a demonstration project with six mainstream victim service providers from across the nation. The six agencies, which could include prosecutor's offices, juvenile justice agencies, police departments, anti-violence agencies, domestic violence programs, and government agencies dedicated to providing victim services, would be selected based on criteria essential to the demonstration project: (1) the agencies will represent diversity in geographic location, number of people served and staff size, and (2) a majority of the agencies will be located in regions where there are identifiable organizations that advocate for or address the needs of the LGBTQ community, and (3) a minority of the agencies will be located in regions where there are no identifiable LGBTQ advocate organizations. BDRC will implement organizational development strategies with the participating organizations, offer relevant diversity training, and develop organizational protocols in an effort to enhance LGBTQ victim services. A compendium of project research, organizational development interventions, and provider best practices will be developed for use by OVC. ca/ncf

King County Coalition Against Domestic Violence, through a partnership with the North West Network of Bisexual, Trans, Lesbian & Gay Survivors of Abuse (NW Network) will create a nationally replicable model to improve lesbian, bisexual, transgender, transsexual, gay and queer crime victims access to mainstream services. The project will build upon KCCADV's and NW Network's proven expertise mobilizing regional collaborations to improve service access, providing national training and technical assistance on LGBTQ issues and crime victimization, increasing LGBTQ cultural competency in service provision, and working with LGBTQ youth and adult victims of crime. Rather than working with solely with individual agencies, the proposal includes a "Regional Response Model" which will mobilize mainstream victim service programs throughout King County to work together to ensure broad and meaningful access to LGBTQ victims. The project will utilize: regional advisory board, annual training summits, in-depth technical assistance for pace-setter agencies, support 15-30 improvement sites to adopt specific access recommendations, regional response workgroups to develop practice and policy recommendations, policy advocacy through established crime-victim coalitions, and a compilation of a Regional Response National Replication Toolkit. ca/ncf

OVC Administers Grants that Support Millions of Victims Each Year The Crime Victims Fund is financed by fines and penalties paid by convicted federal offenders, not from tax dollars. Administered by OVC, the Crime Victims Fund provides support to state victim assistance and compensation programs annually. Annual Victim Assistance and Victim Compensation grants help fund thousands of local victim assistance programs nationwide and provide millions in victim compensation to victims of crime. In FY 2021, OVC awarded more than $1 billion in Victim Assistance grants that will support local direct service programs, including domestic violence shelters, rape crisis centers, human trafficking and elder abuse programs, as well as victim advocate positions in prosecutors’ offices and law enforcement departments. Through Victim Compensation grants, more than $186 million will supplement the state funds that assist victims’ with financial burdens such as medical fees, lost income, dependent care, funeral expenses, and other costs resulting from crime. OVC Victim Assistance and Victim Compensation grantees are also required to report performance measures. In FY 2019, the latest year for which reporting data is available, OVC provided $3.3 billion to 56 states and territories under the Victim Assistance Formula Grant program. These 56 grantees used this money to fund 6,837 domestic violence shelters, rape crisis centers, human trafficking and elder abuse programs, and other programs that provide direct services to victims of crime. Programs receiving funding in FY 2019 reported— serving more than 13.8 million total victims (including new and returning individuals) and - handling nearly 5 million hotline calls or online chats. - Read more in our FY 2019 Victim Assistance Formula Grant Program Nationwide Performance Report. In FY 2019, 54 states and territories received funding to reimburse victims for out-of-pocket expenses resulting from the crime. Programs receiving funding in FY 2019 reported reimbursing nearly $400 million to more than 235,000 victims of crime.

One in two transgender individuals are sexually abused or assaulted at some point in their lives.1 Some reports estimate that transgender survivors may experience rates of sexual assault up to 66 percent, often coupled with physical assaults or abuse.2 This indicates that the majority of transgender individuals are living with the aftermath of trauma and the fear of possible repeat victimization. This section covers statistics related to the following topics: Victims Sexual violence has been found to be even higher in some subpopulations within the transgender community, including transgender youth, transgender people of color, individuals living with disabilities, homeless individuals, and those who are involved in the sex trade. For example, the 2011 Injustice at Every Turn: A Report of the National Transgender Discrimination Survey found that 12 percent of transgender youth report being sexually assaulted in K12 settings by peers or educational staff; 13 percent of African-American transgender people surveyed were sexually assaulted in the workplace; and 22 percent of homeless transgender individuals were assaulted while staying in shelters.3 Perpetrators Sexual assaults can be perpetrated by any individual; however, it is particularly startling when professionals who are in "helping" roles abuse their power and sexually assault individuals they are supposed to be serving. Fifteen percent of transgender individuals report being sexually assaulted while in police custody or jail, which more than doubles (32 percent) for African-American transgender people. Five to nine percent of transgender survivors were sexually assaulted by police officers.4 Another 10 percent were assaulted by health care professionals.5 Hate crimes Sexual assault perpetrated against transgender individuals may be a component of an anti-transgender hate crime or may be linked to other demographic variables such as race. According to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP): In the NCAVP 2009 report on hate violence, 50 percent of people who died in violent hate crimes against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people were transgender women; the other half were male, many of whom were gender non-conforming.7 Sexual assault and/or genital mutilation before or after their murders was a frequent occurrence. In 2009, 17 percent of all reported violent hate crimes against LGBTQ people were directed against those who identified themselves as transgender, with most (11 percent of all hate crimes) identifying as transgender women.8 The remainder identified as transgender men, genderqueer, gender questioning, or intersex. Hate crimes are more prevalent against people of color. In 2009, 53 percent of LGBTQ hate crime victims were people of color.9 Of the 22 anti-LGBTQ hate crime murders documented by NCAVP that year, 79 percent of the victims were people of color.10 As noted above, 50 percent (11 individuals) of the 2009 murders tracked were transgender women; of those, 9 were people of color (82 percent). Of the other 11 murders of gender non-conforming people, 5 (45 percent) were people of color.11 Intimate partner violence Many incidents of intimate partner violence include some form of sexual assault.12 According to the 2010 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, "bisexual women experienced significantly higher lifetime prevalence of rape and other sexual violence by an intimate partner when compared to heterosexual women" and "significantly higher lifetime prevalence of rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner when compared to lesbian and heterosexual women."13 Some studies indicate that between 20 and 35 percent of LGBTQ couples experience domestic violence.14 According to another, 50 percent of transgender people surveyed had been hit by a primary partner after coming out as transgender.15 LGBTQ youth report a 30 percent incidence of dating violence, compared to 9 percent for heterosexual students.16 Only one in five LGBTQ victims of intimate partner violence or sexual assault get help from service providers.17 |

Abstract The study focused on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and youth questioning their sexual identity (LGBTQ); young men who have sex with men (YMSM); and young women who have sex with women (YWSW). All of the youth interviewed engaged in sex for money they needed to meet their basic survival needs ("survival sex"). The interviews were conducted by youth leaders trained to conduct in-depth interviews with youth engaged in survival sex. The interviews solicited information from the youth about their exposure to sexually transmitted diseases(STDs) and other health issues; the extent of substance abuse; and treatment and service-provider experiences. Seven key findings are reported. First, most youth reported using barrier and non-barrier protection, most often condoms, to protect against STDs and pregnancy. Second, medical providers were often the first professionals the youth sought for medical information and services. Third, 93 percent of the youth had visited one or more service providers. Fourth, although most youth had positive attitudes toward the programs and services they received, some reported feeling discrimination because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Fifth, of the 260 youth who sought services, 36 percent indicated their needs were fully met, but 64 percent expressed having needs that were not served.

Research on the consequences of hate crime victimization primarily focuses on adverse health and economic effects with limited attention devoted to the socio-behavioral impact of crime. Informed by Intersectionality Theory (Crenshaw, 1989) and relying on 400 in-person structured interviews with LGBTQ Latine immigrant victims of crime in Miami, this research finds that 23% of victims had to change housing, 13% began avoiding queer venues/friends, and 35% started acting stereotypically “straight” because of the crime. New immigrant victims were more likely to experience forced relocation due to crime. Victims were more likely to adopt heteronormative behavior/appearance as a result of victimization if they were non-Cuban-American, had higher income, and were more closeted. Findings suggest that coming out can be an important crime control strategy. The paper concludes with a discussion about the benefits and limitations of adopting the intersectionality perspective in quantitative research, and three-stage venue-based sampling used to recruit participants.

Klein, who discuss the higher risk of violence faced by LGBTQ students on college and university campuses, as well as the type of services such victims need. LGBTQ is an anacronym for individuals who identify as having a minority sexual orientation. The sexual orientations encompassed in LGBTQ include lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer. The current podcast uses the anacronym “LGBTQ+” to encompass anyone who perceives herself/himself as having a minority sexual orientation of some type. In discussing why LGBTQ individuals have a higher or distinctive risk for violent and abusive victimization, the discussion first focuses on the higher risk of experiencing abusive victimization by any person with a minority physical, belief, or behavioral characteristic. The discussion of the causes of increased risk of abusive victimization for LGBTQ+ students also addresses their increased risk for adverse coping behaviors, such as alcohol and drug use, due to their greater likelihood of having experienced abuse as children and youth because of their sexual orientation. Prevention efforts should focus on the responsible use of substances by students and respect for the safety of and intervention on behalf of the safety of all students, regardless of their characteristics. One of the members of the podcast describes how Rutgers University has customized its services for LGBTQ+ victims of violence and abuse, based on advice provided by LGBTQ advocacy and service groups.

Bystander intervention in campus sexual violence has received increased attention as a promising prevention strategy; however, research is limited regarding this type of intervention with racial and sexual minority students, such as students of color, LGBTQ-spectrum students, and the intersections thereof. Using concept mapping methodology, the current study was conducted in three phases: brainstorming of statements about bystander intervention, sorting and rating of statements, and mapping and interpretation of the results. Using multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis, a six-cluster solution was used, representing key themes related to supporting studentsâ€™ efforts as helpful bystanders. Overall, findings indicate a need for bystander intervention efforts to widen their focus by using an intersectional, social justice lens. Study participants identified various forms of racism, homophobia, transphobia, and microaggressions as intertwined with their ability to be active bystanders on college campuses.

The documents below constitute examples of guidance from the President and U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) that outline the protections provided in law against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, and intersex traits in light of the Supreme Court’s holding in Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S.Ct. 1731, 590 U.S. ___ (2020), that the prohibition on discrimination “because of . . . sex” under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., covers discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation. Executive Order 13988, Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation - “Application of Bostock v. Clayton County to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,” Memorandum of Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Pamela S. Karlan, Civil Rights Division, Mar. 26, 2021 - “Interpretation of Bostock v. Clayton County regarding the nondiscrimination provisions of the Safe Streets Act, the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, the Victims of Crime Act, and the Violence Against Women Act,” Memorandum of Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, Civil Rights Division, Mar. 10, 2022 - This guidance establishes that the sex discrimination prohibitions of the following laws enforced by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the DOJ’s Office of Justice Programs prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, and intersex traits: Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq.) - The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. § 10101, et seq.) - The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (34 U.S.C. § 11101, et seq.) - The Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (34 U.S.C. § 20101, et seq.) - The Violence Against Women Act (34 U.S.C. § 12291(b)(13) ) - The OCR enforces the preceding laws, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, and intersex traits. (The nondiscrimination provision in the Violence Against Women Act, which pre-dates Bostock, also explicitly references sexual orientation and gender identity as separate protected classes.) Any person that believes they have been discriminated against by a recipient of Federal financial assistance from the DOJ on the basis of sex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, or intersex traits, may file a complaint with the OCR. The OCR recommends including the following information when filing your complaint: Your name and contact information, including a phone number and email address, if available, and, if different, the name and contact information of the person or persons who experienced the discrimination; - The name and address of the entity that allegedly discriminated; - The exact date when the alleged discrimination took place or was discovered; - A detailed description of the alleged discrimination and why you believe it was based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or intersex traits; - A list of any people whom we might contact for additional information to support or clarify your complaint; and - Copies of records or any other documentary evidence. - Potential complainants are encouraged to review the documents above and can find more information about filing a complaint here.

Informed by the intersectionality perspective and the Cuban dominance thesis, the author predicted that respondents would experience higher levels of victimization than what law enforcement data capture, yet the vast majority of these crimes would go unreported (Hypothesis 1); Respondents or third parties would be more likely to report victimization to police as crime severity increased (Hypothesis 2); and Cuban LGBTQ victims would be more likely to report crime than non-Cuban Latines (Hypothesis 3). Method: Four hundred LGBTQ immigrant Latine individuals (age: M = 37.7 years, Cuban = 51.5%, transgender = 5.8%) in Miami completed face-to-face interviews through a three-stage venue-based sampling procedure. Results: Although 48% of screened respondents reported experiencing at least one incident of victimization within 5 years, they reported only 15% of these incidents to police (supporting Hypothesis 1). Increased violent and property crime were associated with markedly increased reporting (odds ratio [OR] = 5.44, p < .001), as was the use of a weapon (OR = 2.80, p < .01; supporting Hypothesis 2). Friends’ encouragement to report a crime was by far the strongest predictor of crime reporting (OR = 12.47, p < .001). Cuban Americans were less likely to report anti-LGBTQ hate crimes to the police, although this effect was not statistically significant after models accounted for documented and new immigrant measures of (supporting Hypothesis 3). Conclusions: Hate crime victimization and underreporting were prevalent in this sample. Given the different crime-reporting outcomes for Cuban victims, it is important to examine victimization and crime reporting among the Latine population by country of origin. Queer networks and friends within the LGBTQ community may facilitate reporting crime and seeking help. (Publisher abstract provided) 810 Seventh Street NW, Washington, DC 20531, United States

In this climate, LGBTQ+ youth are quickly losing access to critical resources, supportive programming, and spaces of belonging. In addition, many caring adults, mentors, child welfare providers, educators, and youth serving organizations are unsure of what, if anything, they can do to affirm LGBTQ+ young people in their care. In this webinar, Dr. Christian Rummell and Nia Clark, MSW will highlight steps your mentoring program can take to create a more inclusive and affirming program climate for LGBTQ+ youth in your care. This session highlights guidance from the LGBTQ+ Supplement to the Elements of Effective Practice for Mentoring and contains tools, resources, and a roadmap for organizational policy change.

This article examines police relationships with marginalized and minority groups, and specifically, with LGBTQ+ people. Noting the roots of the gay liberation movement from the 1970s and Stonewall Riots, the article discusses research that reveals the experiences of LGBTQ+ people with regards to criminal victimization rates; it highlights connections and reasons for solidarity between Black and LGTBT+ people, as well as some results of that solidarity in activism. The article provides an examination of how LGBTQ+ people perceive the police today, and how answers vary among diverse types of people within those communities. The authors describe their survey of a national sample of LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ adults in the United States which used NORC’s AmeriSpeak panel. The article presents data results from the survey, and discusses the authors’ research findings which demonstrated that the importance of bringing LGBTQ+ people into national assessments of the police and policing should not be underestimated.

Abstract First, definitions are provided for "sexual orientation," "questioning," "gender identity," and "transgender." This is followed by a review of research on the prevalence of LGBTQ youths in the juvenile justice system. Available research indicates that LGBT youths compose 5-7 percent of the Nation's youth population, but compose 13-15 percent of youth currently in the juvenile justice system (Hunt and Moodie-Mills, 2012; Majd, Marksamer, and Reyes, 2009). Distinctive risk and protective factors regarding delinquent behavior among LGBTQ youth are then discussed based on a research review. Regarding outcome evidence for programs that target LGBTQ youth, there are only a few programs that target their specific needs; and even fewer evaluations have examined the effectiveness of such efforts. The features and findings of these evaluations are discussed. Overall, the research on services and treatment for LGBTQ youth, including adaptations of evidence-based programs, is still being developed. The reports that have provided guidance and recommendations for policymakers and practitioners who work with these youth in the juvenile justice system have focused on changing juvenile justice policies and practices to ensure equitable treatment and effective responses for them. Recommendations regarding LGBTQ youth are outlined from the National Standards for the Care of Youth Charged With Status Offenses, which were developed by the Coalition for Juvenile Justice (2013). Other publications that have focused on addressing the needs of LGBTQ youth in the justice system are also reviewed. 27 references Grant Number(s) Agencies OJJDP-Sponsored Publication Type Research (Applied/Empirical) Report (Study/Research) Report (Grant Sponsored) Literature Review Date Published: August 1, 2014

Abstract Preliminary research suggests that partner violence is a problem among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) college youth. However, there is no study to date with college youth on the factors associated with perpetration of same-sex partner violence, which is needed to inform prevention efforts specific to this population. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to assess how facets of minority stress (i.e., sexual-orientation-related victimization, sexual minority stigma, internalized homonegativity, sexual identity concealment) relate to physical, sexual, and psychological partner violence perpetration among LGBTQ college youth (N = 391; 49 percent identified as men; 72 percent Caucasian; M age: 20.77 years). At the bivariate level, physical perpetration was related to identity concealment and internalized homonegativity; sexual perpetration was related to internalized homonegativity; and psychological perpetration was related to sexual-orientation-related victimization. However, at the multivariate level (after controlling for concurrent victimization), psychological perpetration was unrelated to minority stress variables, whereas physical and sexual perpetration were both related to internalized homonegativity; physical perpetration was also related to identity concealment. These results underscore the utility of understanding partner violence among LGBTQ youth through a minority stress framework. Moreover, the current study highlights the need for a better understanding of factors that mediate and moderate the relationship between minority stress and partner violence perpetration among LGBTQ youth in order to inform prevention and intervention efforts.

Much of the disparate outcomes experienced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other identities along the spectrum (LGBTQ+) people of color are directly linked to the practices of public actors and through institutional policies. This is perhaps no truer than for LGBTQ+ individuals of color in their interactions with police. Findings of the current study suggest that participants perceive predatory policing as part of the everyday practices of the New Orleans Police Department, where modes of power and social control tactics are regularly used to maintain systems of oppression. Ultimately, the goal of this project was to use the lived experience to explore the presence of predatory policing to understand how it has contributed to the marginalization of LGBTQ+ identifying individuals of color.

Abstract Findings of the study address the experiences and needs of LGBTQ survivors of sexual violence. Participants believe that sexual violence is a problem within the LGBTQ community, and that prevention efforts tailored to the community are needed. Findings confirm the issues of an overall discrimination and misunderstanding toward and about the LGBTQ community and their impact on the response to sexual violence, intervention, and prevention; the lack of public discussion of these issues; and gaps and barriers in public services for LGBTQ persons. Data were collected through a survey and during focus group interviews. Data were analyzed separately, with survey findings leading to focus group questions. Tables, figure, notes, and references

Abstract The articles, reports, and films listed in the bibliography explore sexual violence against individuals who identify as LGBTQ from a variety of angles, including lifetime sexual victimization, intimate partner violence, sexual violence as hate/bias crimes, and service provisions for survivors. The research examined indicates that sexual violence is an important concern for individuals and communities who identify as LGBTQ. Individuals who identify as LGBTQ appear to be at higher risk for sexual victimization than the general population, and may encounter barriers to services because of homophobia and transphobia. Intersections between various forms of oppression may exacerbate these challenges, making it important to address LGBTQ sexual victimization alongside sexism, racism, ableism, and other variables.

Abstract In this publication, LGBTQ+ refers to "lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people, as well as all those whose sexual orientations and gender identities (or the lack thereof) do not conform to societal norms." Statistical evidence indicates that LGBTQ+ Americans are much more likely to be victims of violence than the general U.S. population; and this violence is often repetitive, since it has been documented that once a person becomes a victim of violence, she/he is more likely to be re-victimized. Such statistical evidence challenges us to prevent and provide early intervention for LGBTQ+ youth. After exploring the data and research that documents early victimization and violence against LGBTQ+ children and youth, this publication discusses the importance and the means of providing "safe, stable. nurturing relationships (SSNRs)" as a model of prevention and intervention for LGBTQ+ children and youth. What victim service providers can do to design and implement this model is discussed, followed by consideration of what any adult can do to create safe, stable, nurturing relationships for children and youth, particularly LGBTQ+ children and youth, who are at increased risk for abuse and violence. The discussion expands upon some of the following suggestions: 1) Show support publicly; 2) support and link parents; 3) Advocate for inclusive faith communities; 4) Advocate for positive policy changes; and 5) encourage LGBTQ+ youth groups to invite parents.

Abstract The proposed sexual health care standards are especially important because adolescents confined to foster care and juvenile justice facilities are overwhelmingly members of the communities most affected by and at risk for HIV/AIDS. They are low-income Black and Latino youth, with a relatively high proportion who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning youth (LGBTQ) who are survivors of violence and other abuse. Although these youth are at a proportionally greater risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) than the general youth population, they are more likely to be denied access to appropriate and effective HIV prevention, sexual health education, and sexual and reproductive health care. When health care is provided, it often ignores or isolates LGBTQ youth and their health needs. In an effort to address this health crisis, the Center for HIV Law and Policy (CHLP) launched the Teen SENSE initiative (Sexual Health and Education Now in State Environments). This is a sexual health and HIV prevention initiative based in the rights of youth to receive these services. Teen SENSE has engaged experts in adolescent medicine, sexual health education, foster care, and juvenile justice for the purpose of developing a complete advocacy model and coordinate its implementation. A Federal and State legal framework has been developed that asserts the legal right of adolescents to comprehensive, scientifically accurate, LGBTQ-inclusive sexual health care, services, and education. In the current report, Teen SENSE presents 45 model standards that support health screenings that include sexual histories; information and treatment for sexual abuse, pregnancy, and STI transmissions; and ongoing care and discharge planning related to sexual health.

Abstract Participants were recruited primarily through an online consumer panel invitation and also from learning about the study through Illinois victim service providers. A total of 1,569 individuals completed the online victim needs assessment survey, 41 percent of whom lived in Chicago or its neighboring counties. Most participants were White (75 percent), followed by African-American (11 percent), Hispanic or Latino (9 percent), Asian (6 percent), or other (2 percent). Individuals who identified as LGBTQ+ were more likely than non-LGBTQ+ individuals to report having been victimized at some point in their lifetimes; and they were more likely to have experienced a violent crime in their lifetimes. Other crimes they were more likely to experience were sexual assault, domestic violence, stalking, physical abuse as an adult, physical or sexual abuse as a child, and to have witnessed a homicide. There was no difference in the overall number of victimizations in comparing gay or lesbian individuals and bisexual individuals. In seeking help for their victimization, LGBTQ+ individuals were most likely to contact friends and mental health providers for support. Medical providers, victim-service providers, and hotlines were the least likely to be sought for help. LGBTQ+ victims who did not report their victimization to police cited anticipated negative responses from police. Not knowing how to access appropriate services was the greatest barrier to seeking and receiving victimization services. Recommendations for policy and practice are discussed. 4 figures

Abstract Two survey forms were administered, one asking respondents to estimate incidence of bias and harassment, and another with two additional questions with examples of homophobic epithets. Quantitative analysis showed that only 16 percent of school psychologists reported they observed bias and harassment once a month or more frequently. However, 43 percent of participants reported hearing epithets such as "that's so gay" among students once a month or more frequently. Also, 8 percent and 45 percent of respondents reported that these epithets were spoken by other staff members at least once a month or once a year, respectively. School psychologists responded to direct verbal insults but often ignored homophobic language not specifically directed at people. Findings were framed by the culture of heteronormativity and microaggressions in schools. Abstract published by arrangement with Taylor and Francis.

Abstract The survey findings show that in 2009 LGBTQ victims of crime still did not have consistent access to culturally competent services designed to prevent and address the violence perpetrated against them. Frequently, mainstream victim assistance agencies cannot meet the needs of LGBTQ crime victims in culturally sensitive ways; and LGBTQ-specific anti-violence programs either lack the resources for effective implementation or do not exist at all. Given these findings, this report offers four recommendations. First, build collaboration among LGBTQ anti-violence programs and mainstream victim assistance providers in order to increase the availability of culturally competent services for LGBTQ victims of crime. This should include LGBTQ-specific training for criminal and civil justice system personnel and victim assistance providers. Second, evaluate the implementation of State and Federal protection for victims of crime and pursue policy and legislative changes that will ensure LGBTQ victims have equal access to protections. Third, increase public awareness of the prevalence and impact of violence against LGBTQ individuals and communities, as well as crime victims' rights and services using national and local public awareness, education, and outreach campaigns. Fourth, increase State and Federal funding for collaboration, training, outreach, services, research, and data collection on the victimization of LGBTQ individuals. 31 notes

The Richmond Police Department (RPD) requests consideration of $300,000 in support of the BJA FY 21 Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Program. This funding (for 36 months) will allow the RPD to coordinate training, education, and awareness of hate crimes toward the LGBTQ+ community and a variety of strategies and partners to achieve the goals and objectives of this program. In partnership with Virginia Anti-Violence Project (VAVP), RPD intends to use the funding to train and educate law enforcement, community members, local colleges and universities, and community partners on hate crimes/bias-motivated crimes but most importantly underreported hate crimes and the lack of trust the LGBTQ+ community has for agencies created to protect them. For more than five years, RPD has demonstrated its concern for the LGBTQ+ community through its partnership with VAVP and has represented law enforcement at community meetings; however, the need to extend our representation as a law enforcement agency goes beyond our physical presence. Hate crimes towards the LGBTQ+ community go unreported daily. Coupled with minimal training and awareness, RPD recognizes the need to fully support underserved populations. We can continue this work with grant funding, community partnerships, and support.

The Project will utilize community assessment and relationship-building, training, data collection, and advocacy to support survivors and create replicable resources for other communities to do the same. The Project will develop a model in New York City (NYC) that can be scaled for national replication. AVP receives funding through the Office for Violence Against Women in two grants: 1) Legal Assistance to Victims grant funds direct civil legal services for survivors of intimate partner and sexual violence (IPV/SV); and 2) Grants for Outreach and Services to Underserved Populations, that funds AVP work with Caribbean-American LGBTQ people at risk for or experiencing IPV/SV in NYC. The Project will utilize community assessment and relationship-building, training, data collection, and advocacy to support survivors and create replicable resources for other communities to do the same, thus increasing reporting of and community-based responses to hate violence, drawing on community strength, expertise, and resilience. Data collection, analysis, & mapping is essential the Project, ensuring the Project can identify and better understand the gaps between data collected and documented by city government (e.g. NYC Police Department Hate Crimes Task Force and by the NYC Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes, with data collected by CBOs. To support the project goal of strengthening linkages between diverse CBOs and LGBTQ community members, working to prevent hate violence and crime, AVP will collaborate with Project partners to 1) collect, analyze, and map data on HV occurring in NYC; 2) create a Community Safety Planning for Events Training and set of workbook materials; 3) create a guide for individual survivors on how to report the violence they have experienced to local CBOs and other government agencies; 4) Pilot and evaluate trainings in NYC; 5) Create and facilitate a train the trainer workshop; 6) Create a Policy paper with recommendations on how to create community-led safety initiatives; and 7) write and share a final report.

This project will take place statewide across the state of Nevada. This application requests $399,997 to complete program activities. The proposed program will establish a cross-disciplinary Advisory Committee of community-based organizations who will work collectively to analyze data to assess and enhance reporting of hate crimes. The Committee will focus on addressing the systemic issues that inhibit justice when a hate crime occurs, clarifying possible reasons for lack of reporting and educating community leaders and decision makers about best practices regarding the collection of SOGI data when hate crimes are reported. In order to address the rising incidence of anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes in Nevada, this program will build cross-community cohesion and resilience, ensure LGBTQ+ Nevadans are equipped with the knowledge, skills and resources to report hate crimes and access support, and work to improve hate crime reporting through systems change. Key elements of the work will include (1) Creating new resources and updating long outdated, currently available LGBTQ+ specific resources for hate crime intervention and prevention. These resources will be available online for statewide download and access, and distributed to community partners. (2) Disseminating educational materials among the broader LGBTQ+ community and its allies. (3) Establishing an Advisory Committee of cross-community organizations, who will collectively develop a document with formal recommendations to improve LGBTQ+ access to justice in the wake of hate crimes, and conduct outreach and education among legislators, local government officials and community leaders with the goal of supporting systems change.

SCDJJ’s Preventing Sexual Violence and Victimization Project is designed to reduce the occurrence of sexual assault and harassment in its five secure facilities by providing educational materials to youth and staff, also providing extensive Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) and LGBTQ+ training for all SCDJJ employees, contractors, interns, and volunteers. SCDJJ has established policies and protocols to prevent sexual abuse and harassment of youths. However, the latest data for FY 2021-2022 indicates a marginal rise in PREA-related incidents compared to previous fiscal years. In order to maintain zero tolerance for such misconduct, we recognize the importance of providing continuous education, training, and awareness of PREA standards and emerging trends in this field to our staff. The goal of this project is to educate the staff on the latest policies and practices of PREA, with a special focus on LGBTQ+ young adults. The aim is to improve the staff's knowledge of PREA and best practices when dealing with LGBTQ+ youth, also providing them with informative documentation, posters, pamphlets, and pocket cards that can serve as quick reference guides while in the field. SCDJJ will procure the services of an external trainer with subject matter expertise in the LGBTQ+ community and PREA standards for Juvenile Facilities. The subject matter expert will train the agency on how to safely apply standards within the secure facilities in a manner that minimizes risk for all youth, including those who identify as LGBTQ+. In addition, the subject matter expert will work closely with the agency’s Director of Professional Standards, Standards Manager, and other key staff to review and update the staffing policies, review supplemental forms and documentation, and incorporate changes and updates to the policy, as needed.

Funded research projects seek answers to questions that will inform policy and suggest ways to enhance the juvenile justice system. As set forth in the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as amended (Pub. L. No. 93-415, 42 U.S.C. § 5601 et seq.), OJJDP may conduct research or evaluation in juvenile justice matters, for the purpose of providing research and evaluation relating to control of juvenile delinquency and serious crime committed by juveniles; successful efforts to prevent first-time minor offenders from committing subsequent involvement in serious crime; successful efforts to prevent recidivism; and the juvenile justice system. This program is authorized pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 3796ee et seq. The study will assess the characteristics and needs of the Lesbian, Gay, Bi-Sexual, Transgender, and Questioning (LGBTQ) and young men who have sex with men (YMSM) populations involved in the commercial sex market to learn about their interactions with law enforcement, prosecutors, and court personnel. In addition to examining interactions the applicants will assess how LGBTQ youth enter the system, what options are available at sentencing, what services are available after detention and what percentage of youth return to the streets after serving their sentence. Applicants propose a multi method approach including the use of Respondent Driven Sampling to recruit 300 youth for in-depth interviews. The study will also include multiple field and court observations, as well as semi-structured interviews and focus groups with key juvenile justice stakeholders. The results of the study will enhance law enforcement, prosecutor, and service provider knowledge, indentify training opportunities, and assist policy makers. CA/NCF

Juveniles in Residential Placement, 2013 NCJ 249507 Since 1997, OJJDP has sponsored the U.S. Census Bureau to conduct the Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement. This survey details the characteristics of youth held for delinquency and status offenses in public and private residential facilities in every state. The data provide a detailed picture of these youth, including their age, gender, race, offenses, and adjudication status. The 2013 census shows that the number of youth in placement continues to decline. In 1997, 105,055 youth were held in out-of-home placement. Although the number of youth in confinement increased 4 percent between 1997 and 1999, by 2013, that number had decreased 50 percent to 54,148, its lowest level. Relative declines from 1997 to 2013 were greater for committed youth than for detained youth. View and download this bulletin and accompanying data snapshot. Child Victims of Stereotypical Kidnappings Known to Law Enforcement in 2011 NCJ 249249 This bulletin summarizes findings on the incidence and characteristics of stereotypical kidnappings of children in 2011 and compares them with 1997 findings. An estimated 105 children were victims of stereotypical kidnappings in 2011, virtually the same as the 1997 estimate. Most kidnappings involved the use of force or threats, and about three in five victims were sexually assaulted, abused, or exploited. Victims were, most commonly, ages 12 to 17, girls, white, and living in situations other than with two biological or adoptive parents. Half of all stereotypical kidnappings in 2011 were sexually motivated crimes against adolescent girls. Most perpetrators of 2011 stereotypical kidnappings were male, were ages 18 to 35, and were white or black in equal proportions. View and download this bulletin.

The page includes links to videos and other resources designed for youth, parents and caregivers of youth who identify as 2SLGBTQ+, educators and facilitators, professionals who work in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems, and healthcare professionals. A video created for the webpage explains the origins of the term “Two-Spirit,” stressing that it refers to a gender uniquely recognized by Native American cultures. “The term Two-Spirit is a Native concept created by Native people and should only be used by Native individuals who identify as Native LGBTQ+ or Two-Spirit,” the recording states. The term was coined in 1990 but refers to a culturally and spiritually distinct gender—housing both a masculine and a feminine spirit—that has been recognized for centuries by Native American nations.

The population to be served is girls and boys, including LGBTQ youth who are at risk or are victims of CSE and DST. The grantees will develop or update strategies to recruit and maintain mentors to serve this population; begin or enhance efforts to identify and enroll girls and boys, including LGBTQ youth who are in need of services; and provide needed services to these youth. Grantees will join current and previously funded grantees and work with OJJDP's training and technical assistance provider to develop or enhance mentoring service models and mentor training based on best practices. The Sacramento City Unified School District (SCUSD) has been providing services to at-risk and CSEC survivors since 2009. Mentoring is a key component of SCUSDs mission to ensure that students graduate as globally competitive lifelong learners, prepared to succeed in a career and higher education institution of their choice to secure gainful employment and contribute to society. The SCUSDs Youth Development Support Services (YDSS) department staff and partners will leverage their relationships with young people to provide direct services while youth and CSEC survivor voices will guide and direct programming. Survivor voices are elevated through the STREAT Team (Students Together Reducing Exploitation And Trafficking), a youth voice and action group founded by youth survivors and peer allies to reduce CSEC in the Sacramento area. Building on the success of the STREAT Team, YDSS will implement the Youth in Action mentoring program to support the enhancement of mentoring service models and mentor training to focus on the needs of girls and boys, including LGBTQ youth, who are at risk or are victims of commercial sexual exploitation and domestic sex trafficking. The Youth in Action mentoring program will partner with local service providers to provide survivors and high-risk youth with coordinated case management through collaborative partnerships. Over the three-year grant period, up to 120 exploited and at-risk youth will be provided positive adult mentors and enhanced support services through coordinated case management. Mentors will also facilitate referrals for case management to YDSS staff and community partners as needed. Objectives of the program are: 1) Reduce the likelihood of commercial sexual exploitation and domestic sex trafficking victimization and increase the likelihood of positive outcomes for up to 120 youth; 2) Enhance training for 10 mentors and provide ongoing development and support after the initial training is complete; and, 3) Enhance direct services to up to 120 girls and boys, including LGBTQ youth, who are at risk for or victims of commercial sexual exploitation and domestic sex trafficking.

The key findings and corresponding recommendations of this study are intended to assist police and prosecutors in identifying and investigating hate crimes, assist crime victims, and engage with the LGBTQ community. The main data source for this study was the interviews with 400 Latine LGBTQ individuals who have experienced what they perceived as a crime within the 5 years preceding the interview. All respondents were required to be 18 years old or older, Latine, self-identified as LGBTQ, have experienced victimization, and not had more than two drinks prior to the interview. To measure the criminal justice system’s challenges and opportunities for reforming it, 10 practitioners were interviewed, all of whom were identified through a combination of key informants’ referrals and “snowball” sampling. The sample included all practitioners who had any direct experience with hate crime cases. Data were collected on victimization, crime-reporting and case processing, consequences of victimization, and hate-crime prosecution. Based on these findings, seven policy recommendations address the Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office (SAO), the Miami-Dade Police Department (MDPD), and other law enforcement agencies in Miami-Dade. The recommendations pertain to hate-crime detection protocol, specialized workforce development, victim engagement in lieu of subpoena, the training of criminal justice practitioners, change in the hate-crime statute, data and research, and communication and awareness building. The report also advises that although the recommendations focus on addressing anti-LGBTQ hate crimes, most of the recommendations are also relevant to addressing hate crimes motivated by victims’ race, ethnicity, religion, or other protected characteristics.

Within the LGBTQ community, the risk of violent victimization is highly concentrated among transgender individuals, and especially transgender persons of color. Between 2014 and 2022, the number of hate crime incidents involving transgender individuals reported to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report (UCR) program increased by 364%. Over the past several decades (and especially in the last 10 years), larger metropolitan police departments have increasingly used specialized liaison officers or units to improve their outreach to and interactions with the LGBTQ community. LGBTQ liaison officers and units provide a range of services within departments, including outreach to members of the LGBTQ community, support for victims of violent crime, and (in some departments) direct response to hate crime‒related call for service. Despite growing implementation of these liaison services, there is little systematic or empirical evaluation of these units, especially in relation to their transgender-specific outreach and ability to report, identify, and respond to transgender hate crime victimization. To address this gap, we propose a parallel convergent mixed-methods case study research design to assess the efficacy of police departments’ LGBTQ liaison services in addressing transgender-specific hate crime victimization and response. Our multidisciplinary project team will include researchers from CNA’s Center for Justice Research and Innovation (JRI) as well as subject matter experts who are well-versed in constructing and implementing LGBTQ liaison units in police departments. The proposed study will include collection and analysis of various data sources, including calls for service, surveys, on-site observations, interviews, and community listening sessions. With this interdisciplinary, mixed methods study, the CNA team will produce numerous actionable findings, recommendations, and products that can improve the field of policing, especially in relation to transgender hate crime victimization response. This investigation will also lay the foundation for more rigorous studies that can use experimental or quasi-experimental designs to explore causality between approaches and outcomes. Given the important and timely nature of this topic, we will use a rigorous dissemination plan to translate findings into a variety of products for scholars and practitioners. CNA will utilize our JusticeTalks podcast series and the CNA InDepth blog, write journal articles, and present findings at academic conferences.

Despite this and other recent incidents of violence against the LGBTQ community, social science research on the prevalence and nature of hate crimes against LGBTQ persons remains limited. Similarly, the criminal justice system is not capable of effectively identifying and handling such crimes. The Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office, the Miami- Dade Police Department. Safeguarding American Values for Everyone (SAVE) LGBTQ and Florida International University came together in 2018 to launch this project. With funding from the National Institute of Justice, these institutions have collected and examined data and came up with an ambitious plan to increase public safety and enhance the LGBTQ community’s well-being.

This project has three primary objectives: (1) identify the characteristics of victims of sexual orientation and gender identity bias-motivated violence and assess how those relate to victims’ decisions to report crimes and to whom; (2) evaluate law enforcement policies, procedures, and practices related to responding to violence against LGBTQ+ victims and assess how those relate to law enforcement decisions to categorize such incidents as hate crimes; and (3) develop evidence-based policy standards and procedural tools for law enforcement to increase accurate reporting and classification of anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes. This study will employ a three-stage, mixed-methods research approach working in partnership with police departments in four regionally diverse jurisdictions: Atlanta GA (Southeast), Dallas TX (Southwest), San Diego CA (West), and Milwaukee WI (Midwest). Stage 1 of the project will include conducting a quantitative web-survey of relevant community, interpersonal, and individual characteristics of local LGBTQ+ adults, as well as an environmental scan of policies and procedures related to hate crime reporting in local police departments. Stage 2 of the project will include in-depth interviews with LGBTQ+ victims and law enforcement to evaluate individual decision-making processes of hate crime reporting and classification. Stage 3 will leverage results from Stages 1 and 2 to develop and disseminate a set of evidence-based recommendations for law enforcement to increase the accurate reporting and classification of anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes. Project findings will be disseminated via scientific journals and be used to develop policy standards and tools for law enforcement. This research-to-translation approach will help to advance scholarship on anti-LGBTQ+ hate crime reporting and will directly advance the law enforcement policies, procedures, and statutes used for identifying and defining hate crimes against LGBTQ+ populations.

A 2011 Department of Justice report detailing the investigation of the NOPD highlights the presence of discriminatory policing practices against people of color and members of the LGBTQ community. Within the report, the Department of Justice specifically discussed biased policing with stops, arrests and other encounters between the NOPD and Latinos, Blacks, and the LGBTQ community. People of color who identify as LGBTQ, particularly trans-women of color, are highly stigmatized within the United States. As a result, this study focuses on the interactions, experiences, and perceptions held by people of color who identify as LGBTQ. Intersectional subjection, the process in which governmentality is used to marginalize and subjugate individuals with multifaceted identities, is used to analyze individual perceptions related to interactions with law enforcement officers. We propose a community based, mixed-method Q-study to examine participant perspectives of law enforcement personnel in New Orleans. With support from local community based organizations, we first, will conduct narrative interviews of 25 New Orleans residents who are of color and identify as LGBTQ. Participants will be asked to share experiences and interactions with members of the New Orleans Police Department. With the same 25 participants, we will then use the data collected from narrative interviews to conduct Q-sorts in order to empirically answer: In what ways do LGBTQ people of color perceive intersectional subjection when interacting with the New Orleans Police Department? While previous research has been conducted exploring the socio-legal landscape of race, sexual orientation, and law enforcement, little to no studies have focused on the perspectives of the individuals directly impacted by discriminatory policing. Findings from this study will 1) help amplify the voices of those at the intersection of race, gender and LGBTQ identification, 2) inform how prevalent intersectional subjectivity is in interactions with the NOPD and 3) inform policy to decrease the effects of targeted discrimination, social control, and marginalization of those at the intersection of race, gender and LGBTQ identification. Expected products from this study include peer reviewed journal publications, white papers, publications in popular media outlets, a community-based initiative designed to help address the marginalizing effects of discriminatory policing in New Orleans, and a (proposed) book with Rutgers University Press. ca/ncf Similar Awards Enhancing Equitable Forensic Identification: An Evaluation of Pelvic Morphology for Parity Detection and Age Estimation in Unidentified Skeletal Remains - Evaluation of the Kings Against Violence Initiative's (KAVI) Hospital-Based Violence Intervention Program (HVIP) - Evaluating Virtual Reality Enhancements of an Evidence-based Multi-tiered Aggression & Bullying Prevention Program -

This article examines police relationships with marginalized and minority groups, and specifically, with LGBTQ+ people. Noting the roots of the gay liberation movement from the 1970s and Stonewall Riots, the article discusses research that reveals the experiences of LGBTQ+ people with regards to criminal victimization rates; it highlights connections and reasons for solidarity between Black and LGTBT+ people, as well as some results of that solidarity in activism. The article provides an examination of how LGBTQ+ people perceive the police today, and how answers vary among diverse types of people within those communities. The authors describe their survey of a national sample of LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ adults in the United States which used NORC’s AmeriSpeak panel. The article presents data results from the survey, and discusses the authors’ research findings which demonstrated that the importance of bringing LGBTQ+ people into national assessments of the police and policing should not be underestimated.

Today, over fifty years after Stonewall, many cities have implemented community policing efforts and appointed LGBTQ-police liaisons to help improve this historically fraught relationship. Police often even march in Pride parades—something that has caused considerable consternation among some segments of the LGBTQ community recently. Ample evidence reveals that LGBTQ people are overcriminalized, continue to face harassment and abuse by police, and are incarcerated at three times the rate of the general population. These disparities are compounded by race, class, and gender presentation. Sociologists have shown that “legal cynicism” characterizes groups that have had negative relations with law enforcement, such as communities of color. These negative experiences lead some people to avoid reporting crimes, seeking help from the police, or otherwise interacting with state institutions. These same forces are likely at work in the LGBTQ community. Surprisingly, we know very little about these issues in relation to LGBTQ people. We propose the first study to use a nationally representative probability sample of LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ individuals to assess their experiences with, perceptions of, and attitudes toward law enforcement. We do so to better understand similarities and differences along these lines between the two populations. Additionally, we will conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with a subset of respondents to achieve greater insight into LGBTQ-police interactions, perceptions, and attitudes and to supplement the probability sample with perspectives from particularly hard to reach but important populations who may be underrepresented in the larger sample, such as people of color and transgender people.

This webinar will discuss and explore safe care of the sexual assault victims within the LGBTQ community and will focus on the transgender community to better understand the spectrum of gender. The presenter will discuss the difference between gender and sexuality and discuss ways to look at forensic practices to increase gender awareness and inclusion. The webinar will illustrate practical ways to incorporate education, awareness, and improve services provided currently to ensure victims from any culture may feel safer reporting sexual assault. Additionally, the presenter will discuss reasons why victims may not access care and look at the increased risk of sexual violence in the LGBTQ population.

School climate is a factor that has garnered significant attention. Perceptions of school contexts may even be mechanisms that define how victimization relates to poor outcomes; however, there is a lack of rigorous scholarship that could demonstrate directionality and therefore further augment understanding of these relations. Specifically, it is not clear whether victimization is strictly an antecedent to mental health issues like depressive symptoms. In the current study, self-report measures were completed at 3 time points across 3 school years in 6 Midwest high schools. Structural equation modeling indicated that peer victimization was an antecedent to depressive symptoms, and that school belonging mediated the association. Implications and future directions are discussed.

Eight in-person focus groups and seven telephone-based one-on-one interviews were conducted with U.S. youth ages from 11 to 20 years (N=48). Two focus groups were conducted with Black, Multiracial, Latinx, Native American, and LGBTQ+ youth. Seven LGBTQ+ youth participated in one-on-one telephone-based interviews. Focus group participants and interview subjects were asked the same 11 questions from a semi-structured focus group question guide. Five questions were on the topic of dating behaviors in general. In addition, six questions were asked for reactions to a paper-based list of 75 abusive acts. Youth generated ideas for 10 new possible cyber-ADA items and 14 emotionally abusive items for inclusion on the ADA measurement instrument. They did not generate any new physical or sexual ADA items. Youth identified 14 acts that they felt should not be on the measure, either because the acts were not abusive and too common, because they could not understand the item, or because it seemed unrealistic as an act of ADA. The study faced several limitations and was a good first step toward enriching the cultural inclusivity of the ADA measurement instrument. Continued attention to inclusionary research that seeks to understand the cultural milieu of diverse participants is essential for violence prevention scholarship and subsequent health programming and policy that derive from it.
