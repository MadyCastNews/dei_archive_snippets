> DLA Land and Maritime celebrates diversity at Pride Month event The Defense Federal Community celebrated LGBTQ Pride Month at the Defense Supply Center Columbus Operations Center June 6. The program was hosted by the Defense Logistics Agency Land and Maritime Office of Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity and the LGBTQ Employment Program. This year’s theme, “Being Your Authentic Self,” encourages people to embrace who they are to empower themselves and others. “That’s what makes us stronger as a workforce, as an agency and as a nation,” said DLA Land and Maritime Deputy Commander Kenneth Watson, opening the program by highlighting why the Agency prioritizes celebrating diversity.” We share a common mission to support the Warfighter. It is through that common mission that we are bound together, through unity of purpose.” “You being here today is a reflection of your shared commitment to each other,” he continued. “To embracing a diverse workplace, and to working as a team toward mission success - equipping our Warfighters with the tools they need to defend our nation, and our democratic principles abroad.” With opening remarks concluded, attendees had the opportunity to hear from two keynote speakers: Jody Davis, an LGBTQ veteran care coordinator with the Department of Veterans Affairs, and Mark Lankford, a contracting officer for DLA Land and Maritime – both military veterans and proud members of the LGBTQ community. Each shared their personal experiences with military and federal civilian service. Davis joined the U.S. Army right after high school in 1987 and served as an armor crewman until 1995. She spoke about her service during the “don’t ask, don’t tell” era. “This basically told everyone, ‘You’ve got to be quiet. You can’t talk about your sexuality, and you can’t talk about your gender identity,’” she said. “So, what I can do now at the VA is say, ‘Please do tell us. Please let us ask you these questions, and please feel safe to [answer these questions].’” “It is a real privilege to be here and to just be authentic,” she added. “For the vast majority of my life, I hid in the shadows and felt a lot of shame and guilt for who I really was. So, having a Pride Month and being able to be here is an amazing gift.” Lankford, an Air Force veteran who came to DLA Land and Maritime in 2015 through the Pathways to Career Excellence program, also shared his experiences in the military and how the Air Force core values have been guiding principles throughout his career and to being his authentic self. “The Air Force core values are integrity first, service before self and excellence in all you do. You have integrity first. You don’t lie about who you are. That puts you in a position of degrading yourself,” he said. “I think being authentic is being authentic not only with those around you but also being authentic with yourself.” “It’s ok to be yourself – to be who you are and to be part of a team,” he added. “And I thank DLA for being very open and embracing of the LGBTQ community.” The program concluded with a video presentation of “Let the River Run” by the Columbus Gay Men’s Chorus. Defense Finance and Accounting Service LGBTQ Executive Champion Angie Oberhauser presented Davis and Lankford with mementos. DLA Land and Maritime LGBTQ Employment Program Executive Champion Julie Van Schaik provided closing remarks thanking Davis and Lankford for sharing their stories and all those involved in putting the event together. DLA Land and Maritime Contract Specialist Nancy Hunt served as Mistress of Ceremonies, Army veteran and guest singer Mark Cooke rendered the National Anthem and DLA Land and Maritime Contract Specialist Robert ‘Scott’ Humphrey delivered the invocation.

> DLA Troop Support – The Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support welcomed the first gay person to serve as mayor of a major American city for its first virtual observation of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual and Queer Pride Month. Annise Parker is the former mayor of Houston and serves as both the president and CEO of the LGBTQ Victory Fund and Victory Institute. These organizations work to increase the number of LGBTQ people in public office and provides programming, services and other support to help them succeed. “We work with anyone who is openly LBGTQ, has the ability to succeed in politics, and has a plan for success,” Parker said. There are about 850 LGBTQ people currently serving as elected officials in the U.S, and the Victory Institute is supporting about 300 of those candidates. Army Brig. Gen. Gavin Lawrence, Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support Commander, welcomed Parker as the keynote speaker for this year’s virtual observance. “Despite working remotely, it is still vital for us to come together and observe important events that celebrate our history and diversity,” Lawrence said. This is the 20th year June has been observed as a federally-recognized month of pride. Parker made history when she was elected as mayor of Houston, Texas in 2009, and is the second woman to ever be elected mayor of the city. “Being mayor of my hometown was the greatest job I could possibly have,” Parker said. “The ability to shape the future of the city that shaped me was indescribable. But it took training, it took preparation, it took learning how to really look hard at who I was and what I could offer and what I needed to fix.” The night Parker was elected mayor made worldwide headlines, Parker said. However it wasn’t as big of a deal in Houston because she already served the city as a council member and controller for three two-year terms in each role. “The people of Houston weren’t surprised,” she said. “They already knew me and voted for me.” Getting to the point of being comfortable with campaigning and learning those skills took some time, self-reflection, and hard work, Parker said. Parker received training from the Victory Fund and hired a team of people with the skills she needed to be successful. She also evaluated her strengths and weaknesses, as an introverted person who is “painfully shy,” she had to work at overcoming social anxiety, she said. Parker initially got involved with LGBTQ politics while attending Rice University in the 1970s, where some older members of the gay community introduced her to activism and the changes going on in the country. After college, she went to work in the oil industry in Houston for 20 years, which was 80 percent of the city’s economy during the 1970s, she said. “I had the belief that I could be an activist and do all of my political work on nights and weekends, and then put my business suit on during the day and go to work at the oil company and completely separate the two halves of my life,” she said. “That’s what you did in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s.” After realizing her passions were with her political work, she decided to run for office. She lost her first campaign for the Houston City Council in 1991, and a few years later, she ran and lost again. Before winning her first election, she decided to take control of her image in the media. Parker noticed that when she was mentioned in a news story, she was identified as a “gay activist” first, while her opponents were identified by their job titles. To change that, she said she collected all the news coverage from her first two races and met with the editorial boards of local news outlets. “If you talk about what [my opponents] do as volunteers, it’s great,” Parker said about her meetings with local media. “Talk about what I do as a volunteer. If you talk about what they do for a living, talk about what I do for a living. All I want is to be treated fairly. And the coverage changed.” After winning this election, Parker said she went on to win her next nine consecutive races in Houston. Parker’s anecdotes of her career and contributions resonated with Lawrence’s message to the workforce. “Treating everybody with dignity and respect is a part of our core values, and we do our best to embody those values every day,” Lawrence said. “I am so proud to work with such a diverse and dynamic workforce.”

> PHILADELPHIA – Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support hosted an event in honor of the LGBTQ+ service members and defense department personnel on July 12, 2023, in Philadelphia. Kishayra J. Lambert, DLA Troop Support Deputy commander welcomed the attendees of the event to celebrate the contributions that the LGBTQ+ community has made to American history, society, and culture. “Our diverse talent pool is unquestionably one of our greatest strengths,” said Lambert. “When we foster an environment of respect where all qualified candidates can perform at their highest potential—free from discrimination—it is easier to do our job to support the warfighter’s mission.” Lambert introduced this event’s keynote speaker, Armando Trull, a multiple Emmy award-winning bilingual multimedia communications strategist, who has spent his journalism career covering a wide gamut of issues from hurricanes to refugee camps, and wars to the Olympics. “It’s important to understand that the LGBTQ people in the United States are part of other groups that that did not see themselves as Americans in many ways,” Trull said. “LGBTQ+ people began to see how Black people and women went about the struggle to achieve the promised land of American equality—LGBTQ+ people also wanted to be in that.” Trull continued to highlight that the struggles that LGBTQ+ persons face are not isolated to LGBTQ+ specific issues and that everyone can find common ground on the path towards equality. “I think—as we look at what we want to do now—it's important for us to understand that still, there can be barriers to living openly for LGBTQ+ people,” said Trull. “That's why pride events like this are important, to allow people to hear and to see that this isn't just an isolated thing—that it's happened to other groups.” The defense department’s theme for the 2023 Pride Month of June was: equality without exception. “This June, the Nation celebrated LGBTQ+ Pride month and here at DLA Troop Support we won’t let the year go by without our own contribution,” Lambert said. “Events such as these prove our commitment to diversity and inclusion—of widening freedom, not deepening discrimination—as we strive to serve the greatest fighting force in the world. This event was hosted by DLA Troop Support’s Equal Employment Opportunity Advisory committee in coordination with the Naval Supply Systems Command Weapons Systems Support’s EEOA committee.

> PHILADELPHIA – Fifty years ago, during four hot summer days in New York City’s Greenwich Village, the Stonewall Riots sparked the LGBTQ movement that continues today. More than just a series of fights, marches, protests and arrests, the historic event planted the seeds for the movement of pride, acceptance, equality, visibility and empowerment that is still growing. Jonathan Lovitz, senior vice president of the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce, served as the keynote speaker for the LGBTQ Pride Month Observance June 20 at the Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support in Philadelphia. Stonewall brought together a community that wanted to be treated as regular citizens, no matter their skin color, sexual preference or gender identity. Diversity was at the heart of the movement from the start, Lovitz said. “They were not all cisgender white men under 40, as most people assume the demographic of the gay movement was because of what they’ve seen in the movies,” Lovitz said. “These were men and women of color. These were trans- and gender-nonconforming people. All of these things that are very prevalent now that were just called, ‘those queers at the bar.’ But they got angry, and they fought back.” This began a conversation that led to the Christopher Street Liberation March in 1970, he said. It was the first pride march. This year, pride marches are being held all over the world throughout the month of June. In his role with the NGLCC, Lovitz oversees media relations and public policy, political affairs and strategic partnerships. He said the chamber’s overall role is to help LGBTQ businesses connect with the private and public sector workforce, and to contribute to the U.S. economy. As a news commentator and a public speaker, he said promoting visibility is at the heart of what he does. But, Lovitz noted, the U.S. Census currently does not count the LGBTQ community. “You cannot help people you cannot see,” Lovitz said. “Visibility is key to our movement, but it’s really hard to be visible when you’re not counted.” According to Lovitz, there are 1.4 million LGBTQ business owners in the U.S. who represent $1.7 trillion in gross domestic product. “Our businesses and our economics were something that were never factored into the equality movement,” Lovitz said. “We, the business owners that are in the supply chain, were never included in that dialogue.” If LGBT business owners were their own country, it would be the 10th wealthiest in the world, he said. “They don’t track us on the census, but they sure love the tax dollars,” Lovitz said. Despite 50 years of progress since the Stonewall riots, equal rights and protections are not guaranteed for the LGBTQ community. The Equality Act, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives in May and awaits the Senate’s decision, would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. As a gay man, Lovitz said, he can legally marry his husband in all 50 states, but he can be fired for simply having a photo of him on his desk in 28 of them; 32 if he was transgender. Feeling comfortable in the workplace is a “dollars and cents issue,” Lovitz said. A discrimination-free work environment allows employees to be more productive on the job and happier at home because they aren’t wasting energy being afraid or hiding who they are, he said. The most successful corporations and agencies and places to work put diversity and inclusion as a non-negotiable top priority, he said. “Events like this prove that diversity and inclusion is the right thing to do. It’s the moral thing to do,” Lovitz said. “If you want the best and brightest to work in defending our country, in making its industry work, they have feel empowered to be who they are at work, and they have be empowered to talk and bring their innovation to the field.” DLA Troop Support Deputy Commander Richard Ellis echoed Lovitz’s message on diversity to the Troop Support workforce. “It’s all about diversity. We’re a better organization when we have a diverse workforce,” Ellis said. “Doing the things we need to do, it’s all about having a diverse workforce and being able to get a broad spectrum of ideas to accomplish our mission.”

> PHILADELPHIA – What if the world told you that you don’t exist? Award-winning filmmaker Lauren Lubin posed this question in their 2018 documentary “We Exist: Beyond the Binary.” As someone who didn’t know how to gender identify themselves for years and saw a need to start that conversation, Lubin decided to answer this question on film. Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support and Naval Supply Systems Weapons System Support’s Equal Employment Office Advisory Committees invited Lubin to be the guest speaker at the annual LGBTQ Pride event, held virtually June 9. “I saw film as the perfect medium to confront head-on invisibility and silence,” Lubin said. “Here’s a face, here’s a story, and hopefully for people like myself who had an opportunity to watch the film, they felt like I knew that they existed, and it would give them a moment to feel like they were understood and could be.” In a number of milestones reached for the LGBTQ community, this year marks the 11th anniversary of repealing “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell.” “Throughout our history, brave LGBTQ soldiers, sailors, airmen, coast guardsmen, and Marines have served and fought for our nation,” said Navy Capt. Daniel Norton, director for international programs with NAVSUP WSS. “As we celebrate LGBTQ Pride Month, let us take pride in all who serve.” During the event, Lubin spoke about their own experiences being a nonbinary person, helping others on their own journeys, and continuing to break down barriers for everyone in the LGBTQ community. “The visibility of nonbinary folks and trans folks historically has been next to nothing,” Lubin said. “I put together information for myself and said, ‘oh my gosh,’ there are [nonbinary] people who have always existed all over the world. This is not something that’s new.” Lubin, who uses they/them pronouns, defines nonbinary as people who either identify completely outside the gender binary (male or female) or feel like they possess both and male and female traits. “It’s an umbrella terms for so many different identities that that can fall under it, from gender queer, to agender,” they said. While they easily identified as an athlete, playing Division 1 basketball in college, gender identity was something that didn’t come quite as easily, Lubin said. “My gender identity was something, being assigned female at birth, that never felt cohesive to me,” they said. “It was a long journey for me to get where I even understood that there could be another option for me. But when I did get there, I did recognize…how come nobody is talking about this? I realized at that moment that there needed to be a change.” Getting informed is the best weapon against transphobia and homophobia and breaking down barriers, Lubin said. They encouraged people to research existing resources such as the Human Rights Campaign Lambda Legal, and Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays for more information. “Invest in that education because when you know better, you do better,” they said. Lubin also believes accountability is the best way to work toward change. “People who have the ability to make changes have to be held accountable, they have to hold themselves accountable and others to make changes that will better protect and support the LGBTQ+ community,” Lubin said. “It’s not up to us to protect ourselves always. That’s where the ally-ship really has to come into play.” Anti-LGBTQ jokes or slurs should not be tolerated and are, “not appropriate, and you never know who is closeted around you and how hurtful that could be,” they said. Lubin said to ask someone their gender pronouns because it is a sign of respect, and simply apologize if you use the wrong pronouns and move on. They also stressed the need to provide a “safe space” for children and others who are either coming out or going through their own journey. “Just listen to them and let them talk,” they said. “This is their time for exploration. Give them the space and freedom they need. Be as supportive as possible and check in with them.” Lubin is working to make sure nonbinary people are being represented in more areas, including sports. They were the first-ever openly nonbinary runner to compete in the New York City Marathon in November 2016 and the Boston Marathon in 2019. This fall, Lubin will participate in the Philadelphia Distance Run, the first race in the country to have a nonbinary division in its elite level of competition. “This feels like a very vindicating moment and hopefully the start of others,” said Lubin, who also founded the “We Run” campaign to advocate for equal space and recognition for nonbinary athletes. Lubin said progress is being made for the LGBTQ community, from same sex marriage to repealing “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” in the military, but there is still work to be done. “We can point to so many bench markers, even the most recent [White House] administration stepping up and saying ‘we support trans individuals and the queer community,’” Lubin said. “There’s still a ton of work we still need to do. I don’t want to say that it’s always going to be that way. Everything continues to always evolve. We just have to continually show up and do that work to support each other and keep the progress moving forward.”

LGBTQ Pride Month concluded with Special Emphasis Program [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.dla.mil/About-DLA/News/News-Article-View/Article/2689309/lgbtq-pride-month-concluded-with-special-emphasis-program/)

> COLUMBUS, Ohio – The Defense Federal Community Office of Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity hosted its annual Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Pride Month Special Emphasis Program on June 23. The program was live-streamed from the Defense Supply Center Columbus’ Operations Center Auditorium for associates who were unable to attend. As noted by the Library of Congress, the month of June is designated as LGBTQ Pride Month and just one way to recognize and celebrate the many achievements of the LGBTQ community, which includes members of the Federal workforce. This year’s LGBTQ Special Emphasis Program promoted the theme of “Respect. Dignity. Service. Pride In All Who Serve,” intended to promote the dignity and equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, and queer people in the workforce. Land and Maritime Director of Operations and Executive Champion for the LGBTQ Special Emphasis Program Griff Warren opened the program with remarks highlighting the SEP that featured a discussion panel comprised of three Land and Maritime associates who shared their personal experiences as members of the LGBTQ and federal workforce communities. Warren concluded his remarks by welcoming those in attendance and viewing online and introducing the panelists and moderator for the event. Bethany Darby, customer account specialist for DLA Land and Maritime - Jiwon Han, branch chief for Supplier Operations Research and Analysis Branch in the Business Process Support Directorate and - Jim Wagner, project manager of DLA/USMC Industrial Supply Integration - The panel was moderated by Sheri Kelley, LGBTQ Special Emphasis Program committee member and EEO Disability Program Coordinator for DLA Land and Maritime. Upon taking the stage, Kelley, immediately set the tone for the discussion by stating “the most used pronouns in the English language refer specifically to one’s gender; however, depending on how a person self-identifies, misplaced pronouns can create discomfort, cause stress and anxiety.” Kelley transitioned into the event’s question-and-answer session asking panelists to identify their preferred pronouns before responding to their first question, then asked the panel, “Why would we ask someone their preferred pronoun?” The first question of the event was answered without hesitation by Darby. “I’m Bethany Darby, and I use the preferred pronouns she, her, hers. You may want to ask someone their preferred pronouns because these are the ways we address ourselves as well as others. By asking someone their preferred pronouns you’re asking that person to share a little bit more about themselves with you.” According to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Gender Identity is the individual's internal sense of being male or female or an identity other than the traditional definitions of male or female. The way an individual expresses his or her gender identity is frequently called “gender expression,” and may or may not conform to social stereotypes associated with a particular gender. Gender identity, which is an individual’s internal sense of being male, female or something else, is distinct from sexual orientation, which describes to whom a person is romantically attracted. Most people have a fixed identity as male or female; those who don’t may describe themselves as “non-binary” or “gender queer.” The opening dialogue laid the foundation for the remainder of the event, which consisted of 11 questions with each inviting the audience to discover more about not only the three panelists on stage but an overarching understanding of the LGBTQ community. Kelley’s questions to the panelists were deeply personal and thought-provoking, such as; Have you always been out at work? How long did you wait before you came out in the workplace? Have you experienced any problems or difficulties specifically tied to your LGBTQ orientation or identity? And do you feel your identification as being part of the LGBTQ community has affected your career? “I do feel as if being a member of the LGBTQ community has affected my career,” Han said. “I think it affected my career in a positive way. I had previously served as the LGBTQ SEP chairperson for three years. That experience provided me the opportunity to work directly with the command staff, the EEO office, protocol office and executive champion, allowing me to gain expertise as an action officer. This experience gave me the opportunity to establish transferable skills and then apply those skills to other projects that I managed subsequently. Being out really allowed me to bring my whole self to work. It allowed me to be a better person, a better employee and just be myself.” The panel discussion concluded by Kelley giving a sincere thank you to the panelists taking part in the Pride Month observance, directing those in attendance with any questions to contact the LGBTQ SEP Chair: Robert ‘Scott’ Humphrey via email at: Robert.Humphrey@dla.mil and provided an open invitation to the next LGBTQ SEP committee meeting. “We would love to have your presence at one of the LGBTQ SEP committee meetings. Our committee meetings are open to all members and allies,” Kelley concluded. GLAAD.org states an ally “can merely be someone who is supportive and accepts the LGBT person, or a straight ally can be someone who personally advocates for equal rights and fair treatment. Allies are some of the most effective and powerful voices of the LGBTQ movement. Not only do allies help people in the coming-out process, they also help others understand the importance of equality, fairness, acceptance and mutual respect.” For more information and available resources please visit OPM.gov by clicking here.

> Philly LGBTQ leader speaks at Pride Month event Philadelphia’s executive director of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender affairs said her job is to find commonalities that bring people together. Amber Hikes educated employees at Naval Support Activity Philadelphia on the laws, issues and protections affecting Philadelphia’s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and queer community during a Pride Month program June 28. Hikes described the LGBT Affairs Office as the eyes, ears and voice of this community in City Hall. While explaining the complexities of sexual orientation and gender, in terms of identity, attraction and expression, Hikes provided appropriate terms to address LGBTQ individuals and offensive terms to avoid. “Often we find that people aren’t trying to be rude, they just don’t have the information,” Hikes said. “So part of my job is anticipating that, going out and talking to people and having difficult conversations, and often just having educational conversations.” The Defense Department observed June as LGBT Pride Month with the theme “Pride in All Who Serve.” The Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support and NAVSUP Weapons Systems Support Equal Employment Advisory Committees hosted the program. Navy Capt. Armen Kurdian, NAVSUP WSS engineering and product support director, discussed the progression of DOD Equal Employment Opportunity policy to protect service members and civilians against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. “LGBT individuals in the DOD workforce help us ensure we embody what our country was built upon,” Kurdian said. “The idea that all people are created equal, and that everyone has the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of all things that make us happy.” Hikes described these same ideals locally, as the LGBTQ Affairs office implements policies based on values Philadelphia was founded on, including liberty and justice for all. “I’m proud to say that Philadelphia is one of the most LGBTQ-friendly cities in the entire country,” she said. Hikes discussed ways the office is supporting LGBTQ Philadelphians, including establishing committees to address civil rights, economic empowerment, and health and wellness. The Jazz Feds, a musical ensemble of DLA Troop Support and NAVSUP WSS employees, also performed during the program.

Pride Month Spotlight: Charlie Fulbright [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.dla.mil/About-DLA/News/News-Article-View/Article/3804184/pride-month-spotlight-charlie-fulbright/)

> During the month of June, the Defense Department and DLA are honoring the contributions of all military and civilian personnel with the theme, “Pride in All Who Serve—A Place for All,” which serves as a powerful statement that encapsulates the spirit of unity and acceptance throughout the DOD. Employee Spotlight articles during the month will highlight the mission contributions and personalities of some in the agency who identify as LGBTQ+. Charlie Fulbright is a DLA Logistics Operations program analyst in Battle Creek, Michigan. Can you tell us about yourself? I love to volunteer and be an advocate for those underrepresented. I’ve been a board member of Battle Creek Pride, Battle Creek Historic District Commission, Garden of Dreams Preschool, and am currently a board member of Battle Creek Public Schools and Michigan Association of School Boards. Giving my time to help people in need is my joy. Describe your job in a sentence or two. I work with not only our domestic catalogers, but also our international NATO partners to ensure systems, coding, and policy is correct for everybody. How long have you worked for the federal government or contracting service? Ten years federal government and seven years as a contractor. What is your favorite thing about your line of work? Being able to have good relationships with our colleagues from other nations. What is the best piece of advice someone has given you? Keep fighting and never give up. What do you think about when you hear LGBTQ+ Pride Month? I think of both celebration and remembrance. All my accomplishments regarding anything LGBTQ+ are because someone before me never gave up and kept fighting for what is right. When did you “come out” and was it hard? I came out when I was 16, a sophomore in high school (2001). You would think it was hard, but I had so many friends and family supporting me in my circle. It didn’t get hard until I went into the real world and became an adult. What is one thing you’d like others to know about you being part of the LGBTQ+ community? That I am an emotional, heart-led, loving, dedicated person first, and being gay is just an added bonus. I’ve been with my husband for almost 19 years, and just because I’m gay, it doesn’t mean I’m going to “convert” you. You can’t catch it. Why is it important to you that we celebrate LGBTQ+ Pride Month? Education! We don’t know what we don’t know. Even members of the LGBTQ+ community can learn something new about our history, our sacrifice, and what we have had to overcome. What challenges do LGBTQ+ Americans face today and how can understanding history help us overcome them? I have talked to so many people, specifically straight cisgender males who just don’t know. Education should always be at the forefront of conversation. Nowadays, it has become more political and at a legislative level. We have come a long way from Stonewall, and we are lucky to live in a country where we are not put in jail or even [killed], but it seems like it is a slow move forward. Who’s your biggest influence? My mother. Even though she is not part of the LGBTQ+ community, she is and continues to be my biggest ally. She raised me to believe that everyone matters. Everyone deserves rights, and those of us that have them should fight to share those rights, which I continue to do daily. Tell us something that most people might not know about you. I kinda like playing football. I’m not good, and I don’t like sports, but when I was growing up (pre-coming out), I would play football with the neighborhood kids. What was your first job? Ice cream scooper. What is your best memory of working here? The people! Deploying to Germany and meeting even more DLA employees from Europe who have become friends. I’m a people person. I love interacting with people, I love hearing stories, and I’m pretty sure most people know who I am in the building. What did you want to be when you grew up? A newscaster. Who is your hero? My mom. If you could choose to do anything for a day, what would it be? Become a father (but for more than just one day, LOL). What is your favorite quote? If I can help someone along the way, then my living shall not be in vain. What are your hobbies? Singing, dancing, bowling, game nights, hanging out with friends.

Employee Spotlight articles during the month will highlight the mission contributions and personalities of some in the agency who identify as LGBTQ+. Dan Wimsatt is a data analyst with DLA Logistics Operations in Battle Creek, Michigan. Can you tell us about yourself? I am a retired Air Force officer working for the DLA Logistics Information Services Workload Management Branch. I am the father of five sons and two grandchildren. I love to travel and am looking forward to retiring next year and spending my time relaxing and seeing the world. Describe your job in a sentence or two. I work closely with the catalogers to ensure our workload is being worked expeditiously and troubleshoot any problems that arise with the FLIS portfolio workbench. I am also responsible for creating and maintaining workload reports for both our internal and external customers. How long have you worked for the federal government? I have worked for the government in some capacity for over 40 years. What is your favorite thing about your line of work? Definitely the people I work with. I have met some very dedicated people who love their work and are dedicated to our country and our military members. What is the best piece of advice someone has given you? Treat people with dignity and respect and learn what motivates them. What do you think about when you hear LGBTQ+ Pride Month? That it’s an opportunity to educate people on the contributions LGBTQ people have made to our communities and the struggles we continue to face. When did you “come out” and was it hard? My coming out was a process. Being in the military in the 80s, and 90s, it wasn’t allowed, so I had to hide who I was. So, my coming out was done in stages. First, only to close family and friends who I could trust with my secret, then, after I retired I was able to be more open. Of course, once “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” was repealed, it made it much easier for military members to be true to themselves and serve openly. I remember when Congress voted to repeal DADT, I sat and cried remembering how difficult it was pretending to be something I wasn’t for so many years. It was a great day for America. What is one thing you’d like others to know about you being part of the LGBTQ+ community? That it doesn’t change anything about who I am as a person, I do my job with the same dedication and ability as anyone. It doesn’t define me any differently than being heterosexual defines others. Why is it important to you that we celebrate LGBTQ+ Pride Month? Because it brings awareness to others and gives us the opportunity to celebrate the successes we have made and remind us of the challenges we continue to face. What challenges do LGBTQ+ Americans face today and how can understanding history help us overcome them? Every day we hear about another legislature that is passing some law to restrict our rights. A “Don’t Say ‘Gay’” bill, a book banning, or a school board that refuses to acknowledge a trans student. If we don’t know remember how hard we had to fight to get these rights, we will surely sit back and watch them be taken away. There are many people who would be more than happy to shove us back in the closet. Who’s your biggest influence? I don’t think I can name one person as my biggest influence. Every single person who has stood up and marched, who educated their uninformed relative or coworker, who testified before a state or federal legislature influences me. They are all heroes in my mind. What was your first job? I was a fry cook at a fast-food restaurant. What is your best memory of working here? Before my father died, he had dementia. I was allowed to go to Kentucky one week a month and telework from my parent’s home to help with his care. It spoke volumes about how this organization cares about people. I will never forget that. What did you want to be when you grew up? An accountant. Who is your hero? Harvey Milk and Barack Obama. If you could choose to do anything for a day, what would it be? Be on a beach. What is your favorite quote? That which does not kill us will surely make us stronger. What are your hobbies? DIY projects and woodworking.

> COLUMBUS, Ohio – The Defense Federal Community Office of Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity hosted its annual Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Pride Month Special Emphasis Program June 15. The program was offered in person and via livestream from the Defense Supply Center Columbus’ Operations Center Auditorium for associates who were unable to attend. This year’s theme of “Community, Responsibility and Acceptance,” promoted allyship and inclusion for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, and queer people in the federal workforce at DSCC. The month of June has been set aside by Congress to recognize and celebrate the diversity and accomplishments of the LGBTQ community with parades, festivals and awareness events. Most in-person events were put on pause because of the pandemic but Pride celebrations were back again this year in full force with one of the largest Pride parades in the country taking place in Columbus on June 18. “The congressional measure expresses support for the rights of LGBTQ people and further resolves that LGBTQ rights are human rights and thus protected by the Constitution,” DLA Land and Maritime Director of Operations and Executive Champion for the LGBTQ Special Emphasis Program Griff Warren said in his opening remarks. “It’s not a coincidence that Congress chose June for the celebration of LGBTQ rights. It coincides with the June 1969 Stonewall uprising in New York City which helped to spur the gay rights movement throughout our country and throughout our society,” he added. Warren introduced the event’s three speakers who addressed the three pillars of this year’s theme. Those speakers were: - Robert ‘Scott’ Humphrey, trace audit program coordinator for the Maritime Supplier Operations’ Post-Award team and LGBTQ Special Emphasis Program committee chair representing “Community” - Jiwon Han, branch chief for Supplier Operations Research and Analysis Branch in the Business Process Support Directorate representing “Responsibility” - Sarah Winegardner, chief of the Fluid Handing and the Nuclear Enterprise Support Office Support Division in Maritime Supplier Operations representing “Acceptance” Humphrey emphasized that while the adult community is supportive of LGBTQ people, there is much to do to support youth in their personal coming out journeys. “While the LGBTQ community has been embraced, dare I say popularized, in our modern culture, LGBTQ youth are nearly three times more likely to commit suicide. Many feel unsafe at school and are harassed and bullied. Modern culture may accept and embrace the LGBTQ community but that acceptance is not often felt by children at a time when it is critical for them to be supported to become confident and independent adults,” he said. “Children are often ostracized at school, at home and at places of worship. Pride celebrations are essential to show the younger generation that they are worthy of happiness and love and are accepted for who they are.” Humphrey said Pride celebrations are the most visible way to promote and support the LGBTQ community. “A Pride celebration is a chance to stand in solidarity with a unified voice and declare that one of our community’s greatest strengths is our differences,” he added. And they help motivate youth to actively take action and participate in the greater LGBTQ community. “More than half of LGBTQ youth say they are motivated to help others. Let’s make sure they have the power to do that,” he said. Allyship is key. According to the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation an ally is anyone who supports the LGBTQ community. GLAAD states on their website “Allies are some of the most effective and powerful voices of the LGBTQ movement. Not only do allies help people in the coming-out process, they also help others understand the importance of equality, fairness, acceptance and mutual respect.” Sometimes the journey to true allyship is not as simple as flying a Pride flag, attending a Pride celebration or donating to the nearest LGBTQ charity, sometimes it can be a lifelong journey. For Winegardner acceptance was a large part of her journey in becoming an ally to the LGBTQ people in her life, especially for her daughter, AJ, who came out on her front porch with the active support and allyship of their friends as she arrived home from work one day. “AJ being gay is not what set me back for a moment,” she said. “It was this beautiful picture in front of me of all these girls ready to embrace my daughter if I did not.” Which she did. She said she immediately went up and hugged AJ and “told them that I loved them…and then I offered everyone snacks.” How she became aware that she needed to be an ally, of looking to foster acceptance in all spheres of her life did not start with her daughter coming out. It actually started back in her childhood when acceptance was not given at a family Christmas gathering when she was about 13 years old. She overheard a very negative and unaccepting conversation several of her family members were having about an older cousin who had just come out. She mentioned that this was her first real disappointment in her family. Some with their lack of acceptance and some with their not speaking up louder that he was still family, that he was still loved, that he was still accepted. This reaction came from the environment she grew up in: a rural and conservative small town surrounded by farm fields. Gay was not talked about or if it was it was a joke, a slur or a whisper, she said. While Winegardner did not participate in these jokes she didn’t realize that this was just like that gathering in her family’s kitchen. That it was a place where being unwelcomed was vocalized and acceptance was really quiet and often whispered. When a friend she had known all through childhood came out in college it dawned on her that the culture at her school was just as damning as it was in her family’s kitchen. She realized that acceptance and allyship could not be whispered. That it needed to be proclaimed and given its space. That’s when she started becoming an active ally. So active that she went overboard in her acceptance of AJ’s choice by buying a Pride flag, matching Pride earrings, joining Pride groups among other activities thinking she was being a good ally when in fact she was creating an environment that was not accepting. After a conversation with AJ, they created a shared space for acceptance. She said she finally learned how acceptance is more than just being open and loving but “it’s also recognizing that acceptance needs to be on the terms of the person who is asking for it.” When AJ came out to Winegardner’s family, it was met with love and acceptance this time and not the silence and cynicism of that kitchen long ago. “Acceptance is a story of how we evolve, how acceptance evolves, and how acceptance isn’t just us making internal decisions, but is us helping to create and celebrate within spaces that others have helped define to empower them,” she said. According to the Human Rights Campaign, being an ally is one of the most important things one can do to support the LGBTQ community. “There is an amazing power of being a Straight ally of the LGBTQ community. By simply showing up to support sends a powerful message of love and acceptance and a message of reassurance that LGBTQ+ people are embraced and supported by their community,” Humphrey said. Taking responsibility whether it be as an ally or as a member within the LGBTQ community is also important. Han spoke about her personal journey into taking responsibility and why that matters. She said that when she hears about responsibility, her mind goes to representation. “Representation matters because visibility matters,” she said. Han emphasized that sexual orientation and gender identity is not something that we easily identify within a person. And that is why with the LGBTQ community, coming out is such an important and powerful act. Han felt it was her responsibility to represent the LGBTQ community soon after the Land and Maritime LGBTQ Special Emphasis Program was formed in 2015 by stepping up and serving as the LGBTQ chairperson from 2016 to 2018. “I knew that in order for me to have the kind of representation I wanted, I needed to step up, and be that representation. I saw this as an opportunity to support my community,” she said. She said that stepping up to lead the program was a difficult decision for her at the time, because she was not out to her colleagues. “But recalling how I felt when I first came out to myself, motivated me to make that my responsibility,” Han said. “And because I am able to bring my whole self to work, I am able to have meaningful relationships with my colleagues and share my life with them.” She cited a recent example of that openness by sharing to the audience that she got married over the Memorial Day weekend to her wife, Jess, receiving cheers and applause from all in the room. “I was truly moved by the overwhelming support that I received from my work family who celebrated with me,” she said. Such a supportive environment didn’t always exist within the federal government. Han said if a person came out in the 1950s and 60s, they would lose their job as a civil servant and during the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy, thousands of service members were also unfairly discharged. She mentioned that the federal government has made great progress in advancing LGBTQ representation, citing that about five percent of the federal workforce identify as LGBTQ and about 14 percent of current political appointees also identify as LGBTQ including two prominent cabinet members. “Representation matters because visibility matters and visibility matters because it helps us to understand one another,” she said. “As we celebrate our seventh annual Pride month event here at Land and Maritime, I’d like to encourage all of you to take on the responsibility of representation and to embrace and accept each other as a community.” Anyone can be an ally. You do not have to have someone in the family or know someone who identifies as LGBTQ to support the community. The Human Rights Campaign has a great downloadable resource, “Being a LGBTQ Ally”, that explains what it is to be an ally, how to support someone coming out, definitions and more. Local resources include Stonewall Columbus, Equality Ohio and the Columbus Chapter of P-FLAG. Other groups and links to national resources can also be found on the Stonewall Columbus website. Defense Finance and Accounting Service – Columbus Site Director Pamela Franceschi closed the program remarking on how important special emphasis programs are in learning about the struggles and experiences of others and how important it is to accept and create safe spaces for celebration and collaboration. DLA Land and Maritime Customer Account Specialist Bethany Darby served as the event host and Army veteran Mark Cooke performed the National Anthem. Also in attendance was DLA Land and Maritime Acquisition Executive Mark Brown and DLA Land and Maritime Chief of Staff U.S. Air Force Col. Christopher Tooman.
