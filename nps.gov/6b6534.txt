The Pride Guide is an interactive resource for exploring lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) history and places in the United States. Working through the Pride Guide gives you an opportunity to learn new things, but it should also inspire you to socialize with others while listening to their thoughts and perspectives. Intended for teenagers and gay-straight alliances, this resource can also be used by adults and communities interested in learning more about the topic material. The Pride Guide may also be used by teachers to meet state standards and requirements for inclusive curricula. Gather a group of friends or peers when using The Pride Guide as the discussion questions and activities are meant to be completed with others.
