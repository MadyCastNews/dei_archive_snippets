What do your Two Spirit and LGBTQ patients need from you? Our Two Spirit and LGBTQ+ relatives may forego healthcare when clinicians and clinical environments are not affirming. Furthermore, traumatic experiences with discrimination and invisibilization in clinical settings can prevent our communities from accessing both life-saving preventative and gender-affirming care. Check out the following resources in order to help guide the critical work of creating affirming clinical spaces for all. Ensure your clinical and community environments are affirming for all clients, especially those who identify as trans or gender-diverse, by accessing tips, tools, and sample policies in our Trans & Gender-Affirming Care Strategic Vision and Action Plan (SVAP). First disseminated in 2020, this 2.0 is a 2024 release. Our 2020 SVAP was supported by the NPAIHB Tribal Delegates via resolution, and this is a newly updated version of that plan. Please complete this form if you’d like support implementing any aspect of this plan.
