As you prepare for graduate, professional school or job interviews, you may be asked a question related to diversity. Interviewers are very interested in selecting candidates who are aware of and who will contribute to the diversity mission of their organization. Have you practiced how you will answer diversity-related questions? In Career Services, we have seen trainees range in their comfort level about addressing diversity topics. Some trainees have several experiences to answer these questions, that saidâ€”many others are unsure how to approach answering the question. In 2014, to recognize Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) Pride month, the OITE Careers Blog published a post addressing job search and work environments for LGBTQ scientists called Happy Pride! This blog issue provides useful resources for scientists, their families, and allies in support of inclusive career decision-making and work environments.
