Presents a comprehensive overview of issues facing LGBTQ students in higher education in the US and those seeking to ‘queer the academy’ through incorporating LGBTQ content into curricula. It highlights unanticipated problems such as a closeted gay man being harassed by those who are more ‘out’, and faculty and staff telling students not to list a certificate in LGBTQ studies on a resume. Additionally, the resource provides proven strategies to create affirming institutions of higher learning in which students and faculty can be their full selves and study the contributions of LGBTQ people to the human experience.
