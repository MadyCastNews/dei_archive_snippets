Juveniles in Residential Placement, 2013 NCJ 249507 Since 1997, OJJDP has sponsored the U.S. Census Bureau to conduct the Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement. This survey details the characteristics of youth held for delinquency and status offenses in public and private residential facilities in every state. The data provide a detailed picture of these youth, including their age, gender, race, offenses, and adjudication status. The 2013 census shows that the number of youth in placement continues to decline. In 1997, 105,055 youth were held in out-of-home placement. Although the number of youth in confinement increased 4 percent between 1997 and 1999, by 2013, that number had decreased 50 percent to 54,148, its lowest level. Relative declines from 1997 to 2013 were greater for committed youth than for detained youth. View and download this bulletin and accompanying data snapshot. Child Victims of Stereotypical Kidnappings Known to Law Enforcement in 2011 NCJ 249249 This bulletin summarizes findings on the incidence and characteristics of stereotypical kidnappings of children in 2011 and compares them with 1997 findings. An estimated 105 children were victims of stereotypical kidnappings in 2011, virtually the same as the 1997 estimate. Most kidnappings involved the use of force or threats, and about three in five victims were sexually assaulted, abused, or exploited. Victims were, most commonly, ages 12 to 17, girls, white, and living in situations other than with two biological or adoptive parents. Half of all stereotypical kidnappings in 2011 were sexually motivated crimes against adolescent girls. Most perpetrators of 2011 stereotypical kidnappings were male, were ages 18 to 35, and were white or black in equal proportions. View and download this bulletin. Creating and Sustaining Fair and Beneficial Environments for LGBTQ Youth: OJJDP Listening Session Report NCJ 245321 OJJDP Listening Session Reports This report summarizes the information, ideas, and perspectives that were shared at an OJJDP-sponsored listening session on improving the care of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth who are involved, or at risk of becoming involved, in the juvenile justice system. Participants in the November 2014 listening session included researchers, practitioners, and youth experts from across the nation. Recommendations offered throughout the session were designed to lay the foundation for a strategic framework composed of actionable items that OJJDP can take to address the unique needs of LGBTQ youth, help state and localities develop appropriate policies and practices, develop interagency agreements with other federal partners, leverage and enhance OJJDPâ€™s current training and technical assistance, and encourage research to identify promising programs for this special population.
