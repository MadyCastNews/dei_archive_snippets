Award Information Description of original award (Fiscal Year 2021, $300,000) The project title is Addressing hate crime/bias-motivated crime with education and awareness. The Richmond Police Department (RPD) requests consideration of $300,000 in support of the BJA FY 21 Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Program. This funding (for 36 months) will allow the RPD to coordinate training, education, and awareness of hate crimes toward the LGBTQ+ community and a variety of strategies and partners to achieve the goals and objectives of this program. In partnership with Virginia Anti-Violence Project (VAVP), RPD intends to use the funding to train and educate law enforcement, community members, local colleges and universities, and community partners on hate crimes/bias-motivated crimes but most importantly underreported hate crimes and the lack of trust the LGBTQ+ community has for agencies created to protect them. For more than five years, RPD has demonstrated its concern for the LGBTQ+ community through its partnership with VAVP and has represented law enforcement at community meetings; however, the need to extend our representation as a law enforcement agency goes beyond our physical presence. Hate crimes towards the LGBTQ+ community go unreported daily. Coupled with minimal training and awareness, RPD recognizes the need to fully support underserved populations. We can continue this work with grant funding, community partnerships, and support.
