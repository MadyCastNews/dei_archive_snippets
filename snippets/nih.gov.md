50 Years After Stonewall, Celebrating Progress and Striving for LGBTQ Health Equity [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://blog.nimhd.nih.gov/archives-2019/news_feed/50-years-after-stonewall-celebrating-progress-and-striving-for-lgbtq-health-equity)

> By Brian Mustanski, Ph.D. Director, Institute for Sexual and Gender Minority Health and Wellbeing Co-Director, Third Coast Center for AIDS Research Co-Director, Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology Professor, Department of Medical Social Sciences Northwestern University Member, National Advisory Council on Minority Health and Health Disparities In June 1969, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community led historic riots against discriminatory police raids of the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village. The Stonewall riots galvanized the LGBTQ community to come together in a nationwide movement in pursuit of equality. Growing up as a young gay man in Minnesota, I had no knowledge of Stonewall. With the Internet still in its infancy, there were limited resources to learn about the LGBTQ community. I resorted to secretly reading my high school encyclopedia’s entry on “homosexuality,” which that edition still described as a psychiatric disorder. Media coverage of homosexuality was dominated by the emerging AIDS crisis. I often heard people say, “AIDS is God’s punishment.” With no access to alternative information, it was hard to reject these messages. Years later, I began pursuing a career in science. My undergraduate faculty mentor warned me not to “come out,” as it could hurt my chances of graduate admission. Evidence is just emerging on how sexual and gender minority (SGM) people experience structural and interpersonal barriers to STEM careers.1 In graduate school, I was heavily impacted by a report showing that the majority of SGM teens came out online before they did in the “real world.”2 This information emerged alongside evidence of alarmingly high HIV prevalence among young gay and bisexual men.3 It was then that I realized that the Internet might be the only way to reach this group with resources and education at a critical point: before they may be at risk of HIV. e-Health approaches to HIV prevention have continued to be a major focus of my research—particularly with young gay and bisexual men, among whom HIV diagnoses continue to increase.4 In 2018, my team published the first study to show significant effects of an e-Health HIV prevention program on a biomedical outcome (sexually transmitted infections),5 and we’re studying implementation of the program nationally.6 With support from NIMHD, my team is studying a package of developmentally adapted e-Health HIV prevention programs for teenage gay/bisexual boys.6 Both projects are simultaneously studying implementation and effectiveness to quickly move evidence into practice.7 HIV research on gay/bisexual men represents the majority of NIH funding for SGM health.8 But research on the entire SGM community is critical if we are going to remediate health disparities. For example, despite being at increased risk, lesbian and bisexual women are less likely to receive cancer screenings.9 Transgender people are more likely to be uninsured, experience rampant discrimination in health care settings, and delay care as a result of that stigma.10 These aren’t just disturbing statistics—they are devastating realities. At the root of this inequity is the same discrimination that the Stonewall activists rioted against 50 years ago. We are only beginning to uncover how prejudice and discrimination “get under the skin,”11 with toxic effects on SGM health. That’s not to say we haven’t seen progress. SGM representation in STEM disciplines is becoming more of a priority. My academic home, Northwestern University, appointed me as director of the first university wide institute focused exclusively on SGM health and well-being (ISGMH). In 2016, through the leadership of NIMHD Director Dr. Pérez-Stable, the National Institutes of Health formally recognized our community as a health disparity population for research purposes, opening up new doors for research funding. But movement often feels like two steps forward and one step back. SGM-focused data collection, which is critical to understanding the health needs of our community, may be discontinued from federal surveys. Our online outreach is increasingly met with hateful messages (e.g., “You deserve extermination”) that we have never seen at this frequency before. The Healthy People 2020 report ended on a powerful conclusion—that “understanding LGBT health starts with understanding the history of oppression and discrimination that these communities have faced.” This Pride Month, 50 years after Stonewall, we’ll reflect on that history and celebrate our resilience. We’ll also continue to push forward and commit to continuing to advance SGM health equity. References 1 Freeman, J. (2018). LGBTQ scientists are still left out.

> By Jeremy T. Goldbach, Ph.D., LMSW Associate Professor Chair, USC Social Behavioral Institutional Review Board Director, Center for LGBT Health Equity Pronouns: He/Him University of Southern California Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work I remember it like yesterday. I stepped into the small, cramped meeting room of a local LGBTQ drop-in center. The room served triple duty as a social milieu, computer lab, and meeting room. Posters and homemade art covered the walls, displayed proudly everywhere the eye could see like wallpaper, almost demanding inspiration and hope from passive onlookers. The warm room, paired with the anxiety that no title or position can ever seem to overcome, made my hands clammy. I had arrived seeking feedback on an intervention we had been developing for nearly a decade. Bracing myself for the brutal honesty only found in adolescence, I opened the floor. “So, what do you think?” Silence. I thought back to my lessons on pedagogy—it takes people an average of seven seconds to respond to a question, Jeremy. Relax. One … Two … Three. More silence. I could feel my carpe diem moment slipping away, so I looked awkwardly to the posters for solace and inspiration. “Well—.” Someone finally spoke. Relief. “We talked a bit before this meeting, and we are trying to understand. Why do you only seem to want to talk about the bad things that happen to us, when there is so much good, too? We come to this center to be affirmed. I mean, look around—it’s literally all over the walls.” They pointed to the posters I had sought refuge in earlier, which now seemed to mock me. I didn’t know how to answer. I had spent my entire career to this point so focused on the disparities that LGBTQ+ youth experience, it was difficult to even begin to consider the good things in their lives. Indeed, my own work (and that of many others) has found copious evidence of the stigmatizing, discriminatory, and violent experiences these youth encounter every day and the resulting impact on their health. Like many others, I have drawn on my own experiences growing up a gay kid who was told that being gay meant never being happy and probably dying a lonely death (a narrative I still write at times). But they were right. Despite all the negative and heartbreaking things we have been programmed to study in this deficit-based world, there are good people out there: parents, teachers, mentors, and even school systems trying to make a difference and pass good policies to protect LGBTQ+ youth and enhance their health and well-being. The problem is, we’ve spent so much time trying to understand the things that do damage, we still know almost nothing about the programs, practices, and policies that promote resilience and safety. Our research on the effects of the COVID-19-related quarantine show this, too. Although many young people in our studies did report difficulty in family relationships and isolation from supportive peers, this wasn’t always the case. Many described being home as a reprieve from their challenging experiences at school, where the safety of their family (and ready access to a private restroom) ensured they could avoid navigating a highly stressful learning environment. As one youth told us recently, “Me and my family…have been taking walks every other day or so. I think I’ve actually gotten closer to my parents from this.” Similarly, in meetings with local schools, one superintendent said, “We want to support our students, but someone has to tell us how!” So, the question remains: how do we learn from these unprecedented times, not only to confirm what is wrong in the world, but also to explore what is right? For my sake, at least, I’m trying to regularly remind myself that although it is true that LGBTQ+ youth need support when they experience stigma, violence, and victimization, life is not all bad. Youth live in a dynamic world now, where stress and resilience commingle to create the fabric of their lives. And to support them in their journey, we need to understand all facets of their experience—certainly the painful and difficult ordeals, but also the life-affirming, wholesome, and supportive moments that bring them joy and hope.

Striving Towards Health Equity: Understanding the Impact of Discrimination on LGBTQ+ Communities [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://blog.nimhd.nih.gov/archives-2022/news_feed/striving-towards-health-equity-understanding-the-impact-of-discrimination-on-lgbtq-communities)

> Striving Towards Health Equity: Understanding the Impact of Discrimination on LGBTQ+ Communities Posted on Updated June 27, 2022 By Eliseo J. Pérez-Stable, M.D. Director, National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities For Pride Month, learn how NIMHD is working to understand health disparities that impact SGM populations Sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations, including those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ+)1, experience health disparities and face barriers to accessing health care. SGM populations have higher burdens of certain diseases, such as depression, certain cancers, and tobacco-related conditions. But the extent and causes of health disparities are not fully known, mechanisms remain unclear, and more research on how to close these gaps is needed. Stigmatization, hate-related violence, and discrimination are still major barriers to the health and well-being of SGM populations. Research shows that sexual and gender minorities who live in communities with high levels of anti-SGM prejudice die sooner—12 years on average—than those living in more accepting communities. SGM individuals who are also from racial, ethnic, and/or immigrant minority communities may be even more vulnerable because they face similar barriers, discrimination, and health challenges that are unique to those experienced by all minority populations. The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) is dedicated to understanding the effects of these complex and dynamic intersections and supports research on the role discrimination plays in SGM health disparities. For example, in a recently published study, NIMHD researchers examined whether race and ethnicity influenced any associations that may exist between sexual minority status and substance use (tobacco, cannabis, and alcohol) disorders. Overall, sexual minority adults showed a higher prevalence of substance use and disorders. Racial and ethnic minority individuals who were bisexual showed an even stronger association than heterosexuals. In addition, African American or Black bisexual persons were more than twice as likely to be using tobacco. These results underscore the importance of studying the intersectionality of race and ethnicity with sexual orientation, and the need for increased screening and treatment of substance use disorders among sexual minority adults, especially those from racial and ethnic minority groups. While NIMHD continues to delve into the factors of health disparities experienced by SGM populations, large gaps in the understanding of SGM health continue to persist, in part, due to the lack of adequate, consistent, and standardized data collection of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and sexual behavior in research studies, administrative records, surveillance databases, and clinical settings. The “Don’t Ask, Don’t Know” approach to SGM populations has been a challenge in health care and clinical research. In recent years standardized sexual orientation and gender identity questions have been increasingly incorporated into epidemiological surveys and in electronic health records, so that the era of hidden from sight is ending for SGM populations in clinical and public health studies. In addition, the National Institutes of Health Sexual & Gender Minority Research Office, NIMHD, and 17 other components of the agency commissioned a recently published study, “Measuring Sex, Gender Identity, and Sexual Orientation.” This report serves as an important cornerstone for the scientific community to enhance its data collection and improve measurements to fully reflect community experiences and recognize the diversity of the SGM population. With enhanced sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data collection, researchers can better track health outcomes and develop tailored prevention strategies, interventions, and treatments to ultimately improve the health and well-being of SGM individuals across the nation. We now ask and will learn to reduce disparities in the SGM community. NIMHD envisions an America in which all populations will have an equal opportunity to live long, healthy, and productive lives. By understanding biological, behavioral, environmental, cultural, and structural components that affect SGM health, as well as the role clinical care can play, we can best address health disparities and identify interventions that improve the overall health of the SGM community. ### 1 Sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations include, but are not limited to, individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, transgender, Two-Spirit, queer, and/or intersex. Individuals with same-sex or -gender attractions or behaviors and those with a difference in sex development are also included. These populations also encompass those who do not self-identify with one of these terms but whose sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or reproductive development is characterized by non-binary constructs of sexual orientation, gender, and/or sex.

> Advancing Evidence-Based Interventions to Improve Access to Mental Health Services for LGBTQ+ Youth Transcript TAMARA LEWIS-JOHNSON: Welcome to the 2021 National Institute of Mental Health LGBTQ Mental Health Webinar entitled Advancing Evidence-Based Interventions to Improve Access to Mental Health Services for LGBTQ+ Youth. My name is Tamara Lewis Johnson and I am the point of contact for non-HIV Sexual Gender Minority Research at the Office for Disparities Research and Workforce Diversity at the National Institute of Mental Health. I am responsible for providing advice and guidance on matters related to sexual and gender minority mental health research. The National Institute of Mental Health recognizes that more mental health research involving sexual gender minority populations is essential to gain a better understanding of the complex factors impacting the well-being and mental health needs of sexual and gender minority individuals and to reduce the mental health disparities experienced by many in that community. This afternoon we are spotlighting the research of Drs. Emily Feinberg, Sarabeth Broder-Fingert, Tania Israel, and Miya Barnett. This research was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health’s Division of Services and Implementation Research. Significant mental health disparities exist for LGBQT+ youth as a result of frequent discrimination and a lack of support from family members and society. To improve mental health outcomes, it is important to understand how LGBTQ+ youth of color and their families negotiate intersecting identities, manage stigma, and discrimination and develop or utilize social support systems. And now, a little bit about the speakers. I will introduce them as they will be presenting this afternoon. The first is Dr. Tania Israel. She is a Professor in the Department of Counseling, Clinical, and School Psychology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Her scholarship focuses on interventions to support the mental health and well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer individuals and communities. Her research focuses on privilege and oppression, intersections among gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, and social justice. She has received honors for her research and advocacy from the American Psychological Association, the California Asian and Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus, and her local LGBTQ community. Next is Dr. Emily Feinberg. She is the Associate Professor at Boston University School of Medicine. She received her doctorate from Harvard School of Public Health and her MSN in Parent-Child Nursing from Simmons College and her bachelors from Boston University. She is trained clinically as a pediatric nurse practitioner and continues to see patients at Dothouse Health, a federally qualified community health center in Boston’s Dorchester neighborhood. The focus of her research is improving systems of care for vulnerable children with complex conditions. She has a background in maternal and child health with specific training in the conduct of community-based experimental studies. Then I am introducing Dr. Sarabeth Broder-Fingert. She is the Associate Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. She is a nationally recognized expert in implementation autism research and a passionate and successful mentor of junior investigators. As a researcher and clinician, for the past 12 years, she has been working to develop and test novel interventions to improve the lives of vulnerable children. At the same time, she has been studying how and why certain innovations are widely disseminated and implemented, while others are not. Dr. Broder-Fingert has a successful track record of developing, testing, implementing, and disseminating novel interventions to improve care for young adults. And then last but not least is Dr. Miya Barnett. She is the Assistant Professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara in the Department of Counseling, Clinical, and School Psychology. She runs the Promoting Access through Dissemination and Implementation Research on Evidence-based Services Lab and Parent-Child Interaction Therapy Clinic. Her research is focused on how implementation science can address mental health service disparities for ethnic minority children and families. She is specifically focused on how lay health workers can be mobilized to increase access to evidence-based practices for underserved communities. The investigators will have approximately one hour to present their findings. And then we will take questions from the viewers. You may submit a question at any time during this presentation by sending it to the Q&A box at the bottom of the screen. I will share your questions with speakers and give them an opportunity to respond. The Q&A will follow the full presentation. And now just a few more housekeeping notes. Participants, as you are here, you are muted and in silent-only mode and your cameras are turned off. As I said earlier, please submit your questions via the Q&A box at any time during the presentation. If you have any technical difficulties, hearing or viewing the webinar, please note these in the Q&A box and our technicians will work to fix the problem. You can also send an email to events@1sourceevents.com. This webinar and all other webinars in this series will be recorded and posted on the website for later viewing in approximately one month. Please allow me to introduce Dr. Tania Israel. TANIA ISRAEL: Hello. I want to say first of all a huge thank you to NIMH for inviting us to present on this important topic. We will be sharing some overview of the issue in terms of mental health disparities and community health workers and then we will share some findings from a current project that we are working on. Sexual minority, which we mean lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, questioning or otherwise non-heterosexual youth face notable challenges, including higher rates of mental health concerns than their heterosexual peers. In the Trevor Project’s 2021 survey of nearly 35,000 sexual and gender minority youth, ages 13 to 24, 72 percent of LGBTQ youth reported symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder in the past two weeks. Sixty-two percent of LGBTQ youth reported symptoms of major depressive disorder in the past two weeks. And the 9 percent of cisgender or non-transgender youth and 18 percent of transgender youth had been subjected to conversion therapy and those who had been subjected to conversion therapy had twice the rate of suicide attempts compared to those who had not. Forty-two percent of LGBTQ youth seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year, including more than half of transgender and gender non-binary youth. When we look at actual suicide attempts, 12 percent of white and Asian American LGBTQ youth attempted suicide compared with higher rates of youth of color. Only one in three LGBTQ youth found their home to be LGBTQ affirming. As we know, people have been home a lot in the past year and a half. That has been particularly stressful during COVID. And nearly half of LGBTQ youth reported that they wanted counseling from a mental health professional, but that they were unable to receive it in the past year. As you can see, there are considerable risks for LGBTQ youth in terms of mental health. Let us talk a little about parental support. Parents of sexual minority youth may lack information about sexual orientation. They might also know few sexual minority individuals and they might hold prejudices towards sexual minorities. Consequently, they may be demonstrating some unsupportive behaviors. As you know, parents are very influential in children’s lives and especially with people at home so much. It is important that we understand what are some of the things that might be going on. In terms of parental behavior, some of those unsupportive behaviors are verbally rejecting a child’s sexual orientation. Sexual orientation change efforts, also known as conversion therapy. Also, parents suggesting that a child’s identity is pathological or is just a phase. Parents may discourage a child from coming out and they may avoid discussions related to sexual orientation. These are behaviors that have been identified by youth as particularly unsupportive. When parents do these unsupportive behaviors, it is associated with the youth depression, suicidality, low self-esteem, and substance use, including alcohol, tobacco, and other substances. There are things that parents can do to express support. Parents of all children can express support generally by conveying love and warmth, by doing enjoyable activities with their child, and by fostering a relationship where communication is more likely to happen. Those are things where all parents of any youth, sexual and gender minority or not. But in addition, parental supports specific to sexual and gender minority youth can include certain things, including talking openly about sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and identity exploration. Also, helpful is acknowledging the presence of heterosexism. Connecting one’s child with LGBTQ media and community so they are not isolated. Validating a child’s romantic relationships. Welcoming a child’s LGBTQ friends into one’s home. Encouraging acceptance among family members and advocating for inclusive school and religious environments. And educating themselves and processing their experience as a child of a sexual minority child but doing away from the child so that they can have all of their reactions and emotions without the child needing to support that or be exposed to potentially negative messages. It turns out that parental support is then a protective factor and high levels of parental support are associated with decreased depression, anxiety, substance use so the same things that we saw as elevated when there is lack of support or unsupportive behaviors. But also, parental support can be protective against risky sexual behavior, psychological distress, and also suicidality. One finding from the Trevor Project study that stands out in terms of the impact of parental support for gender minority youth in particular is that transgender and gender non-binary youth, who reported having their pronounces respected by all of the people they lived with, attempted suicide at only half the rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected by anyone with whom they lived. That is one very concrete way that parents can demonstrate support of gender minority youth is using their pronouns. We also know that adjusting to being a parent of a sexual or gender minority child is a process that parents may not initially demonstrate those supportive behaviors because they might need to educate themselves. They might need to gain knowledge. They might need to process what it is like to have a sexual or gender minority child and they might also need to navigate their concerns around a child’s safety or happiness. For some parents, they may experience a sense of loss for what they believe to be their child’s sexual orientation or gender. Parents typically do become more supportive of their child’s sexual orientation or gender identity over time. But sexual and gender minority youth may benefit from getting that support at an earlier point. In sum about parental support, parents can be sources of stigma or support. Parental support is an important factor in sexual and gender minority youth mental health. And parents may be struggling especially early in their own adjustment process. What about the role of culture? Experiences of sexual and gender minority youth and parents may differ based on cultural considerations. Notably, whereas children from other kinds of minority groups like racial or religious minority groups generally receive parental affirmation of their minority status and support based on shared group experiences so parents of color who are raising children of color probably have some shared experiences around racism that they can help their child to learn to deal with. But sexual and gender minority youth are typically the offspring of cisgender heterosexual parents who may be uncertain about how to support a sexual or gender minority child. We know that there are differences in some mental health risks by ethnicity. I mentioned before suicidality. This is from the Trevor Project study. Suicide attempts by ethnicity. White and Asian American youth attempt suicide 12 percent of sexual and gender minority youth. But you can see that that is higher for Latinx youth, black youth, multiracial youth, and especially Native American youth up to 31 percent. There are those kinds of differences that we see. Why is this? In addition to discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, LGBTQ youth of color experience discrimination based on race or ethnicity. And the more types of discrimination youth experience, the higher their risk for suicidality. We also see some very specific things going on in terms of parental rejection. Parental rejection is higher among Latinx and black parents compared to white parents. It is mediated by homonegativity so the more homonegativity, the more negative toward LGBT people the parents are, the more likely they are to reject their child. Parental rejection is associated with cultural values that emphasize traditional gender roles. Parents of sexual and gender minority youth may be struggling especially when cultural values conflict. Support may also look different for different parents based on culture. For example, expressions of sexual orientation may be culturally influenced. In some cultures, there may be more overt naming of sexual orientation and in others, there may be what we might called tacit subjectivity, which is when there might be a demonstration of sexual orientation or gender identity through behaviors or bringing a partner home, but not actually naming it verbally and that that is more common and more acceptable in some cultures than others. There are also some opportunities for parents. Parental experience can help to prepare children for discrimination and how to deal with discrimination and how to identify discrimination. That can be protective if parents have experienced some types of discrimination, for example, racial and they can help their child to understand how to deal with discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity or expression. You can also build on cultural values, for example, around family and the importance of family support and acceptance. And, again, support may look different in various cultural contexts. It is very important that we find ways of supporting people that are consistent with or coherent in their cultural context. What about intervention? What do we actually want to do to help support sexual and gender minority youth and their parents? Because youth are impacted by their environments, it is important intervene at that level rather than just focus on individual interventions directed at youth. There are organizations like PFLAG that involve peer support among parents of sexual and gender minority youth. However, PFLAG groups predominantly serve white parents in urban areas so they may not adequately be reaching racial minority and rural populations. There are other things that maybe helpful with that. There is the parent support program developed by Dr. Em Matsuno and there is also the PRISMS intervention by Dr. Josh Goodman. These are online so they increase access. They do not necessarily reach all parents and also because they are online interventions, they are a little bit more challenging to individualize. We need interventions that are community based, that are tailored for specific and historically marginalized communities. We also need culturally relevant interventions. We need a model for how to develop interventions that work within one community and that can help us to think about how to do this in other communities too. We may not be able to go broadly initially. We may want to target some specific communities and then figure out how that does or does not generalize to other communities. I am now going to pass off the presentation to Dr. Feinberg. EMILY FEINBERG: Thank you, Dr. Israel, for a great introduction. I think you have really highlighted the opportunities that the models that we will be discussing can have to support LGBTQ youth and their families. I will be changing course a bit and providing background on models to address service disparities, specifically looking at family navigation and promotoras. Both promotoras and navigators all within the sphere of community health worker models of care collectively the individuals who provide these services are often called lay health workers in that there is no single educational pathway that defines the role. But community health worker models of care share a common foundation. The individuals who deliver the service whether a person is called a community health worker, navigator, family partner, or promotora share common social attributes to the population served. Some examples are that they live in similar communities. They share racial, ethnic, linguistic background. And they may have similar lived experience, for example, a child with a disability or a history of substance use disorder. In all cases, they leverage their social proximity to the communities served to bridge services. And those services may be linkage to mental health services or more broader social needs. I am going to speak specifically about family navigation, which is the model that I have most experience with. The goal of family navigation is to support families in overcoming structural and psychological obstacles. It might be transportation, language, fear, or stigma in order to reduce disparities in access to care and engagement in recommended services. Family navigation is rooted in the chronic care model and shares the basic tenets of patient navigation from which it was derived. You may be familiar with patient navigation. It was originally targeted to individual patients with cancer risk. It focused on a period from suspicious screening result through diagnostic ascertainment and engagement in recommended services. But sometimes it is called the discovery to diagnosis disconnect. Its use has expanded to other conditions and currently addresses a range of areas to care. Similar to the original navigation model, family navigation focuses on the period beginning with an identified concern that requires follow up and expands the model to engage the entire family unit rather than a patient. Navigators provide time-limited family support and education, community outreach and linkage to services. Our work originally focused on support to families of children identified as having an increased likelihood of autism and has expanded more broadly to children and youth with behavioral concerns who live in communities affected by structural racism. We have been conducting a study using most or multi-phased optimization strategy framework to learn how we can optimize support – optimize family navigation to support engagement in behavioral health service. The findings that we will be presenting today has expanded our work further to exploring how we can adapt family navigation and the work of promotoras to support LGBTQ youth and their families. When we talk about family navigators and promotoras, in some ways, they are quite similar but there are some differences. In terms of the family navigation, it relies on community health workers who are referred to as navigators, who are trained in some behavior change and patient engagement of family engagement strategies, including motivational interviewing, collaborative problem solving, and psychoeducation in order to accomplish family goals and navigate barriers to care and also to provide cross-sector care coordination. They are generally paid employees who are part of health systems and embedded in primary care or specialty clinics. And they also are provided as part of their position with clinical supervision and case review. Promotoras are specifically members of the Latinx community. They are Spanish speaking and usually serve on a volunteer basis. They are really truly community members and support linkage to a wide range of health and social services. In terms of navigator role and training, I would like to spend some time talking about that because there is no formal educational pathway for community health workers. Training is often not well documented and can be quite variable. The next slide includes video clips from the navigators of our current behavioral health project and highlights some of the key aspects of their role and training. I thought this information might be helpful as you consider the role of community health workers in your work. I would like to introduce our navigators, Maria Ortiz and Deanne True. They are also, as I mentioned, refer to family partners and in the study that is taking place at a federally qualified health center called Dorchester House in the Boston area. They will be talking about their role and particular the role they play in cross-sector care coordination. (Video) EMILY FEINBERG: Family engagement is perhaps one of the most important components of the navigator role. In this next clip, Deanne talks about learning MI and how that has affected her practice as a navigator and her approach to family engagement. Motivational interviewing is part of the larger training curriculum. It was adapted from one used to train integrated behavioral health clinicians and relies on a common factors approach. Her comments really highlight the way that evidence-based practices can be utilized by community health workers when working with families. (Video) EMILY FEINBERG: Another component of navigator training is understanding systems of care. Working in a primary care setting is often a new experience for navigators even individuals who had extensive community experience. It is also a new experience for behavioral health and primary care clinicians to work closely with a community health worker as an equal team member. It requires dedicated attention to promote respectful and trusting relationships. In this clip, Deanne is comparing her role as a navigator in primary care to that of care coordinators or community-based community health workers and comments on the values that she sees of being embedded in a primary care team. (Video) EMILY FEINBERG: The final part of navigator role in training that I wanted to highlight is the role the navigator plays in helping a family to understand a child’s behavioral health, diagnosis, or concern and their plan of care. They have the ability to discuss a behavioral health condition from a shared cultural perspective that often clinicians do not have. But in order for them to feel comfortable to have these conversations, it is important to provide opportunities for community health workers to learn the skills they need to engage comfortably in these discussions with families. In our projects, we have utilized an online training platform as well as in-person training, developed by a larger pediatric behavioral health initiative, TEAM UP for Children. This is an initiative that is taking place at this health center site as well as seven other health centers in the Boston area. It provides foundational training in behavioral health conditions such as anxiety, depression, ADHD, as well as more general issues that a navigator or promotora might confront when they might experience when they are discussing with families such as parental stress and trauma. This foundational learning is supplemented by role-focused learning specifically designated for community health workers. It also includes specific training around crisis management, suicidality and safety. I hope that this has given you enough idea of what the navigation role looks like in practice, how training might occur and really set a stage for thinking about how this role might be adapted for the LGBTQ children and youth and their families. I am going to turn it over to Dr. Broder-Fingert who will introduce the next section of the webinar. SARABETH BRODER-FINGERT: Thank you, Emily. That was a wonderful background. I am going to talk now a little bit about the research project that we undertook and some of the findings along with Dr. Barnett. I think what we have discussed so far is we have really given an overview of some of the mental health needs of LGBTQ youth and particularly that there are significant needs greater than many other populations. And Dr. Israel gave a nice overview of that. And Dr. Feinberg gave us a nice overview of two specific models of community health work or lay health workers that we are looking at in this particular study although we certainly know there are many other models. But what we want to highlight and what we thought about in this project is the fact that CHWs or community health workers really hold a lot of promise to improve access to mental health services. But at the same time, we know that traditionally CHWs have focused on overcoming disparities or inequities among racial and ethnic minority groups. But as Dr. Israel highlighted in the beginning of the talk, LGBTQ youth particularly those from intersectional identities have additional needs that have not yet been addressed within the CHW workforce. These youth and their families often have both unique cultural strengths and also challenges related to their intersectional identity and our CHWs, a potential workforce that can help overcome some of these challenges and improve access to mental health services. We, as in the implementation science team, really wanted to take an implementation science lens and thinking about how can CHWs be adapted to address the mental health needs of LGBTQ youth and we really wanted to think about from this implementation science lens the fact that we know adaptation happens and is critical to the success of interventions, but how can we be thoughtful and deliberate about adapting this intervention for the specific population? This is a paper that I am just going to tease right now because it is not out yet, but it is coming out soon. And a lot of what we are going to discuss today is in this paper as well. If you want to hear more on our thoughts about adapting this workforce, keep an eye out for this paper that will be coming out soon. As I mentioned, what we wanted to do in this project is take advantage of these two CHW workforces, one that is out of Boston, Massachusetts and that is a family navigator workforce and then a second out of Santa Barbara, California that is a promotora workforce to understand what the needs are for CHWs to better serve the LGBTQ community and then also what the LGBTQ community tells us about what their needs are. We really wanted to look at the needs of both parents and youth, the training needs for CHWs, and then how can we use that information to preemptively adapt the innovation to allow for better services for this community. As I mentioned, what I think are the strengths of our study is that we actually took the view of two different populations in two different parts of the country. For the professional participants or the lay health worker participants, we interviewed four navigators, four family navigators in Boston and seven promotoras in Santa Barbara. And Boston and Santa Barbara are different in a number of ways. First of all, geographically, they are different. Boston is – the site that we were working from is much more urban. Santa Barbara, although there are urban areas, they are also a large area that is rural as well. And then in Boston, the family navigators or family partners are directly employed by the health center. In Santa Barbara, the promotoras are actually a volunteer workforce of specifically Latina women. While they are both considered community health workers, there are actually some important differences that we thought we could use to better explore the needs of the navigators and promotoras in their training, but also in the needs of the community that they serve. And then the last thing that I want to mention is both Boston and Santa Barbara are both relatively affluent communities. We want to take that into consideration as we are thinking about the meanings of these findings. I just talked about the study subject participants who were the lay health workers. But we also interviewed youth and parents. I know someone asked in the comments, what age group did we consider youth. We were considering these are emerging adults so older youth. We wanted to show their identities in this way because this is going to be a consistent theme as we discuss the findings, which is that we really want to allow people to use their own voice to identify themselves. We did not want to categorize them for you, and we did not want to display this as a bar chart or a graph to categorize people into individual identities. We wanted to allow our participants to identify themselves. This becomes really important as we think about the findings because as someone who works in this space, one of the most common questions I get is what should the identity be of the community health worker that we want to hire when I meet with health systems who are interested in this kind of work. I think the challenge particularly with thinking about this study is that a lot of people have intersectional identities. And if you were trying to serve an LGBTQ and Latinx community, should your family navigator or community health worker identify from one or both of those communities and why does it matter. That is a little bit of what we are going to get into as we move forward. Now, I am going to pass this over to Dr. Miya Barnett, who is going to talk a little bit more about our research methods. MIYA BARNETT: Thank you so much, Dr. Broder-Fingert. We conducted semi-structured interviews with the three participant groups. I do want to reflect on the point of our youth being over the age of 18. We thought it was important to be able to hear the perspectives of youth who were able to consent for themselves to participate in the research. Many people were reflecting back on their experiences of being younger and having less autonomy than they currently do. But we conducted semi-structured interviews with the youth, with the community health workers, and with the caregivers who were all in this study biological parents. And we made our semi-structure interview guides specific to each group, but also covering similar areas around what resources were needed, what cultural considerations there were with the coming out process and what their personal experience in their own role was and then what training needs an individual who was helping families of LGBTQ youth would have. We really sought to reflect a range of gender and sexual orientation in the caregivers of the youth and the youth themselves. We used a Rapid Qualitative Analysis approach that has been used extensively and more recently within implementation science that Dr. Allison Hamilton has really pioneered and put forth as a way to address how implementation science often is happening quickly to address in the moment needs of a community. And I think that all of us on this call can agree that the mental health needs of all members of the world right now are quite extensive, but specifically looking at the statistics from the Trevor Project that Dr. Israel presented that we have urgent needs within the LGBTQ population, the youth population especially for our youth of color. We wanted to do a rapid technique where you use interview templates and summarize interviews and then are able to put those summaries within a coding matrix to see if there are differences across stakeholder groups. We thought this was especially valuable having three different stakeholder groups in two different settings to see where the similarities in differences and themes were. I am going to go over those results now. Across all participants, community health workers, parents, and youth in Boston and Santa Barbara County, the role of stigma and discrimination that we have heard about from Dr. Israel really came through. And what was spoken about quite extensively was the role that culture and how the cultural groups of the participants could exacerbate the feelings of stigma and discrimination. Not unexpected, but a common theme was not just about culture, but really the role that religion within the culture can have that makes that really can intensify feelings of stigma and discrimination felt by the youth themselves and then enacted through their parents, but also for the parents. A quote from one of our youths is there is so much machismo in the community that does not allow me to be my full self. This goes back to the idea that gender normative societies could have higher rates of stigma and discrimination. A parent talked about how they themselves really want to support their youth. Their concern was within what their youth was going to experience. It was like what is going to happen to them now. Are they going to be okay? Are they going to be safe? Stress for the parents about what their youth are going to face, what their children are going to face. And a community health worker said there is a lot of misinformation, the culture, the beliefs, even feeling negatively about the families. Again, pointing to the fact that often these parents are feeling stigma and discrimination and that they are blaming themselves for having a sexual or gender minority youth. Again, it was actually very consistent across groups and across sites that more culturally and linguistically appropriate resources were needed both for youth and for parents. And the way that these resources were described really range from light touch, easy to disseminate materials like pamphlets that could be available within a doctor’s office that explained things like what are these terms, what is sexual orientation, what is a gender identity. That was a point of confusion that many youths describe having concerns that they wish that their parents could know without them having to educate. That the pamphlets needed to be provided in a range of language for our population. For our study population, it was predominantly Spanish that was spoken about. That there was a need for support groups, which as Dr. Israel mentioned, there is a history of peer support for families of LGTBQ youth with PFLAG, but often not within the cultural groups that the families themselves are coming from our sample. And that there needs to be more mental health services. Just a complete lack of mental health services was something that was recognized, but very specifically that the youth and the parents and the community health workers were talking about the need that these mental health services be affirming for LGTBQ youth and responsive to their specific needs. I will get into that a little bit more with – findings. It was clear that from the community health workers and the parents specifically that there was feelings of confusion and a lack of awareness of different terms related to gender and sexual orientation and that this confusion could cause some feelings of shame and really drive avoidance – talking about sexual orientation and gender identity with youth. Similarly, youth identified a desire for their parents to know more about their identities and use correct language to feel more supported. We heard from Dr. Israel how using correct pronouns that can be something that buffers against suicidal risk. I am going to get into why this might be especially relevant for us to think about when we are adapting for different linguistic groups. A parent said and I so found myself wishing that they were just gay instead of non-binary. Is that their gender? At first, I thought they were gender fluids. That is what I thought. And now they are saying their gender is non-binary. I am trying to understand the differences. Even amongst a population of caregivers and parents that were willing to do interviews with us, which probably biases the sample. It is really people who potentially feel more open to supporting their youth. There was just this confusion and not understanding what their youth were even talking about with their gender identity, which made it harder for them to support. And then a non-binary youth said, it is still hard for her, speaking about her mom, to integrate that and she was speaking about the pronoun elle in her daily language. When she talks to me, she still uses the masculine form, the masculine pronoun. This is really interesting and important and specific to the Spanish language. And I can’t speak to other languages, but I think it really points to something we all would need to be mindful about with interventions and how to help community health workers and then also help parents is how languages treat gender. This was a youth that had transitioned and first identified as trans masculine and then identified as non-binary. And the mom had made the transition to using male pronounces, but the pronoun elle is a gender-neutral term in Spanish instead of saying elle or elle. It is a new word in Spanish. Spanish is very gender in the way that you conjugate adjectives and all sorts of things. This was a further stretch for this mom to understand it. When you think about how using correct pronouns might impact a youth’s mental health within the home and how this might be additionally challenging for Spanish-speaking families or families from other languages that are more gendered languages. I think it is really important for us to think about how to support families even with those most basic logistical shifts. It was very striking in our interviews and also speaking with our advisory group, which works with youth in medical settings that there are specific challenges for trans youth. And that parents and youth specifically recognize these additional challenges related to discrimination and a lack of understanding and challenges navigating systems and the resources needed. I just spoke about language. Another quote that shows how this came up with multiple participants – youth saying when I speak in Spanish, I do not know how to gender myself so even for the youth themselves, struggling with the language component. There was more discrimination faced and described for trans youth coming from family members, again, family members towards the youth and also family members towards the parents of the youth. The schools discriminating against these youth like which bathroom their children were able to use and also even from medical providers and mental health providers. The spaces that were meant to be safe and the systems that are meant to be safe really not being safe spaces for trans youth. More systems to navigate and more places in which parents need to advocate. And also, that there are more resources needed by trans youth – but also legal services to do name changes and hormones and surgery and so just quite a bit of additional stress and burden that caregivers and youth were described – of trans youth were describing. How might this translate for community health workers? We asked all participants what would a role of a navigator or a community health worker be? And really our participants were identifying strong fits behind these navigation bridge services and what is needed. Navigating health and mental health services specifically like I said for trans youth, recognizing that there is multiple different types of mental health and health needs. The community health workers who share identities with parents who are coming from the same cultural group as the parents and speaking the same language could really be a source of social support when parents are feeling isolated and stigmatized and education, that they could be helping parents understand questions and doing some of that processing that Dr. Israel was talking about that can be necessary but is not helpful when the parents are burdening the youth with that. That the community health workers’ understanding of the different needs of the families and what comes up in the culture really can help make the care that is being received more culturally responsive. And the model of community health workers, promotoras, and navigators, which focuses so much on advocacy across systems, is especially well fit for LGBTQ populations. At the same time, community health workers, which included the navigators and the promotoras, so it did not really seem to matter whether you were invited within primary care or more embedded within the community expressed a strong desire to support LGBTQ youth and their parents. They really said I see this as part of my role. I can see how important this is and we see how there is additional needs. But they mostly had not had experience of doing this and did not have training on how to work with LGBTQ youth or parents. We had a range of what experiences people had. We had one community health worker who very openly said I used to feel a lot of prejudice towards LGBTQ individuals. I was very uncomfortable with it. And then I have educated myself. And through that education, I realized what the needs are and why it is important to be accepting to individuals who maybe had family members who were LGTBQ, but really within their own roles had not worked with families that much. They described many training needs – they wanted to support. They just did not know how. This project really identified some concrete areas for adaptation of community health worker models. The first thing that became clear is that we really want to think about who we mean when we are talking about having a navigator or a community health worker model. What became clear is that it is important for all the community health workers to have training around how to work with families, but that parents are going to have different needs than their youth. For a parent, it might be valuable to actually have a community health worker who is more similar to them in terms of the culture they come from. The youth may benefit from having somebody who is also a peer and part of the LGBTQ community, but that individual – those might be different individuals who are working with the family and helping navigate this relationship. There needs to be in training for community health workers at a content related to different terms. What is sexual orientation? What do we mean when we say non-binary? Why is it different? Why are gender and sexual orientation different? For many people in this call, these might seem basic issues. But it is a place that there were lots of questions for adults who are supporting youth, including the community health workers. We want that to be part of the training. What types of family dynamics come up and how do you navigate those family dynamics when you are working with a family of LGTBQ youth? And what resources are available within the community? It really was important to make sure that you are addressing the intersection of the cultural norms when working with parents and youth and that those might look different with how you are addressing those needs. This means that the navigation model itself might then extend to have more education for parents around the role of parental support and terms, how to connect to mental health services, and how to advocate and navigate across systems of care specifically for trans youth. I am going to pass it back to Dr. Broder-Fingert. SARABETH BRODER-FINGERT: Thank you, Dr. Barnett. That was a wonderful overview of our findings. I am tasked with the heavy job of summarizing our findings. I actually think we can do it pretty quickly because traditionally CHWs have been thought of as a bridge, a bridge to services for families who have traditionally had challenges getting services. And in this study, we were particularly looking at CHWs, whose role it is – bridge youth to mental health services and community resources. But I think what has been a really interesting finding from this study is that youth are really eager for a bridge to help them navigate the relationship with their parents, LGBTQ particularly because I think that is a unique aspect of this potential role for LGBTQ youths and certainly something that CHWs could do with appropriate training that could be incredibly valuable for these families. If we continue to think about CHWs as a bridge, we can think about the traditional bridge. We can think about this additional bridge of the youth to parent relationship and how can we support that. And then we also have the parent and their needs. Parents and traditional family navigator or CHW relationships. The parents are part of the family unit and the CHW is supporting the family unit and getting mental health services for the youth. But in these interviews, we found that parents are actually eager for their own support in understanding and supporting their child whether it be understanding the terms that are used, the child’s identity, or the stress that the parents report to us and the potential need for their own mental health services around how to cope with their child’s identity. There is another bridge that I think needs to be added to this model if we are going to formally support LGBTQ youth. Again, we have the standard bridge to mental health and community resources. We add on the bridge between the youth and the parent and then yet another bridge for the parent for their own mental health and their own community resources. Again, what are the final implications? We think that family navigation is a really important model that could really help families overcome the cultural and logistical barriers in accessing mental health. But we do think that what our study shows is that adaptations are certainly needed to improve access to services and allow this model to be effective in this population. And particularly CHWs report a desire for more training and supervision about topics related to LGBTQ youth. Future directions. We are now working on hopefully developing CHW training specific to LGBTQ youth. We are also working to develop resources that the CHWs and the families suggested that were needed for the community. And then some other considerations. As we mentioned, the youth and the parents did report some different needs and particularly around their identities. And we are thinking about whether or not a peer mentoring model might be more effective specifically for the youth. We are also thinking about parent training and support groups because of that need for the parents to have some sort of bridge to their own mental health community resources. We also want to highlight the finding that we heard many times that this model could be particularly valuable for trans youth who experience even more barriers than other populations. Finally, we want to thank NIMH for our funding, of course, our wonderful advisory boards, our research team and finally without our participants who were amazing to participate in this study, none of this would be possible of course. Now, we are going to turn it back over to Dr. Tamara Lewis Johnson, who is going to start helping field some questions. TAMARA LEWIS-JOHNSON: Great. It Looks like there are a lot of really interesting questions. I am just going to take them right as they are presented here. Thank you to all the viewers who shared questions. The first question is could you really expand on what age group of youth were being served. I think you talked about that a little bit, but there may be some variation between the age group of the youth that were served in Santa Barbara versus those who were served in the Boston area. MIYA BARNETT: I wanted to just – I saw that question and I think it came up when Dr. Israel was talking about youth. I do think that is important to talk about. Just to clarify, the youth we interviewed were emerging adults. They were already 18 or older. But Dr. Israel, did you want to talk about what age of youth you were talking about with the types of outcomes you were referring to. TANIA ISRAEL: Sure. Thanks so much for that question. The Trevor Project survey from this year that I was sharing some of the results from, they were looking at youth aged 13 to 24. It was a fairly broad range of teenagers up into emerging adults. TAMARA LEWIS-JOHNSON: Thank you. Another person asked – another viewer asked – I am just going to read this. I have heard that some cultures are more accepting of gender minorities than sexual minorities. I am wondering if this is the case for the Native American population. I would have initially thought the suicide attempt rate would be lower because of some cultures accepting those who are two spirit, but that group still had the highest suicide attempt rates. I think, Dr. Israel, that question is directed to you. TANIA ISRAEL: Sure. Thanks for that. There are cultural differences in terms of acceptance and historical acceptance of transgender and gender non-binary folks and certainly within some Native American cultures that is true. I hear the person asking the question saying, how is that not protective. The other thing to keep in mind is that the more types of discrimination that youth are experiencing, the higher the rates of suicidality and certainly Native American youth are experiencing a good deal of that so not just based on gender identity and sexual orientation but certainly based on being Native American. And, in fact, Native American people have a particularly elevated suicide rate compared to other ethnic groups. I think that probably helps to explain more of it than the acceptance within the community and culture. TAMARA LEWIS-JOHNSON: Here is another question. How have community health workers, navigators, and promotoras’ efforts shifted during COVID to accommodate community access during this time? MIYA BARNETT: I am happy to take this question. Community health workers have really been at the frontline during COVID-19. We all spoke pretty extensively of the role of community health workers within mental health. But they play many roles with social services and physical health in whether there are volunteers in community embedded or within health systems. Community health workers and their services were impacted during COVID-19 just like any other health care system. There were shifts to telehealth, but also, they have been seen as frontline responders across the world to COVID-19. The roles that community health workers have and their ability to build trusting relationships within their communities have been crucial in doing vaccine advocacy, contact tracing, testing, education. It is just really important to recognize, again, taking an intersectional approach, but these individuals were often being doubly impacted by the pandemic. They were part of the frontline worker group who had their own stress and mental health impacted so much by the challenges of the pandemic and our members of the communities who have been especially hard hit because of COVID. So it is recognized that community health workers have had a huge role in the COVID-19 response. In fact, the American Rescue Plan dedicated $330 million toward supporting community health workers. But it is a group that has also had a lot of vulnerabilities and stressors put into place, including the shift to telehealth, having challenges based on all the challenges that you might imagine like whether there is access to the Internet and – devices. I think we all in our projects had some different experiences working with community health workers and what that shift looked like. But I really do want to commend the role that they have played in COVID-19 and respond to how they have not just been addressing the things we talked about, but also really at the front of the pandemic response. EMILY FEINBERG: I just wanted to second what Dr. Barnett said. We are sitting on different sides of the country, but really experienced very similar things. The biggest shift that we saw initially was from toward meeting just basic needs. Food insecurity was huge. Families were confined to homes. We had newer situations that community health workers were dealing with where families had no food in the home because they could not leave. They were the ones who were really dealing with this and finding the community resources to get food into people’s houses. It was really on the ground concrete work. The other thing that as sort of things have stabilized a bit is the challenges that they have had in doing some of the traditional cross-sector collaboration work that they had done before, particularly work with schools, early intervention agencies, and other community mental health agencies, which had essentially shut down. They were maybe providing services remotely but finding a contact person and how to reach someone had been incredibly challenging. I think it has added the stress that they have had both in their work in the incredibly high needs of the families they are working with. Also, their work has really taken – it is just much slower and much more intense and takes longer to accomplish the same goals. But the work that they are doing is amazing that they have figured out ways to connect with families. They have mentored families through how to connect remotely, which many families really needed one-on-one tutorials to do and they played an amazing role. TAMARA LEWIS-JOHNSON: Here is another question. Can you speak to both the workflow of how the community health worker is utilized by the practice as well as the funding? For example, can you bill for community health worker services or is this grant funded or something else? MIYA BARNETT: I am going to jump on the funding and then Dr. Feinberg, if you could take – or Dr. Broder-Fingert, if you could take the workflow of the navigation model. But I just had to jump on funding because this is a big soapbox that I like to get on. Community health workers. One of the greatest challenges to implementation and sustainment of community worker models within primary care or other community settings are challenges with billing. A lot of work within this field has been done with research grants or philanthropic grants. Because of challenges with billing and not having codes that could be billed directly to community health workers and this is something we hear all the time is a challenge, a number of states have already passed bills that allow community health workers to bill within medical settings. And other states are considering them, especially in the context of COVID and how important it could be. But if this is something that feels really interesting to you and relevant to you, I think it is a valuable thing to look into what is happening at the local level and also advocate for change that the community health worker services be billable because it is hard to implement and sustain without that financial support both for the systems and also to have equity for the community health workers, getting paid for their very important labor that they are doing. I will say that and pass it to somebody else to talk about what that workflow looks like within a clinic. SARABETH BRODER-FINGERT: I will let Dr. Feinberg talk more about. I just want to give a little plug again for our paper because we talk about this as well as some of the challenges around billing and sustainability. If you are interested, I would definitely keep an eye for that. But I will let Dr. Feinberg talk about the workflow specifically within the clinic. EMILY FEINBERG: I will talk about our experiences as well as the experience at the safety net hospital that we are affiliated with. Generally, the navigators are on sight and they are on the floor during sessions. Sometimes a family is identified as someone that navigators should be with prior to their visit based on what we know about the family and their needs. Our health center does screening both for behavioral needs as well as for material needs. We identify a variety of needs through that process. And when a need is identified, there is a navigator there to meet with the family and just – they are introduced as part of the team and as someone who might be able to help them with the need that they have identified. As I said, that could be a material need or it could be a mental health need. It could be a need for maternal or parental mental health services that is included within the scope of our workflow. If there is not someone on site then we have a referral network, essentially an electronic record. We have a portal the referral goes. There is telephone contact made. I am not sure if that answers your question, but that is kind of how it works. And then the community health worker or family partner or navigator takes it from there. TAMARA LEWIS-JOHNSON: Thank you, Dr. Feinberg and Dr. Barnett. This is another question. How do you work with a family that has totally disowned their child? SARABETH BRODER-FINGERT: Actually, Dr. Barnett, are you willing to start on that one because I think this is one space where the difference between the models might come into play a little bit because it is different when a health center is working with the child who has been disowned by the family versus a community organization. I do not know if you want to say something about the promotoras’ ability to work with different family members as the family desires or as the individual desires versus the health center’s need to work with a family unit in a little bit of a different way. MIYA BARNETT: I was going to pass to Dr. Israel and ask about her other work. I think that what this really comes up is the idea of adaptation and treatment goals being important and who is the best fit for family navigation and what is the goal. I do think that – unfortunately, we know that families disowning their LGBTQ youth is common and that it is a cause of homelessness. It is a cause of very great use of the foster care system and that the rates of these really tragic outcomes can be quite high within this population. That is a youth that is going to need a lot of services wrapped around them and have a lot of support. Unfortunately, that might not be working with the parent if there is just no room for change there. I am not going to say that there is never room for change. I think the first thing that we would want to think about is really who are we targeting if it is a youth who is completely estranged from their parent and still needs services. That could still be a navigator role. And in fact, that could be a really important place for a navigator to come into play because there might be even more systems involved for this youth. But that role is maybe going to look different and potentially even be a different individual, a different type of individual than a navigator who is really doing family navigation where the role is about working with the parent as a kind of intervene early before this type of outcome happens and provide them with education and support to help them help their child. I think that for me is where I was thinking about differences in models. Does anyone else want to say more about that? TANIA ISRAEL: I want to say yes, absolutely, all of that. I think that was a great answer. The other thing that I would add is that in the same way that parents can play a supportive role in an unsupportive role, there are lots of other entities that can do either one of those two. Sometimes we think about religion and church being a very restrictive or exclusionary place for LGBTQ youth. But it also may be the place that parents are going to turn. It can also be a place that we can look to in terms of how can this be an affirming environment. How can both lay people and the church leadership and helping people in those roles support families and help them to understand more about what is going on with their children and to be more supportive? Extended families are also something that is very much a cultural value if there are extended family members who can help to support the child directly and/or work more directly with the parents to try to help them to be more supportive. I think we need to think about all of the different places where there might be supports. I think that Dr. Barnett’s point about that child is going to need a lot of support and you do not necessarily want to go only through indirect roots that you have to make sure that that child is getting the support that they need. TAMARA LEWIS-JOHNSON: Thank you, Dr. Israel. Where do we find additional training to support sexual and gender minority youth and their families? What is recommended? I am going to add another one. Are there any insights into building some of the supports mentioned into the BIPOC community? TANIA ISRAEL: I would like to respond to that question especially about training to support SGM youth and their parents. I had mentioned – I know that there is a particular need for parents of trans and non-binary youth. I had mentioned before that Dr. Em Matsuno has a parent support program that is available online. I want to put that – should I put that in the chat or – TAMARA LEWIS-JOHNSON: Yes, put that in the chat. TANIA ISRAEL: I just put it in the chat for everyone. There are two different links that I am providing because I think that that is a great way. It is accessible in terms of being free and being online. I would recommend that as one place to start. SARABETH BRODER-FINGERT: I will just add, Dr. Israel, that there is a huge need. If there is anyone on this call who is interested in this area, I think actually someone in the chat said they are interested in doing work in this area. There is a huge need for more parenting supports and interventions. If this is an area that you might be interested in, I would strongly encourage you to pursue it because I would agree that Em’s intervention is phenomenal. But we need many more interventions out there for all different people, all different communities and just the capacity to support the number of parents that need the support is not there right now. MIYA BARNETT: Yeah, what I will say is as far as training for community health workers and family navigators – what we heard is that it is not happening at least within the communities that we did our interviews with. We also want to recognize that that is a limited group. As far as we know, we do not currently know of these trainings specifically for community health workers and family navigators. That does not mean that are not out there and it is always better to work from things that out there and have been shown to have an evidence base. But this is what happens sometimes with training models is sometimes the community has built something and sometimes there really is a need. Right now, what we are seeing is that need, and we are working on adapting those training modules. But we do not have them to share yet. TANIA ISRAEL: I think the question about building these things into BIPOC communities – I really appreciate that question. I think that is exactly what these kinds of programs are and intended to do. There are people from the community who have the training and can help people navigate these systems. I think that that question is exactly in line with what the intention is of community health workers. TAMARA LEWIS-JOHNSON: What are some of the examples of the specific mental health services that navigators or community health workers might connect LGBTQ youth to? Are those services already adaptive to meet their specific needs? MIYA BARNETT: This is such a good question, and it is going to be so context specific. The ability to connect people to mental health services that already are gender and sexual orientation affirming is limited in many settings. I think this comes into larger systemic issues and potential larger solutions related to online interventions and telehealth and what not and training our mental health workforce more around these issues. This is really a both/and question. Yes, there are services some places that could be directly responsive and not everywhere. SARABETH BRODER-FINGERT: I would just add two things. First of all, I think we heard in our interviews many times that the community resources do not exist. And this is a problem for a number of things that CHWs are tasked to do. Sometimes we call it the bridge to nowhere that they are supposed to bridge people. But if there is not something at the end of the bridge that could be a challenge. Potentially, this is a role that CHWs could play. If they had the resources, they could know which mental health services are LGBTQ competent or affirming because that is something I hear quite frequently. I need a therapist for my child. Do you know one that is LGBTQ friendly? Wouldn’t it be great if the CHWs had the resources to be able to help families bridge to those specific LGBTQ-friendly therapists? I think the other thing that I love about this question is, as Dr. Barnett was mentioning, some of the training for CHWs really needs to be context specific. The community resources. That is a huge part of what CHWs link to. And the resources in Boston are different than the resources in Santa Barbara. You cannot really have one training module that you could really launch nationally for all CHWs because they really need to understand the community resources to effectively do their job. As we were thinking about training, which was a big issue that came up in a number of our interviews, you not only want to think about an LGBTQ 101, what do these terms mean, how do you be culturally competent among LGBTQ youth and their families? But you also need a what do we need to know to do this successfully in Santa Barbara. What are the local resources that we can connect to? Putting on my implementation science hat, how do you implement and disseminate a training that is so context specific I think is going to be another aspect of the future work that we want to do in this space? MIYA BARNETT: I am just going to say one more thing, which is a community health worker model that we really did not talk about in this presentation but has been used widely and globally is doing more of a task shifting, task sharing approach where it is the community health workers who are providing prevention or intervention. In that realm of the bridge to nowhere, this is something that I like to talk about a lot is that the community needs to think about what the context is and do they have services to link to. If they don’t, is the role of the community health worker better served to be the bridge or is it to be the provider? The reason that community health workers are most frequently tasked as providers in a low and middle-income countries is because there is a high recognition that there are not providers who could provide those services. It is best to be done by a community health worker. In the United States, we have more mental health providers, but we do not always have specialized mental health providers. And actually, there is many populations because of the language that is spoken or where they live in the country that do not have enough mental health providers. Thinking about how we could learn from models that have been used in low and middle-income countries and implement them to address disparities here, making sure that the training and supervision and financial support and all of those things are there and are the types of solutions that we need to be thinking about. TAMARA LEWIS-JOHNSON: Thank you so much, Dr. Barnett. I just have gotten the cue. We have one last question. I will move forward with that. Are there specific resources for working with black trans youth and families that you would recommend? TANIA ISRAEL: I just want all of the researchers on the call to hear that question because I think we all need to really be engaged in trying – I think that the call for these resources is so clear. The need for these resources is so clear and we need lots more. Unfortunately, there is not a specific thing that I have that I suggest. But we are working on trying to figure out what is most needed in specific communities because I think what is too often done is that we look at a broad intervention and then we say how can we adapt it for these other communities. I think that really this kind of project starting with minoritized communities and looking at the needs and how we can meet them is a really valuable way to go. I just call on all of our colleagues to join us in these efforts to develop community-specific interventions to support. TAMARA LEWIS-JOHNSON: Thank you. I want to thank all the panelists for participating. I am just now going to – if we could go to the last slide. I want to thank all the viewers who hung in there with us for the hour and a half that we have. This is an emerging area and an important area of research that requires further attention. If you have programmatic questions, you know how to reach me. If you have general information and status about the webinar recordings, you can contact us at this web address. I wanted to also say that this will be – there will be a transcript that will be developed for this webinar. It will be archived on our ODWD or Office of Disparities Research and Workforce Diversity website. It will be available within a month or so. I just want to thank everyone, all the panelists, all the staff for participating and enjoy the rest of your afternoon. (The webinar adjourned at 3:30 p.m.)

> Advancing Evidence-Based Interventions to Improve Access to Mental Health Services for LGBTQ+ Youth Date Location Overview Significant mental health disparities exist for sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth as a result of frequent discrimination and a lack of support from family members and society. To improve mental health outcomes, it is important to understand how LGBTQ+ youth of color and their families negotiate intersecting identities, manage stigma and discrimination, and develop or utilize social support systems. This webinar provided an overview of an NIMH-sponsored study that adapts an evidence-based mental health intervention for LGBTQ+ youth of color and their families. It also showcased potential mechanisms that can be used to adapt the intervention to address mental health disparities faced by SGM youth of color.

> Day One: Workshop: Promoting Mental Health for Sexual and Gender Minority Youth: Evidence-Based Developmental Perspectives Transcript EVENT PRODUCER: Okay. Let's get started. Welcome, everybody, and thank you for joining us today for Promoting Mental Health for Sexuality and Gender Minority Youth: Evidence‑Based Development Perspectives. Just a few housekeeping notes and reminders. Participants, again, have entered listen‐only mode, cameras off, and mics are muted. Please submit your questions via the Q&A box at any time during the webinar. Questions will be answered during the discussion session of the workshop. If you have any technical difficulties hearing or viewing the webinar, please note these in the Q&A box and our technicians will work to fix the problem. You can also send an email to NIMH Events. That's nimh@mn‑e.com. And with that, I will now pass it over to Dr. Stacia Friedman-Hill. STACIA FRIEDMAN-HILL: Thank you. Good morning. I am Stacia Friedman-Hill. My pronouns are she/they. And I am a program director at the National Institute of Mental Health. On behalf of the planning committee, I'm pleased to welcome you to our workshop, Promoting Mental Health for Sexual and Gender Minority Youth: Evidence‑Based Developmental Perspectives. This workshop represents the collective efforts of seven NIH institutes, centers, and offices, and I think this underscores the broad impact and importance of this topic. And I want to share that the most common response we heard when we reached out to invite speakers and discussants was "this workshop is so needed" followed by "how else can I help you." Before we get started on the fantastic program we've put together, we have several welcoming remarks to share with you. It is my great honor to be able to introduce a message from the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Health and the head of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, Admiral Rachel L. Levine. Before serving as a state and federal official, Dr. Levine's training and academic appointments were concentrated in pediatrics and adolescent medicine. And now, let's hear from Admiral Levine. We're having some technical difficulties. Can we pause the video and get the audio to start? We're seeing Admiral Levine but can’t hear her words. If you can restart from the beginning, that would be great. I'm sorry. We still can't hear the audio as the panelists or the audience. EVENT PRODUCER: My apologies. My mic was muted. So sorry about that. I will restart the video. RACHEL LEVINE: Thank you so much for inviting me to join you today. I'm sorry I cannot be there in‑person, but I am honored to be a part of this event. I am Admiral Rachel Levine, and I am proud to serve as the Assistant Secretary for Health at the United States Department of Health and Human Services. I'm also proud that I am the first transgender Senate‑confirmed federal official and the first transgender four‑star admiral in the United States Public Health Service Commission Corps. Adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs, can change the way children's brains and bodies develop and function. They contribute to increased risk of poor mental health, substance use, suicidal behaviors, chronic diseases, and other poor health and well‑being outcomes into adulthood. Research shows that experiencing discrimination, including discrimination due to identifying or being perceived as LGBTQI+ is itself an adverse childhood event. People who identify as LGBTQI+ are more likely to experience many different types of ACEs, including child abuse, neglect, and other household challenges compared to people who identify as heterosexual and whose gender matches their sex at birth. Young people who identify as LGBTQ+ or who have same‑sex sexual contacts are also more likely to experience other childhood adversities such as bullying, sexual violence, teen dating violence, witnessing violence in their community, unstable housing or homelessness, and food insecurity. New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collected among U.S. teens from six states in 2021 indicate that 26.1% of high school students, more than a quarter of the entire national high school population, have experienced interpersonal discrimination due to their sexual identity. Positive experiences in childhood wire the brain to thrive. It can help to counterbalance the effects of adverse experiences. Preventing ACEs and promoting positive childhood experiences, or PCE, can improve health and well‑being for all children, including those who identify as LGBTQI+. Making sure that PCEs are common and widespread is critical to improving health. No single sector can achieve this alone. We must work together to build a strong overall foundation for childhood well‑being. Examples of PCEs can include having nurturing relationships with parents, friends, or other adults, living in caring and supportive neighborhoods, having feelings of belonging at school or in the community, being able to engage in after‑school activities, including cultural or other traditions. Now, June is Pride Month. This is an especially good time to reach out to LGBTQI+ organizations, leaders, healthcare providers, and even individuals in your own circles to share more information about the particular challenges queer young people face in our country today and how we can help them thrive in the face of those challenges. I believe that we are not doing better unless we are all doing better. That includes our LGBTQI+ youth who we know are facing politically and ideologically motivated attacks in communities around the country. We must do better. We can do better. And with your help, we will do better. Thank you, and have a great session today, and happy Pride. STACIA FRIEDMAN-HILL: Wow. I am so grateful to Dr. Levine for taking time out of her packed schedule to prepare such an inspiring introduction for us. We will also hear from the Deputy Director of the National Institute of Mental Health, Dr. Shelli Avenevoli. Prior to joining NIMH, Dr. Avenevoli received her Ph.D. in developmental psychology from Temple University and completed a post‑doctoral fellowship in psychiatric epidemiology at Yale University School of Medicine. Dr. Avenevoli initially came to NIMH as a staff scientist in the intramural program and eventually moved to extramural research administration, serving as a program officer and branch chief and then deputy director. And I will let Dr. Avenevoli share her own update about her newest duties during her remarks. Over to you, Dr. Avenevoli. SHELLI AVENEVOLI: Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much, Stacia. So, I'm Shelli Avenevoli, my pronouns are she/her, and I'm currently the Deputy Director of NIMH, as Stacia noted. As some of you also may know, our current NIMH director, Dr. Joshua Gordon, will be stepping down this Friday from his position as director. So, in the interim, while NIH conducts a national search for the next permanent director of NIMH, I will serve as the acting NIMH director. It's really my pleasure and my honor to welcome you to our workshop today. The workshop is focused, as you know, on promoting mental health for sexual and gender minority youth. In the last few years, we've seen an increase in incidents of mental illness symptoms reported by children, adolescents and young adults. According to the 2021 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, high school students who are female, identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or questioning or had any same‑sex partners were more likely than their peers to experience poor mental health and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Nearly 60% of female’s students and nearly 70% of students who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or questioning experience persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness. And 10% of female students and more than 20% of students who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or questioning attempted suicide. Furthermore, sexual and gender minority youth often experience disparities in the prevalence of mental illness, access to healthcare, quality of that care, and experiences of trauma and adversity, as well as inequities in social determinants such as education or quality of housing. Youth with more than one marginalized identity such as those who are transgender and live in rural communities or are part of a marginalized racial or ethnic group may experience even greater disparities. Stigma, minority stress, school and social climate, experiences of discrimination, harassment and bullying and lack of access to sexual and gender‑affirming services, they all contribute to these increased reports of symptoms of mental illness, as well as increased risk overall for mental illness. Identifying strategies that can improve mental health care for sexual and gender minority youth is of great importance to NIMH. Staff in the NIMH Office of Disparities Research and Workforce Diversity, as well as other researchers across our institute, work closely with those at other NIH institutes, centers, and offices to support research that can improve our understanding of the complex factors impacting the well‑being and mental health needs of sexual and gender minority individuals and to reduce the mental health disparities experienced by many in this community. In particular, NIMH is supporting research that aims to expand the knowledge base of sexual and gender minority mental health and well‑being, remove barriers to planning, conducting, and reporting NIMH‑sponsored research on sexual and gender minority mental health and well‑being, and strengthen the community of researchers who conduct mental health research relevant to sexual and gender minority populations. NIMH research efforts in this area align with our institute's strategic plan for research, as well as for the NIMH strategic framework for addressing youth mental health disparities. The strategic framework was developed in collaboration with several other NIH institutes, including several of those participating in today's workshops, as well as with multiple other partners across NIH, HHS, and the federal government, and it was informed by researchers and care providers across the country. While critical statistics are concerning and many of the presentations during this workshop will focus on risk, we also aim to celebrate diversity, recognizing the incredible resilience, joy, and creativity that sexual and gender minority youth and their families and allies embody, and seek ways to build supportive environments in which sexual and gender minority youth can thrive. Before we move on to our next speaker, I'd like to thank very much the NIH Sexual and Gender Minority Research Office for co‑sponsoring today's workshop, and I also want to thank the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health for helping plan this workshop with NIMH. So, again, thank you so much for your participation today. I'm looking forward very much to hearing your thoughts and sharing your perspectives and the outcomes of this workshop. Thank you. STACIA FRIEDMAN-HILL: Thank you, Dr. Avenevoli, for your welcoming statement and the support of NIMH for this workshop. It is also my honor to present Dr. Karen Parker, the director of the NIMH Sexual and Gender Minority Research Office, a co‑sponsor of this workshop. Dr. Parker was instrumental in the formation of that office in 2015 in response to an Institute of Medicine report, and she has served as director since 2016. Dr. Parker received her Master of Social Work from the University of Michigan and her Ph.D. from the University of Maryland School of Social Work. Dr. Parker began her career at NIH in 2001 as a Presidential Management Fellow and subsequently served in several roles at the National Cancer Institute before leading the Sexual and Gender Minority Research Office. And now some remarks from Dr. Karen Parker. KAREN PARKER: Welcome and thank you for joining us today for this critical workshop focused on expanding health research and identifying research opportunities for sexual and gender minority health. I'd like to thank NIMH for taking the lead on this critical workshop. As was mentioned, my name is Karen Parker, my pronouns are she and her, and I serve as Director of the Sexual and Gender Minority Research Office here at the National Institutes of Health. I'm so proud that our office is co‑sponsoring today's workshop, and I'm excited for what we will learn together. Our gathering today underscores a glaring truth. There's an undeniable gap in our understanding of the health needs and disparities faced by sexual and gender minority youth. While strides have been made in health research, we cannot ignore that there's limited data on the unique challenges and experiences of this population. To address this pressing issue, we must first address inadequacies in data collection on sexual orientation and gender identity. The current landscape falls short in accurately capturing SOGI data from minors, hindering our ability to develop targeted interventions and policies that cater to the diverse needs of sexual and gender minority youth. Moreover, the limited research available often fails to capture the full spectrum of experiences within these communities, perpetuating misconceptions and overlooking critical health disparities. This workshop serves as a pivotal opportunity for us to challenge the status quo, to push boundaries, and to pave the way for more inclusive and comprehensive health research. It is my hope that today's workshop will identify research opportunities to advance this field of scientific inquiry, amplify the needs of sexual and gender minority youth, and drive meaningful change. Thank you again, and I'm so pleased to be here over the next couple of days. STACIA FRIEDMAN-HILL: Thank you, Dr. Parker, for providing important context in how this workshop fits into the larger ecosphere of NIH research in sexual and gender minority individuals. I'm pleased now to introduce Dr. Monica Webb Hooper, Deputy Director at the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities. Dr. Webb Hooper is an internationally recognized translational behavioral scientist and clinical health psychologist. She's dedicated her career to the scientific study of minority health and racial and ethnic disparities, focusing on chronic illness prevention and health behavior change. Dr. Webb Hooper completed her doctorate in clinical psychology from the University of South Florida and an internship in Medical Psychology at the University of Florida Health Sciences Center. Before joining NIMHD, Dr. Webb Hooper was a professor of oncology, family medicine, and community health and psychological sciences at Case Western Reserve University. Dr. Hooper, we're ready to hear your introductory remarks. MONICA WEBB HOOPER: Thank you so much. Hello everybody, and welcome. I am so pleased to join my colleagues and help open this really important meeting and to help draw attention to critical issues facing our society, the mental health of sexual and gender, or SGM, youth. This is not merely a topic that warrants attention. It demands our empathy and, most importantly, our action. I'm here to underscore the profound commitment of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, or NIMHD, to address the mental health needs of SGM adolescents. In October of 2016, a pivotal moment occurred at NIH when NIMHD, in collaboration with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, officially designated sexual and gender minority groups as a population experiencing health disparities for research purposes. Now, while NIH already had a history of funding meritorious research on the health of sexual and gender minority groups, this designation marked enhanced focus on research initiatives, programs, and activities across NIH aimed at addressing the unique challenges faced by SGM individuals. And it recognized the profound disparities in health and healthcare access experienced by these populations, highlighting the urgent need for research advancements to understand the complexities leading to disparate health outcomes among SGM individuals and strategies to address them. We are delighted at NIMHD to work closely with Dr. Parker's office, and we know that their office is the coordinating hub for SGM health and research‑related activities across NIH. I want to point to two efforts that recently NIMHD has undertaken to help advance this area of science. In March of 2023, NIMHD convened a workshop that complements this meeting focused on the leading causes of death and disability in the SGM population, methodological issues and social and structural drivers of disparities in SGM health. And this workshop is available on the NIH Videocast. It can also be accessed from the NIMHD website. So, I encourage you to check that out. And then, as a next step to the workshop, NIMHD, along with nine participating institutes and offices, released a funding opportunity in December of 2023. It's entitled Addressing Health and Healthcare Disparities Among Sexual and Gender Minority Populations, and it will be active until the fall of 2026. And it aims to support innovative, observational and interventional research to identify and characterize pathways and mechanisms through which health and healthcare disparities occur among SGM populations, specifically of minoritized, racial and ethnic and socioeconomic status backgrounds. Now, we know that there are many needs. And as we seek to address mental health concerns among SGM youth, three things that come to mind for me are interventions, intersectional approaches, and third, pathways to career development. So, first interventions. Much of the existing research is observational rather than interventional, so increased attention to prevention strategies and treatment interventions that include multilevel mechanisms driving mental health disparities are needed. Of course, it's important that interventions also promote culturally and community‑competent as well as gender‑affirming and trauma‑informed healthcare. We also endorse highly community‑led research approaches that help ensure that community needs are prioritized, and further stigmatization is attenuated. Second, intersectionality, which Dr. Avenevoli mentioned. Intersectionality plays a pivotal role in shaping mental health disparities and treatment access. And while there have been initial strides in supporting the mental health of SGM youth through promising approaches such as peer support programs and culturally tailored interventions, significant gaps in research persist, and we see these particularly among SGM youth from racial and ethnic, minoritized, and lower socioeconomic status backgrounds. So, I would also emphasize the need for more nuanced research and interventions that recognize heterogeneity by social status and position. And then third, and finally, workforce development. To accomplish these goals, we must have a well‑trained and diverse biomedical research workforce, including those with lived experience who bring a socio‑ecological approach to these issues. And we know that there are challenges in pathways to career development in standard biomedical research among SGM people that need to be addressed as well. So, I'll just close with this. Addressing the mental health needs of SGM youth is a priority. It's a public health priority. Positive movement requires collaboration and action through multisector commitments. NIMHD is here to support cutting‑edge and meaningful science in this domain, and together we can create a world where all young people, including sexual and gender‑diverse individuals, can thrive mentally, emotionally and physically. Thank you so much. STACIA FRIEDMAN-HILL: Thank you, Dr. Hooper, for your welcome and explaining how this workshop addresses important themes for health equity research. For our final welcoming remarks today, we will hear from Dr. Wilson Compton, the Deputy Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Dr. Compton completed medical school and residency training in psychiatry at Washington University in St. Louis. Before joining NIDA, Dr. Compton was a tenured faculty member in the Department of Psychiatry and director of the Masters in Psychiatric Epidemiology program at Washington University. And before being appointed Deputy Director of NIDA, Dr. Compton served for more than a decade as the director of NIDA's Division of Epidemiology, Services, and Prevention Research. Dr. Compton has been recognized multiple times with the Health and Human Service Secretary's Distinguished Service Award, and he is a Distinguished Life Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association. Dr. Compton, thank you for joining us this morning. WILSON COMPTON: Well, thank you very much, Stacia. And I'm so glad to join my colleagues from across NIH to welcome everyone to this meeting on sexual and gender minority youth and the issues related to development. As I was listening to my colleagues, I'm going, all right, I don't have a lot to add, because I really think the key issues in terms of the developmental risks, the overrepresentation in terms of behavioral health concerns have been highlighted so importantly. What I hope you all will take away from this set of introductions is how much of a priority we at NIH put on being inclusive and comprehensive in our approach to addressing health issues for a population that's frequently been ignored in research and in science. And so certainly on behalf of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, it's my pleasure to help welcome you today. I want to highlight two members of the planning committee, Nick Johnston and Angela Lee‑Winn from NIDA, who have been involved since day one in helping to plan this event, which we're so grateful to our colleagues at NIMH in leading us here today. So why the National Institute on Drug Abuse? You certainly heard a broad inclusion about the issues related to behavioral health, and we're part of that concern. We certainly know that substance use, whether that's tobacco use, cannabis use, or other substances are more frequently seen in sexual and gender minority youth and sexual gender minority adults. So, what explains this? We certainly already heard discussion about the important issues around adverse childhood experiences and how those being more frequent in this population and these persons may help us understand these trajectories. But, of course, it's never going to be that simple. And it's not just one set of factors. So I encourage you all to focus on not just the risk factors and the problems that persons face in this population and others but also focus on the resilience that we see in so many and the positive growth trajectories that we see more and more frequently represented as some of the hope we have for the future to do a better job of reaching those who continue to be at risk and who need science and behavioral health to address their concerns. As we've heard about the issues related to intersectionality from Dr. Webb Hooper, I want to highlight that as well. We're focused on sexual and gender minority youth, and that's the purpose of this meeting. I really hope we'll gain some new insights into how there may be overlapping risks for subpopulations and for those that face multiple issues of trauma and bias and discrimination during development. NIDA is very pleased to be able to support studies that can be used for secondary analysis or ongoing exploration to address some of these issues. I highlight for you in particular the project Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study, which is supported by NIDA, NIMH, and multiple other NIH institutes as a key resource for understanding the development of adolescent brains as well as adolescent social and developmental trajectories as a key resource for you. I'll also point out to you that we think we need to do a better job in terms of standard collection of information about sexual and gender minority status for youth and adults. And so, I'm excited as an epidemiologist to see population studies do a better job in recent years, but we still have a long way to go to enhancing the standard collection of data across all of our research programs so that all those participating today and others in the future can have a better opportunity to address this important research on sexual and gender minority youth development and outcomes. With that, I want to turn it back to Stacia, and I'm so excited to learn from this group about what we can do to have a better and more effective research portfolio going forward. STACIA FRIEDMAN-HILL: Thank you, Dr. Compton, and to all that have provided us with an incredibly warm welcome for this workshop. I am so excited about the presentations we're going to hear for the next two days. And to get us started on our first panel, I'd like to give the floor to my NIH colleague, Dr. Parisa Parsafar. PARISA PARSAFAR: Thank you, Stacia. Can you hear me? STACIA FRIEDMAN-HILL: Yes, we can hear you. PARISA PARSAFAR: Great. Welcome, everyone, to the very first panel session. My name is Parisa Parsafar. I use her/her pronouns. I'm a developmental psychologist and program officer with the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, or NICHD, in the Office of Health Equity. And NICHD is very proud to be partnering with NIMH and our other NIH institutes on this important workshop. The first session today will focus on developmental trajectories of LGBTQ youth, epidemiological trends and measurement of sexual orientation and gender. And the goals of this session are to promote a broader contextual understanding of the mental health related challenges and stressors that LGBTQ youth have faced historically and are still facing today, ways we can better identify, understand, and capture their experiences, and highlight opportunities to help support them as they grow and develop and manage all the biological, cognitive, and social changes that are happening across adolescents and during the transition into young adulthood. We're lucky to have Dr. Kathleen Ethier, Director at the Division of Adolescent and School Health at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, serving as our discussant today. Among the presentations, you'll hear about historical and developmental discussions of mental health stressors experienced by LGBTQ youth by Dr. Ilan Meyer from the UCLA School of Law, challenges, best practices and opportunities regarding measurement of youth sexual and gender identity from Dr. Alexi Potter from the University of Vermont, and, later, Dr. Gregory Phillips from Northwestern University. You'll hear about the latest national research on mental health outcomes and suicide risk among LGBTQ youth from Dr. Derrick Matthews with The Trevor Project, developmental research on the impact of gender‑affirming care from Dr. Johanna Olson‑Kennedy from Children's Hospital Los Angeles, and insights from research on the intersection of autism and gender diversity from Dr. John Strang at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences. The presentations will be followed by commentary from our discussant, a group discussion, and we'll have time for audience questions through the Q&A feature. Dr. Meyer, the floor is yours. Please start us off. ILAN MEYER: Thank you, Parisa. And thank you to NIH and for the participating institutes and centers and for the planning committee for putting together this very humbly titled workshop. I would call it something more like a conference. And I'm very, very pleased to be participating in it but also to see it happening. And, really, my only recommendation is we need this as an annual regular conference. And I'm sure the planning committee is excited to be over this, but maybe it's time to plan the next one. But with that, I would move to my presentation. So, we've been talking about how it's going to get better, and I think at this point is enough time for us to begin to look at has it gotten better. And I'm going to focus on has it gotten better for young people but really for all LGBT people as well. It is important to remember that stigma, homophobia, and transphobia are deeply rooted in our culture. This image is called "The Shameful End of Bishop Atherton and his Proctor John Childe", hanged for sodomy in 1641 in Dublin. Today, 400 years later, almost 400 years later, we're still confronting similar prejudice, even if not hanging. But this is the backdrop for everything we do and everything we're talking about today, I believe. Many of you may be familiar with the minority stress model that is the basis for my thinking about these issues. I think that the important thing that I want to point out for today is that circumstances in the environment, in particular disadvantaged statuses which are intersectional, as everybody ‑‑ as people mentioned already, and I'm particularly concerned with sexual orientation, gender identity and gender in my work, those lead to different types of stressors but including special stressors or added stressors that are related to prejudices and stigma. And those include external distal stressors that come from perpetrators outside but also proximal internalized stressors that come from social culture and history going as far back as I just noted. It's also important to note that coping and social support are important moderators of distress and may ameliorate some of the negative effects of stress. But what is important really to show here is that minority stress is really a moderator of the relationship between social structure, social status and health outcomes. And in that, society takes a major causal role in everything that I do and everything that I think we should be concerned about. I'm going to report on two studies that were funded by the NIH, and those two studies have somewhat different aims, as I will show you in a minute, but you can read more about them on the websites that are listed at the bottom. And they have a lot more information, they have publications, and they also have some information about how to access the data. If anybody is interested in this data, the data is publicly available. For the generation study we separated our sample into three distinct age groups which we defined as related to the discourse around LGBT people at the time where the people in these cohorts were around 10 years old. And we defined three groups. The first one, the older people, were 52 to 59 in 2016 when we began the study, and this group was characterized, and we called it Pride or Identity Formation Generation in that those were main themes around the time. The first Gay Pride March and removal of homosexuality from the DSM were characteristic of that era. The second group were 34 to 41 years old in 2016. And that was a time where AIDS was very much at the center of news, which led to greater visibility as well as institutional advancements for LGBT communities, in particular, to the establishment of health centers and through various, as I said, greater visibility. Much of it was negative and stereotyping but still led to some changes, including through political activism. And the youngest age group which I would focus as a kind of center today for this part of the presentation were people who were 18 to 25 in 2016, and we call them the Equality Generation in that the discourse around them was a lot about demanding equality. In particular, marriage equality was a major topic around those times. And in the generation study, we wanted to basically see something very simple: Has all the changes that we know occurred in American society over the past 60 years led to better social environments, less minority stress and, therefore, better health outcomes? This is basically ‑‑ the minority stress prediction would be as things improve, stress is reduced, and health is improved. We also wanted to see the sense of community identity and LGBT identity of the people because there's been so much increase in the use of labels that some people suggested made LGBT identity itself already obsolete to some extent. So going back to the model, these are some of the ways we measure things. So, in terms of stressors, we looked at physical assault. We also looked at what we called everyday discrimination or, in stress lingo, minor events, such as being insulted. We looked at the internalized levels of stress like internalized homophobia and transphobia. And we also looked at identity, as I mentioned; to what extent people are connected with the identity as an LGBT person, whatever identity level they have, and with the LGBT community as a whole. There are some articles that you can read that address some of the issues that I cover now. And, as I said, the websites that I showed before also have a lot of those publications. So, what we found. There were very significant differences between the three age groups. The diamond with the dark blue represents the younger age group. And as you see, they're much younger in all of the coming‑out events, or coming‑out milestones, as they are called. In particular, if you look at the last line, they're almost 10 years younger when they come out as LGB. And for all the groups, by the way, sex with a partner comes after people identify as LGB. So that is one very distinct difference between the older and younger age groups. But when it comes to other types of experiences like stressors ‑‑ this is the experience of conversion therapy ‑‑ we don't see any significant differences, and certainly we don't see a reduction. In this slide ‑‑ unfortunately the colors changed a little bit. So, Equality is what we call gold at UCLA, the yellow, and the Visibility and Pride, which are the older age groups, are in blue. And you see here that there's not a lot of difference over these many, many decades in terms of how many people are exposed to conversion therapy. In terms of exposure‑to‑violence events, if you just look briefly at the color code that I used, the red indicates a higher level. And without looking at significance level, which many of them are, we see that the Equality or the younger cohort has more experiences of violence compared to the other two cohorts. And certainly, thinking about our hypothesis, there are definitely not less of them. And they're more likely to experience everyday discrimination, being verbally insulted, and also more likely to experience stigma and internalized homophobia. This is the LGB sample. Finally, in terms of psychological distress, we have higher levels of distress ‑‑ that is, depression and anxiety symptoms ‑‑ higher levels of suicide attempts ‑‑ again, this is the younger group ‑‑ and we also looked at the connection between suicide attempt and the age of coming out. And we see for each age group that suicide attempts come after coming out, after realizing that I am gay, lesbian, bisexual. In terms of resources, we did see that strength of gay identity and connection with LGBT community are also strong, which was a little surprising because, as I said, people said, well, now these days people are not identifying with LGBT terms. And we specifically used the term "LGBT community," not queer, not other terms that people might use as individual identity, and show there is still a strong association, which is important because people ‑‑ because all of our efforts to LGBT health interventions come from LGBT community. In terms of the transgender population, we didn't have the same hypothesis that there will be lesser ‑‑ lesser stress in the younger generations because we haven't seen a great reduction in attitude towards transgender people. But we did see that in all of the measures that we used, they are much more likely than cisgender straight people to have experienced stress, and they're also much more likely ‑‑ sorry ‑‑ to experience mental and physical health outcomes. And, again, those studies are available for you to review if you're interested. Finally, we also found challenges in healthcare outcome and healthcare access. And I know my time is up now, but I look forward to talking about it more later as we discuss these issues. Thank you. PARISA PARSAFAR: Thank you so much, Dr. Meyer. And now we'll pass it over to Dr. Alexi Potter. ALEXI POTTER: Hello, everybody. It is just a pleasure to be here today. Let me grab my slides up here. They did not appear. Hold on just a moment. Here we go. I'm really excited to be here. Thank you for ‑‑ to everyone who has organized this and is attending this workshop. It really is an exciting event. What I'm going to talk to you today about is really about a resource, and that resource is something Dr. Compton already mentioned, which is the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. And I think it's a unique resource that we can use to understand wellness in GSM youth. Just disclosures of funding there. And I will try to do a heroic thing, which is to tell you about the ABCD study in, like, one or two minutes. Please go to the website. If you're interested, it's on the next slide. But for people who don't know, ABCD is a longitudinal neuroimaging study, enrolled 11,878 youths in 2015. All youths were nine or ten when they were enrolled. They're at 21 sites across the country. And the idea is to follow them longitudinally to assess and characterize typical development trajectories and factors that influence development. The demographics of ABCD matched the ACS, when we recruited, of nine‑ and ten‑year‑olds. And the study right now in the bottom of the slide here is the timeline of the ABCD study, and the red arrow is where we are now. Now, of course it spans a little bit, but we're finishing up six‑year follow‑ups and we're running eight‑year follow‑ups. So, we're kind of in this spot. And the most important thing about ABCD is it's done with a full open science model, so there are annual data releases of all of the data. ABCD is a very broad assessment battery. So, you can see that we are assessing all types of things. And in blue is what I'm going to be talking about, which is our measures of gender identity and sexual health. Each of these domains are overseen in a workgroup structure, so there's a workgroup ‑‑ there are workgroup chairs and then people with domain expertise. We also have members of the consortia research staff there. And ABCD is done under a U mechanism, so there's also NIH representation as well. Once the workgroup has come up with a proposed battery, it goes to all of the investigators and then, finally, voted on by a steering committee. And so, I'm going to tell you a little bit about the work we're doing in the gender identity and sexual health workgroup. This workgroup is a partnership with the CDC. They approached ABCD and said the Division of Adolescent and School Health at CDC would really like to partner with you to improve measurement of gender and sexuality. And so that has really been a huge benefit here. So, the charge of this workgroup is to recommend developmentally sensitive assessments of gender and sexuality and to provide ongoing QC and monitoring of these data. I'm going to take a quick break and just want to always talk a little bit about definitions, so you know what I mean. And as I'm talking through my slides, I always show the gender unicorn because I think it really perfectly helps us understand that these things are ‑‑ that these constructs are dimensional and that everybody belongs on every line in this chart at some point. We'll be talking ‑‑ as I show you ABCD data, we're talking about gender identity, gender diversity, and about sexual orientation. So how do we measure gender in ABCD? So, we're taking a few approaches. When the study started, we didn't actually have the gender identity and sexual health workgroup. It was formed after the study started. So, at the baseline visit, the only question about gender as to the youth was "Are your transgender" with answers of "Yes," "Maybe," "No," "I don't understand this question" and "Refuse." Once the GISH workgroup joined, we met with community partners and decided to measure felt gender. So, beginning at the one‑year follow‑up and asked every year since, all youth are asked "How much do you feel like a boy" and "How much do you feel like a girl" so that ‑‑ and the order of those is determined so the gender that is typical of your sex appears first. It's important to mention that felt gender is not gender identity. Gender identity is an internal thing where you're claiming a gender or choosing a term to use. So, this is not that. But we wondered, at this young age, if people could report on their gender and let us get ‑‑ would that maybe be a precursor to identity. Starting at the three‑year follow‑up we have moved to the gold standard, keeping the other measures as well, but that's the two‑step gender identity question where we ask, "What was your sex assigned at birth" and "What is your current gender identity." We've published the results of that recently, showing that that is very understandable to youth in the ABCD study and can be really useful for identifying SGM youth. I want to pause for a minute and tell you about the felt gender results because I think this is really exciting. So, this is at ages 10 and 11, the first year that we did this. And the way that this works is across the top are people's ratings of how much they feel like the gender associated with their sex assigned at birth typically, and down the column here is how much people feel like the gender that's not typically associated with their sex assigned at birth. The most important things to notice are, first, there are numbers in every single cell. When you give youth the opportunity to have a dimensional response for these options, they use them. Also, 1% ‑‑ a little over 1% of youth declined to answer one or both items. So very high acceptance and understanding by the youth. Next, when we look at the numbers, in this top left corner you'll see that 80% of kids respond in a way that's really typical of the binary, feeling totally like they're in line with the gender associated with sex assigned at birth and not at all like the opposite gender. And then as you move out, you can see the percentages change. We ‑‑ this 1‑step, 2‑step and gender minority is just a rubric we've placed on there to understand this better. It doesn't ‑‑ people can analyze this data any way they want, and there's a lot of information in here. And I'll just show you briefly what this looks like three years later when youth are 14 and 15. And what we see is, again, every cell has numbers in it, and our "totally" group, "totally," "not at all," kind of binary gender group is still at around 80%. But the real change has happened that people are responding in the 1‑step, 2‑step and gender minority more evenly distributed. So, I'm just going to go back to show you that here we had 9% in this 1‑step, so close, feeling mostly like their sex assigned at birth and not at all like the opposite or feeling a little like the sex not assigned at birth but totally like their sex assigned at birth. So, we had nine and then five and four. And then two years later we have a much more even distribution here. We did an initial look at does felt gender have a signal, is it representing something? And what we see is that even at that 1‑step level, so feeling very aligned with your sex assigned at birth but not entirely anchored, there are measurable differences in mental health problems rated by parents. And that goes along with that continuum. And finally, ‑‑ so if you're interested in using this data, here are the response rates up through the four‑year follow‑up. So, the "Are your transgender" is the only thing we had at baseline, and you can see that at the four‑year follow‑up, about 3% of youth are saying either yes or maybe. The 2‑step gender identity, which wasn't added until three years but is available for those ‑‑ for three‑ and four‑year shows the rates there at four years, about 5% of the sample. And the way that we identified SGM youth at that point is described here at the bottom. So, we took anyone who said they were another gender, for example, nonbinary, plus any responses ‑‑ any boy or girl responses that were not typical of the sex assigned at birth. And, finally, using that felt gender, if you look at people just in the pink on those graphs I showed before at the farthest away step, we have about 8% of youth. So, what we see is that youth are really identifying with gender as a dimensional construct. And I think that gives us a really unique opportunity to study the development of gender among a large typically developing cohort that is not enhanced or recruited for gender diversity. Finally, I'm going to move to the measures of sexual orientation here. And so, again, at baseline we have the item from the KSADS background, which is "Are you guy or bisexual," single item, with "Yes," "Maybe," "No," "I don't understand" and "Refuse to answer." Starting at ‑‑ after that we've added the sexual orientation questions. So, we asked "Which of these bests describe you." The preamble is "People vary in their sexual attraction to other people. Which of this best describes you?" And the answers there are "Gay or Lesbian," "Bisexual," "Unsure," "I use another term," "I don't understand the question" and "Decline to answer." And, finally, the kind of equivalent or we think could be related to that felt gender for picking up those early attraction, we asked three separate questions. So, everybody answers, "I'm attracted to girls" from "Not at all," "A little," "A lot", "I don't know," and "Decline to answer." Same question for "I'm attracted to boys" and "I'm attracted to people who are another gender," for example, nonbinary. When we look to see the prevalence rate in ABCD, we see that the method that you use to assess it doesn't seem to matter as much. So, if I start at the right‑hand side at this five‑year mark, the item from the KSADS identified 25% of youth. The more kind of gold standard option of which of these describes you is identifying 28% of the youth with 12% identifying as bisexual, 4% as gay or lesbian. And, finally, if you look at attraction ‑‑ and the way we were looking at that is including as sexual minority people who have ‑‑ who endorse attraction to people who are another gender ‑‑ for example, nonbinary ‑‑ plus people who have answers that are greater than none for the gender that's not associated with a heterosexual attraction. And I just want to give a thank you to all of my team at UVM ‑‑ we are in Vermont, so we make tie‑dyes ‑‑ and to everyone involved. I'm happy to provide any more information if people want to get in touch. And I will stop now and introduce you to Dr. Matthews. DERRICK MATTHEWS: Thank you so much. Let me pull up my slides. Happy Pride Month and thank you to the NIMH for the opportunity to speak at this meeting today about the research that we do at The Trevor Project, mental health and suicide with LGBTQ+ young people. And so today I'd like for us to just briefly make sure we're all aware of what The Trevor Project does and kind of why we do research, the National Survey on Mental Health, I'll go over some key findings and results and then talk about some of the methodological advances of large data analysis that we do. But before we get going, I want to do a quick kind of introduction. I won't read all these, but I do think it's just important that we acknowledge and kind of ‑‑ that we bring ourselves to this work in a full way. And I was really encouraged to hear from Dr. Webb Hooper about the idea that we really need to invest in training and diverse workforce. And so, for me it's important that I acknowledge that my positionality in this work as a Black, gay, cisgender man, you know, this work is very important to me, and I think it's also critical for how we all collectively humanize this research and humanize the voices of LGBTQ+ young people that we seek to represent and serve with our science. And so, The Trevor Project, our goal is really ‑‑ we're the leading suicide prevention organization for LGBTQ+ young people, and the goal is to really just make sure that everyone can see a bright future for themselves. And so, we're probably best known for our very important crisis services, which really are aimed at helping anyone in distress or crisis. So, this is our ‑‑ folks can call in or text or reach out through mobile or the web to speak to a trained counselor and support. But we also have a lot of activities that are geared towards suicide prevention, and that's the orientation in which all of our research activities are based. So, our goal is to really make sure not only that folks have an avenue for when they are in crisis, but we do those things that are required to really reduce the risk of folks needing to use our services in the first place. And in terms of our research mission, we broadly kind of think about this in three buckets. The first is our knowledge acquisition, and this is where we are really dedicated with everything, we do from our monthly research briefs to writing reports to peer‑reviewed manuscripts, and we really want to help do our part in advancing the scientific knowledge related to the mental health of LGBTQ+ young people. The second is internal knowledge sharing. And this what makes sure our research actually also supports the activities that go on in our organization so that everything from our crisis services to our advocacy is also data‑driven and informed by research. And then, lastly, external knowledge sharing. So, we want to make sure that what we're learning in our research activities is accessible to folks outside of Trevor and anyone who wants to really kind of take our work and support their own work in supporting the health and wellness of LGBTQ+ young people. And so today I'm going to really just go over our key findings in the most recent national survey that we did, the 2024 U.S. National Survey on Mental Health of LGBTQ+ Young People, and you can access all of these online at any time through the trevorproject.org. And we also have ‑‑ we maintain all of the previous year's results as well. So, if that's ever anything folks are interested in, please feel free to kind of check that out at your own convenience. And just as a brief overview of our methodology, we ‑‑ all of our study participants respond online, and so we recruit for a few months. This year it was from September through December of 2023 via targeted ads on social media. And so, we also made sure that we engaged in targeted recruitment so that we could really try to do our best and make sure that we have a sufficient sample size with respect to a variety of characteristics; specifically, geography, gender identity, and race and ethnicity. This year we were able to end up with a final sample of over 18,000 LGBTQ+ young people who were between the ages of 13 to 24 who live in the United States. And so, folks who kind of are eligible and complete ‑‑ they complete a survey, and this includes about 134 sub questions. And so, this is not a quick survey, but ‑‑ which is why we realize the importance of ‑‑ that we really kind of disseminate what we learn and that we're really appreciative of all the young people who kind of really took the time to complete the survey. And the survey is offered every year in English and Spanish as well. Again, you can see our more detailed methodology on our website. And know that everything was approved by an independent institutional review board. And, also, when I start sharing results, just to be clear, so we're using kind of the umbrella term "transgender and nonbinary" to really help us identify quickly any non‑cisgendered young people in our survey. And so, this includes other labels that folks have identified, including gender queer, agender, gender fluid, and et cetera. And I think kind of the top‑line planning that's really hard to hear but is also really important that I think we keep saying, so nearly four in ten LGBTQ+ young people in our survey say that they seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year, and that 12% of LGBTQ+ young people said that they have attempted suicide the past year. And I think it's easy to agree that these numbers are just far too high, and we all know that a huge reason for this is the sort of adverse experiences that the young people in the survey face due to their LGBTQ+ identity. And so, I'm going to quickly go through some of the demographic differences just so we can kind of get a sense of what's happening. And so, we see that it's really the younger folks in our sample, those less than 18, that are the ones that are more likely to consider and attempt suicide in the last year. So those are really the folks that are often not represented in research because they may be harder to access, but we can see here that they're the ones who really are in need of our services and efforts. And we also see some important differences by sexual orientation. Specifically, I want to highlight that folk who identified as queer, pansexual, or questioning were the ones that really had the average highest rates of considering and attempting suicide. And so, as we think about our research agenda moving forward, it's really important that we do a good job in making sure we capture diverse sexual orientation because the ones that we maybe have historically not done a great job of assessing may be the very folks who are kind of at the highest risk and, again, need services. Again, by gender identity we're seeing, unfortunately, that transgender and nonbinary, queer, and questioning young people were the ones who had the highest rates of considering suicide and attempting suicide in the last year. And by race and ethnicity, we definitely see kind of some patterns here, specifically where the Native and Indigenous LGBTQ+ young folks in our sample had overwhelmingly the highest rates of considering suicide and attempting suicide in the past year, and also those who identify as multiracial. So, these were certainly the two groups that kind of stood out in terms of race and ethnicity. And then, lastly, we also see that a majority of LGBTQ+ young people in our sample had reported experiences of anxiety and that a little over half, 53%, had also reported experiences, recent symptoms of depression. And for these we used the GAD‑2 and the PHQ‑2 validated instruments to assess this. And so understanding that the rates of these are so high may also help us understand kind of increased rates that we see in suicide consideration and attempts. I also wanted to take a moment to acknowledge that it can be really easy for us to kind of forget, especially when we're communicating to other audiences, that this isn't about kind of individual ‑‑ anything is wrong with folks, but oftentimes these are antagonistic policies driving this. And so, a lot of folks said their well‑being is negatively impacted by politics and that folks would consider leaving the state. And so, one advantage of using this data is we have the ability for increased statistical power to detect differences. Because we don't include cisgender straight respondents, we can ask questions that are more specific to queer experiences that might not be practical for larger surveys and that, again, we can disentangle experiences of different diverse subgroups. And so, here's just a brief breakdown of some of our demographics. And I just want to point this out because it just shows that we have the capacity to really look at subgroups without having to worry that we may not have sufficient sample size to do analyses. And this is particularly important for me in terms of race/ethnicity given what we know about intersectionality and its consequences for health. And so, for example, while we have less than 1% of our sample who identify as Middle Eastern or North African, it still gives us enough sample size to be able to do a kind of focused analysis on groups that may not have historically been considered a lot in LGBTQ+ health research. And, again, depending on our sort of research questions, we can use this large data set to allow for a lot of different types of analyses. Control variables and regression models are typical, but we're looking also now at interacting with other variables, stratification, and intergroup analysis. And despite all of these advantages, we do realize that large cross‑sectional data is not kind of the end‑all and be‑all of research, so we'll be actually moving from doing this study every year to every other year, and we're excited that now we're going to be engaging in several different studies such as longitudinal research, qualitative research, and also disentangling all of our results at a state‑by‑state level, and then we'll be doing our next survey the following year in 2026. And so, I want to thank you all for your time, looking forward to the discussion later, and I'll pass it on to Dr. Olson‑Kennedy. JOHANNA OLSON‑KENNEDY: Thank you so much. I really appreciate the opportunity to be here this morning. I'm going to share my slides. I hope that people can see these. Okay. So, I'm going to talk today about a few things. Just for recognition, my name is Johanna Olson‑Kennedy. I am the medical director of the Center for Trans Youth, Health and Development at Children's Hospital, Los Angeles, I use she/her pronouns, I've been doing gender work for the past 18 years, and then I want to talk about a few things that we've discovered in our research. But I want to start out by talking about some of the challenges related to research involving trans and nonbinary youth because this is coming up a lot, I think for me in court cases, but has been kind of a common thing that I've heard. And the first issue is that the numbers of youth that are accessing services are very small. This was a study ‑‑ these are numbers from a study that was commissioned by Reuters, done by Komodo Health, looking at the numbers of people who started puberty blockers in the U.S. between 2017 and 2021. These were considered the first five years of the real increase in the numbers of people accessing services; but, even so, you can see that these numbers are quite small. Less than 5,000 people, possibly a few more from years earlier than that, but not a lot more. Young people who started getting gender‑affirming hormones is around 14,000. There's some overlap because some of those individuals were getting both puberty blockers and hormone therapy. I think it's important to understand this research endeavor identified just over 120,000 young people had received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria in these years, and we're talking about less than ‑‑ around 10% of them getting access to services, which is a really small number. So, trying to create ‑‑ trying to create large longitudinal datasets is really difficult, and it necessitates multi‑site studies, and those studies are very expensive. So, there are some other issues related to research in this population. Longitudinal data is ‑‑ beyond about five to seven years is not going to be available for a while because especially the utilization of puberty blockers in trans and nonbinary young people is relatively new, especially in the numbers that we need to collect this data, and so we rely on extrapolation from other populations to answer some of our questions. The use of puberty blockers as monotherapies ‑‑ so young people who only use puberty blockers ‑‑ it is a small amount of time, relative, so you're not going to necessarily get a lot of information about puberty blockers alone. Youth who are progressing to going to hormones are going to age out of pediatric and adolescent care, which also challenges collection of longitudinal data. I think probably people know this, but randomized control trials are an untreated control arm ‑‑ or unrealistic and unethical in the population of trans and nonbinary young people, because the interventions exist. There've been a lot of data about the benefit of these interventions, and so it's very unlikely that people are gonna participate in a potentially untreated control arm of a study. The current bans on youth care have diminished our opportunities for research in a lot of sections of the country. The other thing is there's a strong commitment from anti‑trans groups to misinterpret findings. So, it kind of curtails or certainly puts a limitation on the kinds of data and it creates a lot of distress in thinking about how to talk about the results in a way that isn't going to be misinterpreted. The trans youth care United States study thankfully funded by the NIH that started in 2015 is the largest prospective cohort of trans and nonbinary youth. It is an observational study looking at the physiologic, anthropometric and psychological impact of medical interventions on youth who are new to gender‑affirming hormones and youth who are new to GnRH analogs or puberty blockers. You can see the Forsyth here, Benioff Children's Hospital in San Francisco, our site in Los Angeles, Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago, and the Boston Children's Hospital in Boston. The cohorts consist of 94 young people who initiated GnRH analogs for puberty suppression and the parents and guardians of each of those young people and 315 young people who are starting gender‑affirming hormones. We've completed visits actually through your forum and are now starting to collect eight‑year data on some of our original participants. Today, I'm going to be showing you data from the youth who initiated GnRH analogs and our observations about their mental health over time. I think it's really important to tell everyone who is on this webinar that these are unpublished data. They have not been peer‑reviewed yet, but I did want to share some of our preliminary findings related to two‑year data after initiating puberty blockers. Here are the demographics of that cohort. We used designated sex at birth, because there are multiple identity labels that people use, but it is impossible to do analysis with all of those different labels, which is unfortunate. I have issues and thoughts about anchoring to designated sex at birth, but for the purposes of analysis, especially in a smaller cohort such as this, we really have to lean into that. What is important about this cohort, I think, is really relevant for us to think about. I've heard a few of my co‑presenters talk about this, that the majority of people who were in this particular study are non‑Hispanic or non‑Latino white and this is related to and mirrors what we see across clinical sites as well. And this is really important for all of us to be thinking about, because it is our job collectively as clinicians and researchers to understand why this phenomenon is happening and increase access for youth from communities of color to this very critical intervention for people. We use a lot of data collection measures, but I wanted to talk about the things that folks are maybe more familiar with. The CBCL ‑‑ so remember this parental report of youth, and across the board you can see that the only clinically significant change was a decrease in rule‑breaking behavior. I'm going to caveat this by saying, however, that these measures right here are the separate subdomains of the CBCL. The green area on the graph is representational of non‑clinically concerning ranges. So, while we may see a small increase in some of these things and a small decrease in some of these things, the young people who are starting out on puberty blockers are in the non‑clinically concerning range at the baseline and they are at the non‑clinically concerning range at 24 months. Everything in red is the clinically concerning range. I think this is one of those things I'm delighted to talk about, because the young people in this study are starting out in really good shape and they are 24 months later in really good shape. Okay, here is ‑‑ I thought it was important also to talk about the youth reporting on themselves. The NIH Emotional Health Toolbox is really important for determining specific things such as friendship and perceived rejection, perceived hostility, self‑esteem, loneliness, emotional support. All of those are in that upper cluster and then BDIY, or measures of depression, are that last line. And again, just to reiterate the importance of these findings, emotional support, self‑efficacy and friendship all are clinically concerning as some of these T scores are lower than 40, and you can see that in this group, you see improvement in ‑‑ none of these are statistically significant either, or all of these measures are in a non‑clinically concerning range. And the same is true for loneliness, perceived rejection and perceived hostility ‑‑ again, no significant changes, but beginning below concerning range and remaining at below concerning range. These are really important findings. I moved the BDIY into T scores, so people could take a look at this as well. 70 plus is extremely elevated; 60 to 69, moderately elevated; 55 to 59, mildly elevated, and 55 or less is the average score. So, these young people who are getting the opportunity to get blockers are doing really well, but I think it also would be remiss not to talk about the fact that if young people have access to blockers in early puberty, which this cohort did, they also have parental support that is a proxy. When people have access to puberty blockers, they are much more likely to have parental support just because of the fact that they're younger and someone needs to be listening and hearing them about their gender and accessing medical care. We know that this is a very small number of people who have this opportunity, but this opportunity is a complete trajectory changer for people, specifically for trans‑feminine people, because we know that if they go through a testosterone‑dominant puberty, there are things that they're not gonna be able to walk back. Thank you very much. I appreciate this opportunity to talk about this and want to leave you with, while the use of puberty blockers has been fundamentally attacked and the source of so much distress in the media, especially right‑wing media, it is really important that we maintain this opportunity for people. And I am pleased to hand the mic over to Dr. Gregory Phillips. GREGORY PHILLIPS: Thank you. Okay. So, thank you for having me. I'm excited to be on this panel to talk a bit about some of the work that my team and I have been doing in the measurement space. So as has already been highlighted a bit earlier, although we know adolescence and young adult is a critical time for development of sexual orientation and gender identity, we know that few systems are really well‑equipped to capture accurate and useful data. A lot of my work focuses on the Youth Risk Behavior Survey. I'm happy to have heard people talk a bit about YRBS and I'm happy that we have someone from DASH here to be the discussant for this panel, because I think YRBS is one of the fundamental datasets we use to understand SGM trends in youth. So, for those who don't know, YRBS is a CDC‑funded biennial study that assesses health behaviors among high school‑aged youth in the United States. There are two different versions of it, the national YRBS survey created by the CDC and then there's a jurisdictional or local version that states and cities can alter some questions or administer their own versions. So YRBS covers a bunch of topics, from basic demographic information to violence, victimization, substance use, sexual health. In 2015 sexual orientation questions were first added to the national YRBS, and then in 2017 the transgender identity or gender modality question was piloted in a subset of jurisdictions. So, one of the things that my team and I focused a lot on and has been a source of confusion for many of us is this "not sure" category in the YRBS. So, in 2019, 3.2 percent of high school students said that they were not sure in response to the sexual orientation question, and this is confusing because it could be interpreted as the students were questioning their sexual orientation; they didn't understand what the question meant, or they didn't know how to respond since none of the available categories are accurate. So thankfully YRBS updated this question in 2021 that will help reduce interpretation. We recently published a note on this in JAMA Pediatrics. So here you can see what the sexual identity question was prior to 2021. There were four options ‑‑ heterosexual (straight), gay or lesbian, bisexual, or not sure. In 2021, "not sure" was broken out into three new categories ‑‑ "I describe my sexual identity some other way; I'm not sure about my sexual identity or questioning; and I do not know what this question is asking." So, this lets us understand more what goes into this "not sure" category. And I don't expect you to read all of this or anything. What I really want you to focus on is really the bottom three lines, which is where what was originally "not sure" is broken out, and you can see how much of a difference there is in each of these categories. Back in 2019, a total of 4 percent of youth said that they were not sure. When we get to 2021, this number goes up really high. We have 5 percent who identify as questioning; 3.5 percent who describe their sexual identity some other way, and a smaller number, about 1.8 percent, who don't know what the question is asking. And as we all know, there are a lot of differences by sex. So, numbers are smaller among males than among females, and this is really the first time we're able to see what this "not sure" category actually means. The other thing that YRBS asks about, as I mentioned, was gender identity. So here you can see the transgender question that was piloted in 2017. "Some people describe themselves as transgender when their sex at birth does not match the way they think or feel about their gender. Are your transgender?" This question is fairly typical. The issue, however, is once we pair it with the sex question. So YRBS asks, "What is your sex, male or female?" And while the transgender question lets us identify who transgender is, we can't really say if somebody is trans‑male or trans‑female and it's hard to distinguish who nonbinary or other gender is‑diverse identities. And it gets really complicated especially when you're submitting papers for review when people are trying to insist that sex is assigned at birth, which we can't really assume in this space. So YRBS is a great dataset for understanding more population trends. I was funded during the COVID‑19 pandemic through the RADx‑UP initiative to really study the impact of COVID‑19 on youth and young adults, focused primarily on multiply‑minoritized individuals ‑‑ so sexual and gender minority individuals, racial and ethnic minority individuals ‑‑ and we conducted a study with 1,055 youth ages 14 to 24 throughout the United States. So, again, not wanting you to read everything, but some best practices or recommendations we have for collecting measures. So sexual orientation, we have a "choose all that apply" option. We use "not listed" instead of "other." We also know that for epidemiologists, for anyone who works with quantitative data, it can be really hard to quantify who falls into a category if they respond to multiple options. So, we give them this follow‑up question also, "If you were forced to pick one term, which would you pick?" So, we give them the option to identify as both, so that we're able to capture that. So, we ask about sexual orientation this way. We also ask about sex assigned at birth, pretty standard. We actually make sure it's mentioned as birth certificate. We include intersex identity. We know that intersex questions are often left off surveys. So, it's really important to make sure we're asking people if they identify as intersex, and this question we have adapted from our work with Interact. And then gender identity, we ask about what their current gender identity is. Again, we have the "choose all that apply," but then we give them the option to select only one. If they choose more than one, then we ask about gender modality. So, we're able to put gender ‑‑ sex assigned at birth. People don't need to say what their sex assigned at birth is, so we are able to use the gender modality paired with their gender identity to figure out what they would identify as. And just some overall breakdown of our cohort. We had pretty high diversity across all of these questions. So, about a quarter of our 1,055 were transgender. We had 16% who identified as nonbinary. A third were trans or gender diverse. We had a wide array of different identities. More than a third were bi or pansexual, five percent were asexual or Ace spectrum, 14 percent were queer. We also did a qualitative substudy of the work to figure out how the COVID‑19 pandemic impacted youth and young adults, knowing that people were impacted differently depending on what their identities were, where they lived, and we interviewed 34 individuals from 18 states in 2021. So, we found some differential impacts, but there's a lot of focus on transition. So, shifts in time, shifts in living situations, shifts in community support systems, and shifts in climate, both political and social. So, unsurprisingly, the pandemic exacerbated existing stigmatization and introduced new forms of social and policy control, which helped to further isolate LGBTQ+ youth. This loss of autonomy and increased stigmatization was linked to poor mental health outcomes. So, the need to protect a person's mental health and safety often overshadowed opportunities for identity exploration and development, and the pandemic unsurprisingly disrupted typical developmental processes, such as identity formation, autonomy seeking, and community in general that people would normally have in‑person, which could have and likely has had long‑term mental health consequences for these youth. So, we think that a lot of the pandemic had negative impacts on youth, and we were right about that. We also found some positives. So, the two quotes on the left were supportive findings. So, both of these people were able to find some positive out of the pandemic. The first person talked about going on Reddit to find people like themselves, to help find a community, to have people to fall back to, to help really develop their identity. That's also what comes out with the bottom one. The person was able to really solidify their identity and they were able to take the opportunity to come out to their relatives. Whereas the ones on the right had a very different experience. So, people had to go home, they moved in with their parents, they moved to less accepting areas. People had to go back into the closet. People had to go into hospitals to deal with mental health challenges, and this was a challenge for a lot of people. So, what can we do with all of this? Make the most of existing data. So YRBS is a great dataset. There are some issues, but there are issues with any dataset. So, we tried to make the most of it. We were able to find trends, we were able to talk about data. I use it all the time. I think it's a great dataset and I think it's one of the best places to really find where the critical points are that are impacting youth. Advocate for all systems to use an expansive list of sexual orientation and gender identity questions. So, you've heard this earlier; I'm sure you're gonna hear it throughout the workshop, but really giving autonomy and power to the youth to pick multiple terms and to self‑identify with terms that really reflect who they are, recognizing that identity can change over time. I see so many systems that are only built to collect data at one time point, and we want to make sure that we can collect data over time. And prioritize qualitative and mixed‑method approaches to contextualize our findings. So, thank you for your time and your attention. I want to thank my team for their help in putting together this presentation, and I will turn it over to Dr. Strang for our final presentation. JOHN STRANG: Great, thank you. I'm John Strang. I use he/him pronouns, and I'm the director of the gender and autism program at Children's National. I'm also a research director for our gender development program. And here are my disclosures. So, this final talk for the first panel is dedicated to the common intersection of autism and gender diversity. So why a talk dedicated specifically to autistic transgender and gender‑diverse people? Well, since as long as about 20 years ago, gender‑supporting clinicians have been discussing their observations that a substantial subset of gender‑diverse and transgender individuals are autistic or have notable autistic traits. As of 2024, there are more than 50 studies reporting on the common overlap of autism and gender diversity. Kelatonaki and Williams' 2023 meta-analysis estimated that across studies, 11 percent of gender‑diverse people have been diagnosed autistic. This is in contrast to estimates of autism in the general population. The current estimate is that about 2.3 percent of the general population is autistic. Now, the intersection between autism and gender diversity appears to exist at the trait level as well in the non‑clinical general population. A series of studies in youth and adults have reported significant relationships between autistic traits and gender diversity traits among people who are not diagnosed autistic and who do not identify as gender‑diverse or transgender. As many of you probably know, we are learning that autism can present quite differently based on assigned sex and gender. For example, autism may be more easily missed or late‑diagnosed in cisgender girls and women. Late diagnosis of autism appears to be a particularly common feature among gender‑diverse and transgender people. A recently published study presented here identifies a four to six‑year timing disparity in the age of autism diagnosis when comparing gender‑diverse and cisgender youth and adults. In the left panel, we see the autism diagnostic ages for a clinical sample of 1,550 autistic youth. The red circle highlights the approximate six‑year age difference in autism diagnostic age between cisgender and gender‑diverse young people. The right panel shows a community‑based replication sample of 244 individuals diagnosed autistic. Here, we see about a four‑year gap in autism diagnostic timing between cisgender and gender‑diverse groups. Importantly, in both samples retrospective autism diagnostic dates were obtained, as some individuals are diagnosed autistic before they come to know that they are transgender. Now, autism diagnostic timing disparities are concerning and especially in transgender youth, who may already face a range of gender minority stressors. This is because late autism diagnosis means missed opportunities for critical early neurodiversity‑related accommodations and supports. Also, late autism diagnosis is associated with greater mental health burden and poorer adult quality of life. Several reasons have been hypothesized for late autism identification and diagnosis in gender‑diverse individuals. First, social and developmental differences in transgender youth may be attributed to gender minority stress. It is not uncommon for transgender kids to be late‑referred for autism‑related supports, because families, schools and providers may at first assume that the young person's social challenges are related to the stress of fitting in as a transgender child. Another hypothesis for late autism diagnosis in gender‑diverse people is related to cognitive ability. Emerging evidence suggests that higher verbal IQ is associated with later autism diagnosis. Interestingly, Thomas and colleagues, as well as collaboration with our group, recently published a study of polygenic profiles across cisgender and gender‑diverse individuals and identified that the polygenic propensity for higher cognitive ability was related to aspects of self‑reported gender diversity. It is also important to note that autism presentations other than the traditional well‑known cisgender male profile are often later diagnosed, and this is in part because of the signs of autism in people of other genders, which are less well‑recognized by clinicians, schools, families, and providers. And, finally, there is a clinical phenomenon described by gender care providers of a substantial subset of transgender youth appearing to be right at the edge or margin of an autism diagnosis. Being at the margin of autism may lead to a late diagnosis, as notable challenges may appear for a young person only when social demands increase in middle childhood or adolescence. In this work presented here, we were interested in this full range of autism presentations among transgender youth, with a particular focus on the many transgender youth who appear to be at the edge of an autism diagnosis. We used an enriched autism recruitment approach, and through comprehensive autism‑related assessment, we classified the transgender young people into one of three groups ‑‑ those who met full criteria for autism, those who were at the margin of an autism diagnosis, called here slightly subclinical autism, and those who were not autistic. This was a functional MRI study and we focused on default mode functional connectivity. Connectivity with a default mode network has in previous studies demonstrated to differentiate autistic versus non‑autistic individuals. Pictured in the five panels on the right are connectivity findings across five neural regions, showing differences between autistic and non‑autistic transgender youth. You'll notice in the panels this type of stair‑stepping pattern between the three groups, with the non‑autistic group pictured in the lightest gray showing the least amount of functional connectivity: the slightly subclinical group showing somewhat greater functional connectivity ‑‑ that's in the medium gray ‑‑ and the full criteria autistic group showing the most extreme functional connectivity, and that's in the dark gray. These patterns align with existing literature on autistic functional connectivity patterns in youth of similar age. There are two key conclusions from this work. First, gold standard autism assessments with transgender youth, such as used in this study, may well be identifying true autism in these kids because neural patterns previously associated with autism are observed in those transgender youth who are diagnosed autistic with gold standard measures. Second, the observation of a slightly subclinical autistic group of transgender youth may be accurate. This group showed neural patterns that fall in between the autistic and non‑autistic youth, and the presence of this almost‑autistic group does make sense conceptually given that autism traits and gender diversity traits appear related in the general population. So, autism at multiple levels may be enriched in gender‑diverse populations. So, this brings us to a possible classification system for autism among gender‑diverse individuals. Clearly, the majority of gender‑diverse individuals are not autistic. Then there is a subset of transgender people who have clear autistic traits, and we might call this the broad autism phenotype, but there is no functional or clinical impact. We also identify a subgroup who are at the margin of an autism diagnosis. Early research with this subgroup reports notable mental health burden for these individuals; yet they may fall through the cracks in terms of diagnostics, accommodations, and supports. And finally, we have the sizable minority who are diagnosed autistic. Over the years, there has been a great deal of philosophizing about the nature of this autism and gender diversity co‑occurrence. Two primary theories have emerged. First, some have suggested a deep biological link, such as specific prenatal hormone levels that may increase the likelihood of both autism and gender diversity. There has been work studying prenatal hormone levels and later diagnosis of autism, but to study this in the intersection of autism and gender diversity would be very difficult given the required timelines and sample size. Another theory, which in part comes from the autistic transgender community itself, is that autistic people may be less driven by or moored to social gender norms and this greater distance from social gender expectation may result in broader gender expressions and identities. However, there is community concern with asking questions about etiology. Some advocates in the autistic transgender community have spoken about a double standard put on autistic transgender people. For example, is there research into the, quote, etiology of being gay? Do providers need to understand the, quote, cause of being gay in order to provide appropriate care? Probably not. Autistic transgender advocates have said that the same approach should apply to the autism and gender diversity intersection, that there should be no research focused on the cause, but instead that we should acknowledge that this intersection is a common feature of human diversity and that the focus of research should be on the needs of autistic transgender people. And there has been some early work to understand the experiences and needs of autistic transgender people. Here is our first mixed‑method study of autistic transgender youth which identified several clinical themes, and of those themes, one of them was the impact of neurodiversity. I'm going to share with you the words of an autistic transgender young man talking about the impact of neurodiversity as a trans man. He said, "It is a paradox of self‑awareness, because autism, I think, makes you less aware of your emotions, and to know that you are trans means that you have to be incredibly cognizant of your own mental state and your identity. So, it's difficult for that reason and it's difficult to plan for all the sort of details and process of being trans, like getting appropriate treatment, changing documents, talking to people about getting accommodations ‑‑ like getting the bathroom at school ‑‑ is more difficult if you're on the autism spectrum." I'm going to finish today with some big‑picture ideas of why it may be important for those of us doing clinical and research work with gender‑diverse communities to think about the proportional overrepresentation of autism among gender‑diverse populations. First, it is important to personalize care given emerging evidence of unique clinical needs of autistic transgender people. Second, it is important to characterize and account for the proportional overrepresentation of autism and autistic traits in our studies of transgender populations, as autism may explain important variability in outcomes, and this could very much impact the interpretation of study findings. And finally, it may be important to consider the common intersection in light of the current social and political context. Specifically, autistic transgender people are increasingly mentioned in transgender limiting legislation, either as a group that is intentionally restricted or as a justification for restricting care for all youth, as seen in the Georgia law. Yet, neither of the two studies investigating shifts in gender‑related medical requests in autistic versus non‑autistic individuals reported autistic gender‑diverse individuals as significantly more likely to experience shifts or regret. Clearly, more research is needed on the longitudinal gender trajectories and needs of autistic gender‑diverse people and a critical part of this work will be consideration of how ableism may be driving assumptions about this population. Thank you. PARISA PARSAFAR: Thank you so much, Dr. Strang. And now I'll invite all the speakers to turn on your cameras and unmute your mics to engage in the discussion, and we have Dr. Kathleen Ethier leading the discussion today. KATHLEEN ETHIER: Good afternoon, I'm Kathleen Ethier. I use her/her pronouns. I am the director of the Division of Adolescent and School Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I'm really so excited to be with you today and to have gotten a chance to get a little bit of a preview of the presentations today and the opportunity to just say a few words and also really welcome presenters to join in the conversation. The first thing I wrote down as the session started was, is it getting better? And I know the question was, is it getting better for LGBTQI young people and certainly want to address that question, but I also want to step back and just talk about the question, is the work getting better? And from the vantage point of the number of years I've been in this field and have watched the arc of research and the surveillance and other kinds of data questions, it is absolutely getting better. It is the quality of the research that ‑‑ and I know that what we've been talking about today is the tip of the iceberg, but the quality of the research, the quality of the data, the different types of data that we have available to us that we did not have even 10 years ago, I think is just so substantial and I think can only benefit the young people in the country, which is really the goal of all of this. I do want to follow up with Dr. Phillips to say that we did for the first time include our transgender identity question in the 2023 data collection for YRBS. So that data will be reported when we release the 2023 data starting in August. So, I'm sure that many of you are waiting with bated breath for that data. We are as well, and I think to be able for the first time using the national data to use the full LGBTQ+, I think, is really exciting. I do agree that we do need to start to explore how to add the I. I think that's probably the next frontier for us, but I think as many of you know, surveillance systems like YRBS don't change easily, don't change quickly, and are designed not to change quickly or easily. The CDC actually doesn't determine what goes on in the YRBS survey. So, the standard survey, which is the basis for both the national survey and all of the state and local surveys, is decided on through a balloting process that includes the YRBS coordinators in all of the states and locals who conduct the survey. So, when we want to make a change in that way, we go to the YRBS coordinators and ballot those changes, and those changes get voted on. What that does ‑‑ I think to speak to some of the other issues that have been raised here ‑‑ is that it protects the survey from undue sometimes political but sometimes other types of interference. So, it remains difficult to easily change a question, take questions off, add questions on. And so, it kind of protects the system. On the other hand, it does make it really difficult, as we seem to be a number of steps behind kind of both how young people identify themselves and new and emerging issues that might arise. So that's something that we always battle with. I think that there's real value ‑‑ we're so excited about the data that Trevor Project and other organizations are collecting, because I think what it does is it allows us to go deeper. You know, YRBS and other kinds of national surveys are about an inch deep and a mile wide. We collect so many outcomes and it is meant to kind of provide that for the country, but I think the ability to be able to go down more deeply at the survey level is incredibly useful. And I think one of the things that I would love to see us do, moving forward, is to figure out how to be more collaborative in terms of what ‑‑ from government surveys, what we decide to include on them and then what our partners can include in some of the non‑governmental surveys. I think that would be really helpful to be able to kind of offset each other in important ways. We are so excited to be able ‑‑ and have been since the beginning of the ABCD study, to be able to support the inclusion of sexual and gender questions and so excited to see some of the results as they come out, because I think that that's giving us just a really rich sense of the ‑‑ from very early ages, kind of the progression and the development. And I think Dr. Strang's research as well is telling us more about the kind of developmental processes. One of the things that I think that does is it points to some really important directions that Dr. Meyer raised about are things getting better from a societal standpoint. We know from both YRBS data and from other datasets, like data collected by The Trevor Project, that from a mental and behavioral standpoint, what young people are experiencing is not optimal. We are seeing much too high levels of emotional distress, anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts and behaviors among LGBTQI young people, and that suggests to us that even as we are seeing improvements in some of the policy environment broadly, in our own work, the fact that those of us across such a wide swath of investigators, including government agencies, are able to do this work and to have workshops like these two days suggest that there have been changes, but they don't seem to, as yet, be getting to the point where we're seeing positive changes more broadly in the mental and behavioral outcomes for young people. And I think what I would love to have us discuss are ways in which we can look at the relationship, whether that's kind of looking at individual states that have policies and practices in place that are not supportive of LGBTQ young people or are and being able to track those to differences in the outcomes for young people. I want to get to discussion. I had two slides, one pointing out the disparities in YRBS ‑‑ you all know those well ‑‑ but one other slide that I had that I'm not gonna take the time to pull up is a paper that we wrote ‑‑ thank you. Go to the next one, this one here. This is really where I would love to see us more nationally take a look. So, this is looking at policies and practices that schools have to support LGBTQ young people in districts where we worked. And what we looked at was ‑‑ we have another system called the School Health Profile System that looks at a whole host of school health policies and practices, and we looked at these four specifically; whether a school has a gender sexuality alliance, whether the school identifies safe spaces for LGBTQ young people, whether harassment is prohibited and whether those anti‑harassment policies are enforced, and providing professional development for educators on the importance of inclusivity in schools. And what we did was, we looked at whether or not the school had those policies and practices in place in the YRBS data collected in those schools versus schools that did not have these policies and practices in place, what did we see for the young people. And what we saw was that in the schools that put these policies and practices in place, we saw decreases in depressive symptoms, suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and suicide attempts. We not only saw that for the young people who identified as lesbian, gay or bisexual, we also saw that among the young people who identified as heterosexual. And so, what we saw in this particular study is that not only are policies and practices that support LGBTQ young people beneficial for the young people who are targeted by those policies and practices, but they were good for all of the young people at a population level in schools. And so this is just one small example of when we look at ‑‑ and you can take the slides down, thank you ‑‑ when we look at the relationship between the policies that are put in place and things that either a community or a state, in this case a school, are doing, does it have an impact on the health and well‑being of young people? And I would really love for us to be able to look more closely at the impact of a number of things, as several people have mentioned. When we put anti‑transgender youth policies in place, what impact does it have not only for the young people who identify as transgender but young people more generally? And I think that can tell us a lot about ‑‑ back to the original question ‑‑ is it getting better? So, I would welcome any conversation both about those ideas and any others you might have. I'm happy to now turn it over to see if there's any questions from the audience on any of the presentations that we presented here today. PARISA PARSAFAR: Would any of the panelists want to answer the question before we move to some of the questions from the chat? ALEXI POTTER: I'd actually love to just share a little information. Just fascinating what you found with the school data, and we did an analysis of the anti‑gender law policies across the state within ABCD. So, we had about half the kids in protective states and about half the kids in states with negative state laws, and we found from paralleling your information that higher rates of interpersonal violence, bullying and harassment at school not only for gender‑diverse youth but actually for all youth in the sample. So, a really interesting parallel, and we're actually working with the mass project now to get longitudinal data, so hopefully we can see how that has changed over time. So, thanks for sharing that. KATHLEEN ETHIER: I think it's a really important point in that folks who are arguing for or against some of these policies are kind of taking ‑‑ are picking a side, and what we are seeing in our data and it sounds like what you're seeing as well is that there is no side, that what is good for one group of young people is good for all young people, and that when you put things in place that target one group or are negative, whether that's intentional or not for a particular group of young people, it negatively impacts all young people. And I think that speaks to the interconnected nature of young people, but also what that kind of targeting does for the environment in general. PARISA PARSAFAR: And Dr. Olson‑Kennedy, it looked like you wanted to respond to that question as well. JOHANNA OLSON‑KENNEDY: Yeah, I did want to respond to the question, is it getting better. I think it's yes and no. I think that our understanding and knowledge in some ways ‑‑ well, prior to all the bans coming into effect, access was really becoming much more available, but I think that the pushback on youth care specifically for trans and nonbinary youth has made the work considerably more difficult. And I think just reflecting on our own RO1, multi‑site RO1, just the fact that we have experienced nine FOIA requests and these are things that take time, that we're not funded to do. And I think another thing that's really interesting that people aren't talking about enough is that pediatric hospitals, where a lot of youth care clinics are embedded, are not used to taking on the challenges, political challenges related to their care. I think that other segments of medicine are, but I don't think pediatric hospitals are. And the final thing that I will say is that the gender clinics that do exist in safe states right now are having to absorb people coming from other states, and that's another thing that our capacity just doesn't allow us to do. PARISA PARSAFAR: Thank you. Dr. Meyer? ILAN MEYER: Yeah, I think ‑‑ I've been really troubled by my own findings and the findings we're all sharing in terms of ‑‑ on the one hand, things are getting better. There are no doubt public attitudes are better. Certainly, around sexual orientation there's been a split on transgender issues lately because of some of the attacks on the right that Dr. Olson‑Kennedy mentioned, but the lives of LGBT people are not necessarily getting better, even where things are getting better objectively. And I think we need to begin to think about more microenvironment than the level of policy that we're thinking of, number one. So, we interviewed people in part of my study, and we had a young guy who was born in San Francisco, who was talking about ‑‑ he was like 18 at the time, so 2016, and he was talking about things that are very familiar to me from my growing up, about hiding, about shame, about being shamed by his church. So just imposing policy doesn't honestly penetrate it enough into everyday life of every person. The second part of it is religion. We have to ‑‑ that is, to me, the most difficult area and there are a lot of religious organizations that are very supportive, but there are more religious organizations that make life very miserable for LGBT people. And I don't know if I can still share, but I wanted to share this. This kind of helped me, because I think there was a time where we thought things are just getting better and they're going to continue getting better, and I really like this quote from an interview with ‑‑ I borrowed it from his book apparently, but from the New York Times: "Contrasting the arc of moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice. History is not an arc bending towards justice but a war of dueling forces, racists and anti‑racists, and each escalate their response when the other advances." And I think we all, as interventionists, need to take that in. There was a certain optimism and euphoria at some point that we're all getting better. Obama was elected president and racism is over, marriage equality was ruled, and homophobia is over, and we know better now. I think we should remember that lesson. PARISA PARSAFAR: Thank you. To build from this discussion of is it getting better and the different perspectives, in the chat we received a question of, how can clinicians and others who are working with LGBTQ youth use the research that you've shared today to help better support and incorporate it into their work? So how can we translate the research into practice to help make improvements? DERRICK MATTHEWS: I can speak about that briefly. One of the first things is I think we are able to really assess a lot of the co‑occurring needs and challenges. For example, we're able to rightly identify that housing insecurity was an issue for a lot of young LGBTQ+ folks. So, I think being prepared ahead of time with the ability to refer folks to services that could support ‑‑ housing, as an example, is one thing. And we're also able to see the challenges that a lot of young people face that I think are able to be addressed in kind of clinical encounters. So, for example, we published ‑‑ a lot of young folks really said they couldn't even envision themselves living to 35 and that they didn't have a lot of purpose in their life. So those are things that not only are associated with suicide attempts, but they're also kind of ways we can engage folks in conversation that might be easier for young people to do than to just give a clinical assessment and have a much more like cold interaction that way. So, I think there's a lot of things there. There's also we know a lot about individual and community‑level resiliency that folks find that are really helpful and I think learning from that, those are the things that I think we can kind of use and leverage when we're talking with young folks. PARISA PARSAFAR: Thanks. Dr. Strang? JOHN STRANG: I just wanted to add that whenever we talk about the application of research to clinical practice for LGBTQIA+ people, we have to acknowledge that in this country there's a huge disparity in access to clinicians, that we do not have enough clinical access for patients. Wait lists of one to two years for patients who might be coming in for a gender consultation are pretty normal across the country, and that's in metropolitan areas. So, for families a few hours out, these disparities are great. So, it is a little bit of an idealistic conversation to talk about the application of research to clinical practice when we have such a crisis in the country for our youth. PARISA PARSAFAR: Great points. And Dr. Olson‑Kennedy. JOHANNA OLSON‑KENNEDY: Yes, I can't stress that enough. And I will add that our access to mental health services, all of the things that we know come along with the experiences that we've seen so much of today are also desperately needed, and certainly we know there are service deserts, not just in specific states but even in the rural communities in safer states. Especially for trans youth but for all youth, access to mental health care is in serious jeopardy with an increasing population of young people who have need for that. PARISA PARSAFAR: Other questions in the chat are sort of surrounding the school environment and what we can do to promote more diverse activities in school environments that might be less supportive initially, and also how folks are thinking about these initiatives in schools that are more supportive of LGBTQ youth, how it's having an impact on the school environment more broadly, including the staff and personnel as well. So, if anyone has thoughts about that from their work, or what can be done in schools. KATHLEEN ETHIER: I will say that in our work with schools, we're making great progress and I think we've seen in the last two years or so a change in the arc of progress for LGBTQ youth. I'm hoping that will start to change again. I mean, I think when young people in the entire country are experiencing a mental health crisis and we start to be able to call attention to the fact that in the places where we are putting laws and policies and school‑based practices in place that are actually harmful for the full range of young people, then that school will start to see kind of a backing off of some of those anti‑LGBTQ policies and practices. That is my hope. We actually know very clearly from ‑‑ the slide kind of gives us a couple of them. We know pretty clearly what schools that can do is helpful and supportive and works. So those are things like having places for young people to gather where they can share identities, having safe adults easily accessible and identifiable, making sure that we are not ‑‑ that everyone knows that bullying and harassment is not allowed, and making sure we provide information to all of the people who look at schools and who work in schools as to why this is important. I mean, those are four kinds of really broad categories of things that are really effective. When we do those things, I think we also see improvements in the health and well‑being of the LGBTQ staff who work in a school, and I think that ‑‑ we haven't studied that in as much depth, but we have heard that in the places where laws and policies have changed and teachers and school staff feel discriminated against or feel that there's stigma added or, in some cases, have lost their jobs because they have been out at work, making sure that we support not just the kids but also the adults in any system is really important. PARISA PARSAFAR: Thank you so much. More questions more broadly in terms of the original question you posed. In terms of whether or not things are getting better, do you think that there's shifting expectations of what constitutes well‑being in general? For example, younger LGBTQ+ individuals might have higher expectations for understanding well‑being and how they should be treated, but these standards aren't necessarily being met yet. KATHLEEN ETHIER: I think that's a great point. I would love to hear what some of the other panelists might glean from the work they're doing. ILAN MEYER: I think that is kind of turning around the problem to the young kids in some ways, like saying they have expectations, but I think we see from the data that it's not just about expectations, it's about very serious objective measures of health and well‑being that are not met by the education system. You mentioned YRBS ‑‑ to me, that is kind of like a thermometer. I always go when you publish results to look at the suicide data on LGBT youth, and every time so far, I've been terribly disappointed. So, I think until we change those things, we can't really think that they are an expectation problem or expectation gap, but more of a delivery gap in terms of what they're receiving. PARISA PARSAFAR: Any other thoughts? Yeah, go ahead. JOHANNA OLSON‑KENNEDY: I think we can't underestimate the value of social media in this regard. I do think that young people absolutely connect around understanding and supporting other LGBTQ youth, and I think that's really exciting. And also, the algorithms, we always talk about them being bad, but I think they can be really valuable for young people looking for community but also around expectation‑setting, certainly around access to care, but also just equity in general. I just want to pop back to the school thing for a minute, which is if we continue to erase the progress that we've made in school, for example, like certain books and things that expose young people to all kinds of trajectories of human development, that's really problematic not just for LGBTQ+ youth but for all youth. And I think there's going to be ‑‑ what worries me is there's this rip where there's going to be a much bigger disparity in, ironically, the states that already were struggling to incorporate this. And I really appreciate ‑‑ I wish I could remember her name ‑‑ that said all of ‑‑ anti‑racism and a broadening of people's minds, it needs to be built in and not tacked on. So, teachers in school systems can embed all of these things into the way that they teach. I think that's really important. PARISA PARSAFAR: Thank you so much for highlighting both the challenges that we still have to address as researchers and clinicians and those that are engaging with the youth as a society more broadly but also some of the structures and initiatives, we already have in place that can be expanded and built out to help support them. Thank you all for being here with us today. These were wonderful presentations and discussion. We have a break now until 1:30, and then the fun will continue. So, thank you, everyone, and have a great break. [ Break.] CRYSTAL BARKSDALE: Shall we start? Okay. I think we're at 1:31, so I think we will go ahead and get started. Good afternoon again, everyone. My name is Crystal Barksdale, and I want to welcome you back to our conference. I am a program director at the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, and I'm going to be your moderator for our next session entitled Social and Structural Determinants of Health: Community, Culture and Policies. This session is going to highlight the translational and multilevel research on those community, social and structural‑level social determinants of health that are important and impact mental health outcomes among our sexual and gender minority youth. Today, this afternoon, we have featured several speakers which I'm excited about, and I hope you are too. First, we will hear from Dr. Skyler Jackson from Yale School of Public Health who will be talking with us about multilevel stigma and depression among Black and Latino LGBTQ+ adolescents. Then we will hear from Dr. Roberto Abreu from the Department of Psychology, University of Florida, who will talk with us about the importance of cultural values and traditions for LatinX LGBTQ youth, their families and communities. Next, we'll hear from Dr. Jane Hereth from University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, who will discuss the mental health needs of LGBTQ+ youth involved in the juvenile justice system. And then we will hear from Dr. Dana Prince from Case Western University who will discuss the research and practice gaps and opportunities related to SGM youth involved in various public systems. Then we will hear from Dr. Kerith Conron from Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law who will discuss with us how state policies and school environments may converge to either reduce or exacerbate mental health inequities among LGBTQ youth. And then we'll hear, lastly, but not least, from Dr. Meg Paceley and Spencer Evans, both from University of Connecticut School of Social Work, who will talk about the impact of anti‑trans policies on the mental health of gender‑diverse youth. Our discussant, Brian Altman, who is the director of the National Mental Health and Substance Use Policy Laboratory at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA, will then provide some comments and lead us in a discussion of this panel. So, I turn the virtual floor over to Dr. Jackson to lead us off. Thank you. Dr. Jackson. SKYLER JACKSON: Hello, you all. Great to be here today. I'm going to go ahead and share my slides and make sure what you all are seeing. Oh, that's not what I want. Let's see. Let's try this again. There we go. So, it's my pleasure to kick off this discussion and this series of talks on this topic. As was mentioned earlier, I'm going to be talking about a study where we attempted to look at stigma across multiple levels and also in various types or domains to understand depression among Black and LatinX LGBTQ adolescents. So, let's go ahead and dive in. So as many of you are likely acutely aware, there's some major mental health disparities among LGBTQ people as compared to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts. This is one of the most persistent and enduring mental health disparities in psychiatric epidemiology. And unfortunately, what we know is that adolescents are not immune to these sorts of mental health disparities. In fact, by virtue of their dependent legal status and being in a sensitive developmental period, they may be disproportionately at risk of some of the health‑eroding forms of stigma known to drive these disparities. In fact, that idea that stigma is the real culprit that drives these disparities is something that we take to be true now but has not always been the case. If we dial back 50 years, we know that the disparities that we see in mental health between LGBTQ folks, adult and youth, versus their heterosexual cisgender counterparts were mostly explained through pseudoscience, through myths, that somehow being a sexual or gender, quote, unquote, deviant somehow made you, in and of yourself, pathological, and that that made you more prone to psychopathology. Today, fortunately, we have science that gives us a better understanding of how stigma actually leads to downstream problems in health, and that allows us to put the blame where it really lies with an environment and context of stigma. So today we know that social stigma that LGBTQ people face is something that both drives and maintains mental health disparities as faced by LGBTQ youth as compared to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts. We have an accumulating body of literature that shows these effects pretty robustly across time and across subgroups. However, there are a couple of areas of gaps in the literature that we still need to advance the literature on. And I want to talk about two. First is that we have uneven attention to how stigma manifests to drive mental health disparities across multiple levels. So, what I mean by that is that, fortunately, we have a really robust body of that literature that looks at interpersonal everyday experiences of bias, discrimination, bullying, cyberbullying that LGBTQ adolescents might face. We have also a pretty big, although slightly smaller, body of literature that looks at how the negative anti‑LGBTQ sentiments that exist in one's world can get internalized, leading towards internalized homophobia or biphobia or transphobia. So that literature base we have as well. But the smallest of the levels, data sources and empirical basis is that for structural level stigma. We have very little research, comparatively, that looks at how structural‑level factors actually get under the skin to cause downstream problems with mental health, particularly for LGBTQ adolescents. This is something many of us are thinking more about these days because we know that we are in unprecedented times when LGBTQ individuals' dignity and rights are being debated and legislated at the state and federal levels on an ongoing basis. As you can see, even as of just last week, the ACLU is tracking over 500 anti‑LGBTQ bills in the U.S. But it's really important to remember that when I'm talking about structural‑level factors, unjust laws are only one part of the broader picture. So, in addition to that, we have to think about things like anti‑LGBTQ discriminatory policies. This can occur in one's school, at one's place of work, within the healthcare setting, et cetera. We also want to be thinking about the broader fabric of oppressive social norms. So, this can be at the community, state, or even societal level where we see that norms that embody an anti‑LGBTQ stance can actually represent something more structural as opposed to thinking about them only as individual factors. And, lastly, we want to be thinking about unequal access to resources, particularly resources, whether they're in terms of people, people‑based resources, but also things like access to spaces that affirm one's identity. We can think, for example, in terms of the availability of safe and affirming bathrooms for trans‑identified individuals. All right. So, with those gaps in mind ‑‑ with that gap in mind, I want to talk about a second one, which is that we have inadequate attention to stigma and its multiple forms. So, we know that LGBTQ adolescents, because they are sexual minorities and/or gender minorities, are at risk for at least one or two forms of stigma, but that doesn't make them immune to potentially facing other forms of discrimination, bias, and stigma. For example, the populations I'm focusing on today, Black and/or LatinX LGBTQ adolescents, are at high risk for facing things like racism and xenophobia in addition to anti‑LGBTQ sentiments. We have intersectionality, which comes from Black feminist activism and has been discussed in the academy within legal studies in critical race theory, and it aims to understand people's individual risks and resiliencies as they navigate multiple systems of power. Scholars of intersectionality argue that one's experience of oppression is really greater than the sum of their parts, and that if we want to understand that interlocking nature and study it, that it's best to do so in a way that studies them simultaneously in an integrated manner. This is something that we see increasingly but still relatively rarely as most minority health disparity research focuses on one aspect of minority status and isolation from others. That said, we do have research that's looking at how anti‑LGBTQ stigma and racial/ethnic stigma might land in the lives of LGBTQ people of color and, in particular, how it affects depression. So, at the interpersonal level, there's a lot of research ‑‑ I'm just giving a couple of examples ‑‑ that show that both anti‑LGBTQ stigma and racial ethnic stigma are associated with depression and, in fact, research showing that they may have a multiplicative effect on depressive symptoms among sexual minority adolescents of color. Although much smaller, there's some research at the structural level. I'll give one quick example of a study by English, et al., in 2022 that showed that when looking at depression, anti‑LGBTQ structural stigma and racial ethnic structural stigma are both associated with depression among Black sexual minority adolescent males but not among White sexual minority adolescent males, telling us that there's something intersectional in how these forces of oppression might land in the lives of these individuals based on their racial positionality. All right. So, considering those gaps, I want to talk about a research study briefly where we tried to address some of these challenges. So, the present study wanted to look at various forms of stigma. And there's sort of two ways we varied the way we looked at it. So across multiple domains, so including race/ethnicity but also sexual orientation and gender identity, but also different levels, so looking not just at interpersonal everyday experiences of stigma and bias but also structural‑level factors and to look at how those different forms of stigma, together and separately, might be associated with depression among a highly stigmatized population, Black and LatinX LGBTQ adolescents. In order to facilitate this, and as something to share with science, we wanted to develop and test the new composite index of state‑level adolescent‑focused LGBTQ structural stigma to look at how that relates to depression as well. The data source for this study is the national LGBTQ+ adolescent teen survey. It was conducted in collaboration with the Human Rights Campaign, The Trevor Project, and Planned Parenthood. There were over 2500 young people in the study, ages 13 to 17. They all lived in the U.S. but across various states. This is a snapshot of their gender identity, sexual orientation, and race and ethnicity, but please know that these statistics are not ‑‑ these counts are not mutually exclusive, meaning somebody could have identified as both Black and LatinX in the present study. Our outcome of interest is recent depressive symptoms, and that was measured using 10 items from the Kutcher Adolescent Depression Scale. So, the first series of results I want to share are just some basic things that corroborate things that we already see pretty robustly in literature, and that is that different domains of stigma, in this case racial/ethnic bullying, was how we looked at interpersonal stigma, and also sexual‑orientation‑based bullying, how these two forms of bullying might jointly or independently and uniquely predict depression. So, in this study, as expected, we did find that both those who endorse racial/ethnic bullying and those who endorsed sexual orientation bullying, that those were both associated with greater odds of recent depression. We looked at these things to see if these had effects above and beyond one another. So even after controlling sexual orientation bullying, racial ethnic bullying still predicts recent depressive symptoms. And the same is true for sexual orientation bullying, that even after controlling racial/ethnic bullying, we see a unique association in terms of greater odds of recent depression. The last thing we looked at was some interactions. I won't go through every result, but we'll talk about the most interesting one because it sorts of grapples with some intersectionality; and that is that as compared to those that endorsed neither racial/ethnic or sexual orientation bullying, those that endorsed both forms, we saw nearly 2.5 times greater odds of recent depression. So, keep those in mind. We're going to come back to some of these variables in a moment. The next thing we wanted to look was this development of an adolescent‑focused structural stigma index for LGBTQ issues. We looked in every state, and we looked at domains where we could find pretty broad state‑level data across the country in almost every state. And we looked at seven different areas that we considered to be possibly protective for LGBTQ adolescents and two that we would think would be harmful, such as the presence of "Don't Say Gay" legislation or really negative implicit attitudes measured through the implicit association test averages in that state. As you can see, we looked at various domains, again, in every state to see whether they had anti‑bullying legislation, whether they had state conversion therapy bans, and we tried to have some diversity, although this is heavy in laws and legislation, to even look at things like social attitudes and sort of access to people‑based resources as well. So, on a state‑by‑state basis, we found pretty pronounced support that, for example, youth living in states with more LGBTQ+ public officials or with a greater density of GSAs or with anti‑bullying legislation, so on and so forth, almost across the board had lower rates of recent depression. And the opposite was true with the harmful effects. I will say that the "Don't Say Gay" legislation row you see is non‑significant. That trend was in the expected direction, meaning the youth in those states did report worse depressive symptoms, but it was not significant, and that is because this data was actually collected at a time when "Don't Say Gay" legislation was actually relatively rare and new. That comes from data collected in 2015, and we needed to use data that old because we wanted to ‑‑ the data collected from the adolescents in the study was in 2017. So next up, and in some ways more excitingly, we used these various areas of protectiveness and harmfulness to create a composite index. And what that means is that for ‑‑ in a given state, for every protective factor that they had, we gave them a negative 1 and for every harmful factor they had they got a plus 1. If you do that math, that means every state got a number between 2 and negative 7, and this represents how the states with the most anti‑LGBTQ structural stigma got a 2 all the way down to those with the least anti‑LGBTQ structural stigma got a negative 7. This is the map that came from it. Again, I want to note that this map is already outdated because there's been so much movement, the most glaring of which to many of you all might be Florida, which I imagine, based on changes in legislation over the past six to seven years, might be red, but on here at this time, based on the indicators we used, was actually more towards the middle. And we did find a dose‑dependent relationship between youth living in the states with the highest structural stigma versus the least. I'll give you just one statistic, which is compared to the Black and LatinX adolescents who lived in the states with the least structural stigma, those who lived in the states with the most structural stigma had 32% greater odds of recent depression. CRYSTAL BARKSDALE: Dr. Jackson, I'm so sorry. You just have a few more minutes. Just one more minute. SKYLER JACKSON: This is my last statistic, so right on time. CRYSTAL BARKSDALE: Thank you. SKYLER JACKSON: Of course. Thanks for the time check. So, the last thing I want to share is that our last thing was to look at whether anti‑LGBTQ structural stigma still predicted depressive episodes, depressive symptoms, above and beyond racial/ethnic and sexual orientation bullying, and indeed we found that it did. So, you can read more about this in the published study that came out in 2023. I'm not going to go over this, but these are things you might look for are some of the ways that structural stigma actually might be predicting depression among these young people. And we also talk about some key limitations, for example, the lack of a structural stigma index for racism in the study, as well as opportunities for intervention. I want to thank folks who were involved, from coauthors to folks that contributed to the data collection and many funding sources, including NIMH. And that's all I've got. So, I'll stop sharing my screen here, and I look forward to hearing from the rest of the presenters. Thanks for your time. ROBERTO ABREU: All right. I think I'm on next. I'm going to go ahead and share my slides. All right. Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for being here. Thank you, Dr. Jackson, for the wonderful presentation. I look forward to the rest of our time together. Once again, my name is Roberto Abreu. Pronouns are he/him and el. I am at the University of Florida Psychology Department, and I'm the PI of the Collective Healing and Empowering Voices Through Research and Engagement, or the Chevere Lab, and I'm excited to talk to you today about LatinX LGBTQ youth and their families and communities. And specifically, what I want to focus on is patterns and things that I have observed throughout the years in my research with LatinX LGBTQ individuals and their families and the importance of cultural values and traditions and the importance of not seeing all LGBTQ folks as one big group and really taking into consideration those cultural pieces. Again, I will just touch briefly about some of the research that I do and then focus mostly on those LatinX cultural pieces, my research with LatinX LGBTQ youth and their families. I'll talk a little bit about implications for next steps and ‑‑ yeah ‑‑ and I think that will be our time. All righties. So, broadly speaking, my research looks at ‑‑ I'm really interested in looking at how LGBTQ people and specifically LGBTQ youth and their families and communities interact with each other. Right. So, what that really means is that I look at LatinX LGBTQ youth and their families' mental health outcomes not just for the LGBTQ person but also for their parents, families, and what is most important, the role of culture in these relationships, in these interactions. I also look at trans youth and their parents and, more broadly, the interaction between LGBTQ individuals across lifespan within their communities. Because we only have a short time today, I want to focus today specifically on LatinX LGBTQ youth and their families. All right. So, before we even get there, right ‑‑ so what do we know about research about the experiences of LGBTQ youth and their parents, right? So, generally speaking, when a parent accepts and supports their child, right, we see positive outcomes on the LGBTQ person; for example, higher positive identity development, higher self‑esteem, better mental health outcomes. Right. And the opposite is also true. When LGBTQ youth report more rejection or less acceptance, we see higher substance use, sexual risk‑taking behaviors, internalized stigma. Now, something to note from this research is that it generally looks at the experiences of LGBTQ individuals themselves or that of their parents and family members. Very few research actually looks at the (inaudible) experiences. Also, most research really looks at the experiences of LGBTQ individuals and their White mothers. Right. So, we know a lot about how is it that LGBTQ folks are interacting with their mothers, specifically White mothers. Right? We know very little about fathers. So, we know very little ‑‑ we know less about the experience of LGBTQ individuals of color and their parents and family members. So, another way to look at this is minority stress has a direct relationship with mental health outcomes for both LGBTQ youth and their parents and family members. Right? Family relations both, one, have a direct relationship to mental health outcomes, such as rejection of one's LGBTQ child, and two, it also serves as a buffer in the well‑being of LGBTQ youth. Right. Again, another limitation of this research is that it assumes that all LGBTQ youth are having the same experience regardless of race, ethnicity, culture, background overall. Well, certainly there are studies that compare the experiences of White versus BIPOC LGBTQ youth in the context of their experiences of being accepted or rejected by their parents and family members. Most of the time ‑‑ and it's not done intentionally, but a lot of times it promotes a more racist narrative. What I mean by "racist narrative" ‑‑ what I mean by this is that most of the studies often kind of compare LGBTQ youth of color to their White counterparts. It often concludes that LGBTQ people of color have less support, right? And a lot of conclusions are made as to why that is the case. Right. And it really leaves this big void, right, for researchers to fill, and many of these conclusions fail to capture culture, right, traditions, histories that is cultural, that different cultural groups have. So, I think this narrative ‑‑ so this narrative could be particularly harmful because it often implies that communities of color are both more homophobic, more transphobic, more biphobic and otherwise more exclusionary of their LGBTQ members. Now, I think we can all agree the systems of oppression that affect LGBTQ youth are not exclusive to a particular group, including communities of color. Right? But when we use the only lens to interpret parent‑child relationships, we create this universal kind of narrative about what is happening in this relationship between LGBTQ youth and their parents and family members, right, that really presents White communities and White parents are safer than parents and communities of color to LGBTQ folks. Right. And that's kind of where my work comes in, the work that I've been doing the last few years, specifically with LatinX families and LatinX individuals. Right? I've been trying to understand what cultural values and beliefs and traditions are at play here, right, in the absence of their White counterparts. I really want to understand, right, what is happening, how the parents and family members are thinking about their interaction with their LGBTQ youth member, right, what the LGBTQ youth are telling us are happening within their community with their parents. So certainly, some of the studies that we have done with LatinX LGBTQ youth, right, with microagressions and the effect of microaggression on depression, sexual harassment and depression, and the role that parents have. What we've learned is that, yep, parents' acceptance actually serves as a very strong buffer in these relationships. Right? We've also conducted qualitative studies. All this work has been qualitative and also quantitative. We've also conducted qualitative studies and asked, like, so what specifically culturally is happening in these relationships? Right. So, we've learned a ton about specifically what is happening with LatinX LGBTQ folks but also with their parents and families from a cultural lens, right, in trying to understand what is happening in this relationship. But we've also conducted other studies with LatinX parents and family members and asked them about their relationship with their child. Right? We've talked to fathers of trans youth. We have talked to fathers of sexual minority folks. But even when we do studies, they're not ‑‑ we do not necessarily ask about relationship with parents and family members. Right? For example, we've done a series of studies with trans LatinX folks and asked them about their other experiences with healthcare providers, their experiences seeking jobs, their experiences just within their communities. These cultural pieces and how they relate to the relationship with their parents, with family members, are often very salient. So, what we have been able to see in our research is that how is it that this ‑‑ the LatinX cultural values, beliefs and traditions are at the core of this family community experience when it comes to LGBTQ folks and their communities and their families. Right? And, therefore, we really ‑‑ I really posed the call that, you know, that research questions, analysis and findings must be conceptualized from, at the very least, keeping in mind very specific cultural pieces in order to truly understand what is happening in this relationship. Some of this, what I'm going to present to you, is kind of like themes that we have seen throughout the years of how is it that the different cultural pieces, the LatinX cultural pieces, are at play here. So, some of those are family and community support, although there are some studies that have specifically looked at family support, for example. What we have learned specifically through our qualitative work is that it is more nuanced than just family support. Right? Gender norms are also extremely important, some marianismo, or the role of Latino women within the culture, or machismo, or more like hypermasculine type of interactions, a more aggressive type of behavior, right? Or caballerismo. I will go into more detail in the next few slides. And religion and spirituality, right? So, these have been kind of like core cultural pieces that have shown up in our work. So, when it comes to family and community, what we have seen is that it's a lot more nuanced. Right? So often LGBTQ youth, but also their family members, talk about receiving support from family members during the process of accepting their child. Right? They often talk about navigating family dynamics, so balancing family members' different reactions to LGBTQ people and issues, right? Maintaining harmony in the family unit is a big one that often shows up in our work and seeking support from other LatinX family members specifically. So, when it comes to gender norms, referring to machismo, so coping and reframing within the cultural context in order to accept family members, caballerismo, emphasis on Latino, sense of loyalty, family and emotional connections. Right? Marianismo, emphasis on the roles of Latina women within the culture to help these family’s kind of understand and accept their LGBTQ child better. Respeto. It's more than just respect. It's more kind of like this cultural piece of how to interact with elders but also this aspect of, like, people deserving dignity often shows up in our work as well. And religion and spirituality, either embracing religion and spirituality, rejecting ‑‑ it is oftentimes reframing religious messages ‑‑ often shows up, and it often shows up throughout all of our work. And I just kind of, like, went through them really quickly. So, some main takeaways are parental acceptance and family acceptance of LGBTQ is not universal. And specifically, when working with LatinX LGBTQ folks, I think cultural values, traditions and ‑‑ they play a significant role in this relationship, and the interventions must be culturally specific to this community, taking into consideration these cultural pieces in order to actually see outcomes. So ‑‑ and this is kind of the first slide ‑‑ one of the first slides I showed you. I guess one of my biggest takeaways is, like, we cannot understand really what is happening here if we do not understand the cultural pieces. And I will take it a step further and say that further research, really what we need to spend time looking is not just at the cultural values and traditions but how is it that those are interacting specifically within specific systems of oppression as well. And here's a shout‑out or ‑‑ to collaborators with whom I do this work throughout the United States, Dr. Aldo Barrita, Russell Toomey, Drs. Gattamorta, Gonzalez and Perez‑Brena. And I think this takes me to my time. I look forward to questions and answers. JANE HERETH: Hi, everyone. I hope you can hear me, okay. Just bear with me for a moment. Okay. And hopefully you can all see those slides. So, thank you all for attending and taking the time to be here today. Thanks also to the organizers of this event, and happy Pride Month to everyone. My name is Jane Hereth, I use she or they pronouns, and I'm an assistant professor of social work at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee. Today I'm going to be talking about mental health needs of LGBTQ+ youth involved in the criminal legal system. I'm going to begin by sharing some data regarding the overrepresentation of LGBTQ+ youth in the criminal legal system and mental health impacts of system involvement, then I'll share some of my own research regarding pathways by which youth enter the system, and finally I'll identify some points along those pathways where we could better intervene to prevent further involvement and to support mental health. So, estimates indicate that roughly 7 to 9% of youth in the U.S. identify as LGBTQ+, yet research indicates that about 20% of youth within juvenile facilities identify as LGBTQ+. And 85% of LGBTQ+ and gender nonconforming youth within the juvenile justice system are youth of color, indicating the increased vulnerability to criminal legal system involvement experienced by LGBTQ+ youth of color. Once inside the system, youth experience a range of adverse outcomes and traumatic experiences. Youth experience discrimination and bias in many forms all along the pathway leading up to criminal legal system involvement. It shapes how they are interacting with and treated by the police, lawyers, judges, facility staff and other youth, resulting in increased surveillance, harsher sentences and punishments, and worse treatment; and then that, in turn, shapes the rest of the experiences listed here. So, for example, youth are often housed according to sex assigned at birth within juvenile justice facilities, so transgender and nonbinary youth are not able to express or have their identities affirmed. They're often hyper‑visible and outed, sometimes placed into segregated or isolated housing, often for the stated purpose of protecting them, but we know that that also has adverse mental health outcomes. Youth are routinely denied access to LGBTQ+ affirming medical and mental health care, including gender‑affirming care, and LGBTQ+ youth are at increased risk of experiencing victimization by other youth and by staff. So, for example, data from the national survey of youth in custody found that 10.3% of youth who identify as non‑heterosexual reported being sexually victimized compared to 1.5% of heterosexual youth in custody. And directly related to all these forms of trauma and discrimination and compounded by trauma and discrimination experienced before even entering the criminal legal system, LGBTQ+ youth report a range of adverse mental health outcomes, including high rates of suicidal ideation and attempts, self‑harm, depression, anxiety, and PTSD. So, I want to turn now to examining a few of the pathways by which youth come into contact with the criminal legal system in the first place in order to contextualize this overrepresentation and the adverse experiences of youth inside but also to highlight some opportunities for prevention and intervention. So, I'll just talk about three pathways from my own research today: The criminalization of LGBTQ+ identities, the school‑to‑prison pipeline, and a pathway that begins often with family rejection and then leads to homelessness and poverty, followed by forms of criminalized survival. These are by no means the only pathways into the system. For each pathway I'll share some quotes from participants in my own research studies. These quotes are from life history interviews I conducted with young transgender women in their late teens, twenties, and early thirties. I interviewed 21 women in Chicago with and without a history of arrest about their pathways into or away from the criminal legal system, their perceptions about the police and other key life events and moments. And while these data are from interviews with transgender women, many of these themes apply broadly to LGBTQ+ youth. So, the first pathway I want to highlight is the historic and current criminalization of LGBTQ+ identities and the crisis of mass incarceration. So, bias and stigma against LGBTQ+ individuals contribute to perceptions of LGBTQ+ individuals as deviant. The intersection of white supremacy and hetero‑cis patriarchy leaves LGBTQ+ people of color particularly vulnerable to perceptions about deviance and criminality. These perceptions have been then codified into laws targeting LGBTQ+ communities. So many of the other panelists have already discussed and noted that we are witnessing an exponential increase in laws targeting LGBTQ+ identities. This is continuing a long historical legacy of laws criminalizing aspects of LGBTQ+ identity. So, some of these current laws, as I'm sure you all know, as we've already discussed today, include laws banning schools from including content on LGBTQ+ identities, making it difficult or even criminal for youth to access gender‑affirming care or for their parents to help them to do so, drag bans, bathroom bills and just so many other current bills. So, the perception of LGBTQ+ individuals as deviant also shapes how law enforcement officials then interact with LGBTQ+ individuals and often contributes to increased surveillance, contact, arrest, and then further and ongoing involvement in the system. So, for example, a participant in my study, Cinnamon, a 20‑year‑old Black woman, stated that she'd been arrested at least 10 times, beginning as a teenager, but she thought that most of those arrests were unjustified and were a result of police harassment and discrimination due to her transgender identity. As a side note, all of the names that are shared here are pseudonyms selected by participants, and identities are how participants describe themselves in their own words. So, Cinnamon stated, "Most of the time they were arresting me it wasn't justified. And most of the time they were harassing me. Like I go to court, and the case is thrown out because they don't have evidence or because the police don't come. Most of the time I get arrested because they're either harassing me or just because I'm trans. I could be walking outside to the school, I could be going to the store, or I could be doing things and just like, hey, what are you doing, or, hey, let me run your name. Police here are terrible, terrible, terrible." So, Cinnamon's experience of being targeted by police because of her identity or walking while trans illustrates the impact of policies and practices that permit police to stop and question individuals when they are suspected of being engaged in criminalized behavior. And as you can expect, this negatively impacts how transgender women and LGBTQ+ youth broadly feel about the police. It's also dehumanizing and negatively impacts mental health. So Aerial, a 22‑year‑old African‑American woman, described how her interactions with the police made her feel less than human, stating, "It's just like being trans and dealing with cops and lawyers and things, especially the police. I don't think they really care about us. I don't think the police think we're human, or we don't have hearts." These perceptions about the police also negatively impact help‑seeking, which then further perpetuates experiences of violence and trauma. So given these negative experiences with police, it's unsurprising that many participants in my research expressed cynicism about the criminal legal system and its ability to help to protect them from victimization. During the time period in which I was conducting interviews, two young Black transgender women were murdered in Chicago, and a number of participants talked about this in interviews. They talked about feeling like the police were not doing enough to investigate the murders of trans women. Discussing the murder of one of her friends, Sasha stated, "I just hope the police and the detectives don't sweep her murder under a rug like any other trans murders: Well, she probably tricked a guy, or, well, she was probably deviant, she was probably doing her prostitution. No, you won't know until you investigate her murder. Most police officers here in Chicago, they're not going to spend too much time investigating a trans murder because they're just going to assume they know what happened." So as Sasha was discussing here, transgender women, particularly transgender women of color, experience disproportionately high rates of violence and murder. And as Sasha suggests, police cynicism is a direct result of transgender women's experiences of victimization by the police and their experiences of the police failing to respond to the murders of transgender women. The feelings of helplessness then compound experiences of vicarious trauma and trauma also caused by direct experiences of victimization. The second pathway I want to highlight is the school‑to‑prison pipeline, which is a term that's used to describe the direct and indirect impact of policies that push students out of schools into the criminal legal system. So, while schools have implemented a range of policies in the name of keeping students safe such as zero‑tolerance policies or having police in schools, we know from the growing body of research that many of these contribute to disproportionate rates of detention, suspension, and expulsion among minoritized students, particularly LGBTQ+ students of color. So, before she stopped going to school, and even before she became involved in the child welfare system, Angela had an altercation with police officers stationed in her school that led to her arrest when she was 17. She and a friend would often sneak out of school. She stated, "We would have a book bag with our girl clothes in it. We would go to the front door and leave out the back door and actually come up north to boy’s town and just walk around and be us. Towards the time that school was supposed to be out, we would hurry up and dress back in our uniforms and go back." So, one day police officers stationed at her school caught her as she was trying to sneak out. They were looking through her bag, saw her girl clothes. They were asking her about it loudly. She felt embarrassed and panicked. She tried to leave. The officers tried to stop her. She stated, "I don't remember exactly what happened, but I think I had two charges of battery to a police officer for that. I didn't even hit them. Resisting arrest maybe." So this led to not wanting to go to school, which led to conflicts with parents, involvement in the child welfare system, running away from a residential program and then, ultimately, homelessness. So, I just wanted to finally talk about a pathway that often ends in LGBTQ+ youth engaging in forms of criminalized survival like theft, panhandling, sex work in order to survive. Reliance on criminalized survival is part of a complex web of family rejection, homelessness, unemployment, poverty, bias, discrimination, heightened police surveillance; more complicated and nuanced than I have time to really delve into today. But I just want to illustrate one story that sort of includes some of the components of this pathway from Mya. So, she described being unhoused at 16 after being kicked out by her mother when she came out as trans. At 21 she met a group of young women who asked if she wanted to commit robbery. Describing her thought process, she stated, "Well, I don't know. I'm not particularly sure about that. But I'm thinking to myself, okay, I don't know where else to go. I don't have any money. I don't know where my next meal is going to come from. I don't even have a toothbrush. I have nothing to take care of my body. It sounded like a good idea. I end up getting arrested." She went on to serve several years in a men's facility, experiencing violence, lack of access to hormones, but since her release she'd gone back to school and was planning to move out of Chicago with her partner to start a family. And I just wanted to note that to highlight that despite many adverse experiences, LGBTQ+ youth are incredibly resilient; but we know, of course, that these experiences take a toll. And while youth can overcome many of these things, they just shouldn't have to. So lastly, to close, as I'm out of time already, I just wanted to highlight some points along these pathways where we could intervene to prevent LGBTQ+ youth from becoming involved in the system in the first place. So, of course, increasing LGBTQ+ affirmative practice and services in all contexts: mental health services, antiviolence services, schools, resources for families, increasing family support, the child welfare system. We already have existing models for LGBTQ+‑affirming clinical services and should be ensuring that these are implemented everywhere that youth are coming into contact. We need to hold the criminal legal system accountable for bias and victimization. And then going back to that first pathway, I think it's critically important, as we've discussed already, that we all do whatever we can to resist anti‑LGBTQ+ policies, whether that be in our local school districts, in our communities, in our states, and nationwide. And, of course, we can do that in our professional roles as experts in youth health and wellness, and we can also do it in our other roles as voters, for those of us who have that privilege, community members, parents, family members, et cetera. So, I'll leave it there and pass it off to Dr. Dana Prince. Thank you all again so much. DANA PRINCE: Hey, hi, everyone. My name is Dana Prince. I use her/her pronouns. I am a White disabled neurodivergent queer fem. I have been out since 1995, working on behalf of my community, and I'm here today to talk more about systems involvement and gaps and opportunities, so this talk flows very nicely from the last one. To begin, though, I would like to knowledge the ancestral, traditional, and contemporary lands of the Lenape, Shawnee, Wyandot Miami, Ottawa, Potawatomi, and other Great Lakes tribes. This is the land upon which I do my research and work in collaboration with community. I'd also like to recognize the myriads of partners who have collaborated with me, co‑conspired with me, and also funded my research here in Cuyahoga County and Cleveland greater area for the last eight years. So as others have already laid out before us, we know that sexual and gender minority youth are at heightened risk for a range of negative mental health outcomes. I am focusing today specifically on suicide, self‑injurious thoughts and behaviors. And many folks on this virtual convening probably already know that suicide is the second leading cause of death for all adolescents and young adults and also that our kids, our sexual gender minority youth, are at increased risk across the lifetime of ideation and attempt, and substantial research has already identified some of the key risk factors for suicidality among sexual gender minority youth, and those have been discussed previously as well. Caregiver and family rejection, abuse and neglect, typically from biological family or kinship networks because of one's sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, peer bullying and victimization, and then also the internalization of queer/homo/transphobia. My work is at the nexus of systems. In terms of the child welfare system, we know that youth with diverse SOGIE ‑‑ that's Sexual Orientation Gender Identity Expression ‑‑ are disproportionately more likely than heterosexual and cisgender peers to experience a variety of negative outcomes, including health challenges, more likely to enter the child welfare system, typically have more placements within an episode of care and more episodes of care ‑‑ that means more times having been removed from home ‑‑ and then placements within that care could be as up to ‑‑ I've worked with youth who have 25 different placements within a two‑year episode of care, for example. They also are more likely to experience adverse outcomes exiting care and have lower reunification rates with their families of origin. Many of our speakers have spoken to this today, but I'm going to go over it again. In terms of child welfare and juvenile court involvement, if we're just looking at youth involved in systems, okay, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, if you are or have been involved in foster care or juvenile court, there's ‑‑ a quarter of these young people report lifetime ideation, 25%. That's double that of non‑involved peers. Youth involved in systems, again, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity or expression are at three times greater risk for suicide ideation, for planning, attempt, and also for completion. One study using population data in California compared young people with a history of child welfare involvement to those without and found that youth with a foster care history were five times more likely to die from suicide compared to youth with no foster care history. We've had speakers today talk about the importance of culture and also intersectional stigma. There's been an alarming trend over the past two decades, a linear trend, of an increase in suicide attempts among Black boys, and the fastest increase among suicide behaviors is among Black girls compared to any other racial or ethnic group. And, finally, we know that our sexual gender minority youth are also at disproportionate risk for ideation and planning, attempt, et cetera. So, some research has looked at this intersection of being LGBTQ and being involved in child welfare or juvenile court, like our last presenter and our next presenter as well. And county‑based estimates typically, which started in L.A. County, we replicated that in Cuyahoga and some others, some national data, have found between 16 to 32% of youth within public child welfare or within a juvenile justice, juvenile court system, are identifying as a sexual gender minority, and that's too compared to 2.8% in the general adolescent population. We've also had a few studies look at different kinds of mental health types of issues and found, for example, that depression and self‑injurious thoughts and behaviors, also hospitalizations, psychiatric issues, are higher among the sexual gender minority youth involved in child welfare compared to the cisgender heterosexual peers. Other research looks at overrepresentation in systems involvement and our Black indigenous LatinX youth. And, finally, researchers are focusing more on this issue of sort of double minority status or intersectional stigma and also culture. And there's mixed results in this regard as well. There are studies that have found, for example, that being Black is protective against homophobia, which is counterintuitive to what Dr. Abreu pointed out, this sort of racist narrative of communities of color always being more homophobic or more transphobic, and we do need a lot more research in that area to look at culture and context as well as structural stigma. And, finally, my work sits at the nexus of all three of these intersecting types of populations where suicide is disproportionately overrepresented. The work that I do focuses on complex systems, and I use system dynamics and community‑based system dynamics as a way to help visualize and understand the complexity of these types of issues. You know, as our previous presenter pointed out, there's multiple pathways, but these pathways are happening simultaneously. So, some of our work is looking at the conceptual understanding of simultaneous factors that are impacting overrepresentation of SGM youth in systems and disproportionate mental health comorbidities. So, in this image what you'll see on the right‑hand side are three direct drivers: Harmful policy and practice ‑‑ in this case I'm looking at child welfare ‑‑ abuse and neglect because of one's sexual orientation or gender identity expression, familial rejection. Each of those can be a direct pathway to foster care involvement. The next thing I want to point out is for our kids, once they become foster‑care involved, first of all, they are more likely to be put immediately into a restrictive‑care placement. That means they are more likely to be put into congregate care, a group home, a residential treatment facility. Right? If they exit, if they step down into lower care levels ‑‑ for example, a foster home placement ‑‑ they are more likely to disrupt, they are more likely to have that placement say we can't handle you or we don't want you, and that leads back to going into a restrictive placement setting. This is a reinforcing loop called R1. It's called hard to place. This is an actual label that we give to kids in child welfare when we have a hard time finding a stable place for them to be, safe place for them to be. And the thing about systems is that systems are full of reinforcing loops. All right? And complex thinking, complex systems thinking, lets us identify where those reinforcing loops are, as well as pointed intervention. I'm not going to go over the entire model here, but I will direct you to the manuscript, the paper, if you want to think more about the simultaneous factors that are impacting youth outcomes for young people. And we lay them out as structural, institutional, interpersonal and intrapersonal factors which map onto minority stress theory and also extend it. So, what are we doing? All right. So, Cuyahoga County was one of four locations that was selected for a national demonstration project funded by the Administration for Children and Families. This is a four‑year demonstration project to transform child welfare, the organizational culture to enhance stability, well‑being, permanency, and safety for youth with diverse SOGI. I served as the local site evaluator for this four‑year project and the funder was ‑‑ the receiver of the grant was the University of Maryland. So, what we learned from this in terms of the child welfare component is safe identification, so a policy‑level thing. If we're not asking the appropriate questions of a young person, if we're not finding out about their sexual orientation and gender expression, then no other decisions are being made that include this key information. When we input safe identification, we move from identifying 3 percent of adolescents entering child welfare to 20 percent identifying as sexual gender minorities. There are some other components to this, but I believe there will be other speakers speaking on this later. I'm gonna move forward, because I know we are a little short on time. I see you there, Crystal. I'm doing my best. So, I'm gonna talk really quick about these three drivers again. We have biased policies within systems. Remember, a biased policy can appear neutral. Neutral policies still have bias inside of them. Without safe identification procedures, we have systems failing to identify a key factor that's related to young people's self‑interests, thoughts or behaviors, and then we can't refer to them. We also have young people who have been traumatized and re‑traumatized inside of public welfare systems, inside of behavioral health systems, and this is very real for SGM populations actually across the life course, that then we avoid care, we don't engage in care, and these things are problematic in terms of treatment. So, the two gaps we are now working on here in Cuyahoga County amongst these partners, because we continued to work together after the grants. The funding ends, but the partnership and the learning collaborative continues. We want system‑level safe identification of sexual/gender minority youth at risk of suicide. We want coordinated referral to affirming peer support ‑‑ I'll say why peer support in a moment ‑‑ and we lack specifically affirming peer support that's embedded in our current crisis response system, where our youth are overrepresented and underserved. So, this is the learning collaborative; it's many of the same partners. We've been working together now for eight years. Now, the learning collaborative approach is directed by community. It is not me, Dana, sitting in my office thinking, "Oh, I think I should research this." It's what does the community say is an issue and is it being echoed across different parts of the community? So, we have the LGBT Center, we have Youth Voices as very much a part of this work. Across the board, folks saying we don't have enough resources for youth when they're in crisis or on suicide for our queer and trans youth; we don't have them. And across the board, especially coming from the queer and trans community, we want to use our own community assets and resources as intervention. That's why peer support, okay. We know that persons with lived experience play a unique role in mental and behavioral healthcare delivery. We know they're under‑utilized in youth populations and in SGM populations, and so that's what we are currently developing together with our systems partners, with our community partners, and with our community activist partners. These are very different groups of people, but we come together with this common vision. So, the basic idea ‑‑ and I've talked about these drivers ‑‑ is really building out identification and referral of sexual/gender minority youth at risk of suicide. In juvenile court, that's a place where assessment happens. In child welfare, that's a place where assessment happens; and in behavioral health, that's where assessment happens. We need cross‑system identification and cross‑system talking to each other and also high awareness of the sensitivity of these data ‑‑ who can see the data, who can disclose the data, and always the youth owning their own data. Because we know, again, that these youth have experienced being outed by other people in system settings. If they're outed to the wrong person, it could have very harmful effects. And the second piece of this is working across these systems, then, to embed affirming peer support specialists inside the behavioral and mental health delivery system; that when we identify a young person to child welfare who is LGBT, who is screaming cautionary or critical on a suicide assessment, that we can track them and map them onto a peer support specialist. That's someone that has shared lived experience, that someone is gonna be queer or trans, that person is gonna be BIPOC. That person is gonna have overcome suicide themselves and is gonna walk alongside that youth and ensure that they're able to stay connected to their other types of treatment that are being offered. You know, is it a paraprofessional role? And also, to reduce self‑injuring behaviors, and to do that, we capitalize on lived experience. There's research showing that LGBTQ folks, in general, want to support others in their journeys. We have a history of creating our chosen families and our chosen networks of support. We have a history of taking care of one another, and this is another place where we can do that. So, I know that we're really short of time and this is a lot, but I'm gonna go ahead and end there, so we can have our other presenters have some of their time as well. And I thank you all very much. CRYSTAL BARKSDALE: Thank you. Dr. Conron. KERITH CONRON: Thank you so much. It's an honor to be in such good company with this crowd. My talk, I think, will be a bit shorter, and in many ways, I think it could be called a call to action. Things are bad and they're getting worse, and what can we do to make sure that we're studying the effects of public policies on the well‑being of youth moving forward. So, there is a large and growing population of LGBTQ high school youth. From 2015 at 8 percent to about 15 percent in 2021. There are an estimated two and a half million LGBTQ high school students. Now, the reason I decided to focus my talk today on high school students versus folks who are accessing higher education, which has been the subject of some of my own work the last few years, is because of the vulnerability that Skyler laid out earlier. Folks are earlier in the life course, dependent on parents, required to be in school, and that also places them at greater vulnerability. When we asked college people who had been in college if they had ever wanted to live in a different state or a city to find a more supportive climate, we found that almost one out of five LGBTQ people who were going to a four‑year college picked a different place to live to have a more supportive environment. They were four times more likely than their non‑LGBTQ peers to report that decision. And when we asked folks if they'd ever picked a school or university in another place to get away from their family, a third of LGBTQ people who went to four‑year colleges reported that decision, compared to about half as many of their non‑LGBTQ peers. So that information tells me that when people have choices, they move to more supportive places, and when they don't, we have an even greater responsibility to make sure that their environments are safe, and particularly in school settings, to make sure that people have the opportunity to learn. Inequities in mental health along the lines of sexual orientation and gender identity and known risks for poor mental health, including school‑based harassment, violence and child maltreatment, as other presenters have said, have been observed for quite some time, in fact, for over a decade. And here in Massachusetts where I've lived a lot of my life, we have seen this pattern of inequity and school‑based bullying for over a decade. Which leads some of us to say what the heck is going on and what are we doing about this and what can we do to change these patterns. I would also add that state policies and school climates have the potential to reduce or exacerbate observed inequities. And because there's been a lot of change, as many other presenters have said, in laws over time, both protective laws that confer protections for LGBTQ youth as well as harmful laws, there's an opportunity and a need to study the effects of these laws on youth, including the extent to which their effects are mediated through school environments. So, on the positive side, 21 states prohibit bullying on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, plus another two that confer enumerated protections along the lines of one characteristic or the other. We've seen in research by Ilan Meyer and others that enumerated inclusive anti‑bullying laws are good for young people, whether they're LGBTQ or not, in terms of lowering risk for suicide attempts and feeling safe at school. On the hazardous side, we've seen that many states, seven in particular, have banned discussions about LGBTQ people and issues across school curricula, and other states have restrictions on LGBTQ curricula in some form or another. Some states are banning the use of gender identity‑based pronouns. Eight states have passed parental notification laws that would out trans youth to their families. So now I'm gonna share with you a little bit of data from a study that we did with the Point Foundation in 2021 called the Access to Higher Ed Survey. It was a cross‑sectional survey that we fielded in the beginning of the year with the Ipsos Knowledge Panel. We had a sample of over a thousand people. They were adults 18 to 40. By design, half the sample was LGBTQ‑identified and 20% of the participants ended up being ages 18 to 24. We asked folks to tell us about their experiences in high school, community college, college, graduate school, all across the life course. We developed sampling weights that allowed us to present findings that reflect U.S. adults in those specific age groups. So, here's some findings from our 18 to 24‑year‑olds. More LGBTQ than non‑LGBTQ participants reported diagnoses of depression from healthcare providers, anxiety than their non‑LGBTQ counterparts. Why am I saying this? I've been looking at YRBS data now for decades, and while I think sadness and suicidal ideation and attempts are incredibly important, I would like us to start collecting more data about anxiety, perhaps even using the GAD‑2 on the YRBS. I think it is associated with exposure to violence and harassment. I'm gonna share with you a little bit of data about experiences that people reported in school climates, in part because I find the word bullying to really cloud the extent to which people are experiencing violence and harassment of different forms, in some ways presented as a normal experience of adolescence, when we know in fact that it's quite hazardous and also preventable. So, here's some of the experiences that people reported in high school, at least a few times a year when they were in school. In‑person bullying much more common among LGBTQ than non‑LGBTQ folks. Other bullying or electronic bullying is much more common, including texts, negative messages left at your locker, property damage also occurred. Sexual harassment occurred at school more commonly among LGBTQ folks than non‑LGBTQ folks. Importantly ‑‑ and I don't think this shows up often enough on surveys like the YRBS ‑‑ LGBTQ people reported experiences of sexual assault at school more often than non‑LGBTQ participants. It's important to remember that most of us when we're looking at data on lifetime sexual assault and sexual abuse, we see that it has a very powerful association with increased risk for adverse mental health, substance use, all kinds of negative outcomes. We don't often collect data about perpetrators or context. Some work that we've seen from David Finkel and others shows us that about a third of sexual abuse is peer‑perpetrated. Looking at some of my data, I can see that some of it is happening at school, and this is something that we need to start monitoring more carefully and not just the experiences themselves, but who are the perpetrators and what is the context and thinking about how to make school safe. As you would expect, fewer LGBTQ than non‑LGBTQ people reported a sense of belonging in high school. So, we collected some data ‑‑ this is retrospective ‑‑ about high school climates and what kinds of indicators of LGBTQ inclusion were present in high schools. About just over a quarter of people reported the presence of an LGBTQ student organization, like a GSA. That was the most common indicator of inclusion, and you can see that very few people were reporting any other indicator of inclusion. These items reflect the LGBTQ campus climate index, an informal version. And when we asked similar questions about other kinds of educational settings, we saw similar patterns, although higher elevation for folks in four‑year college settings are much more likely to report the presence of multiple indicators of inclusion. Community college environments look much sparser and look much more like the high school climate that we're looking at here. I'm presenting this because one of my suggestions is going to be that we monitor high school climates more robustly than we have been doing previously, particularly in large population‑based datasets, which is needed if we're gonna study the effects of public policies on the well‑being of adolescents. When we look at the indicators of inclusion ‑‑ and again, these are 18 to 24‑year‑olds; they are reporting about their high school environments in 2015 to 2021. So, this is retrospective, but half were in an environment with no indicators of inclusion, not even a GSA alliance, and only a quarter were in a place that had two or more. Had I had a better distribution, of course I would've shown you the whole spectrum, but all to say this is at least preliminary evidence that school climates are not particularly inclusive of LGBTQ people, and these are malleable factors and something that could be surveyed and efforts could be made to promote inclusion. Of course, perhaps not in places that ban LGBT inclusion and curricula. So, what we have is a series of policies that seem to counter what we know is helpful for LGBTQ young people, at least in terms of feeling a sense of safety and belonging. And this of course we saw in our data. This is an adjusted odds ratio. Folks who were in high schools in places with two or more indicators of LGBT inclusion were much more likely to report a sense of belonging than folks who attended schools with no indicators. So that's the school environment, but youth don't inhabit only one environment, as Dana showed us. They inhabit multiple environments simultaneously. So school, we can see, is not safe for many young people, but what about home? Well, home isn't always safe for LGBTQ people. This is sort of using some of the ACE’s questions about experiences of psychological abuse, frequent psychological abuse, emotional abuse, feeling unsafe, and also physical abuse, and we can see that it's higher for LGBTQ 18 to 24‑year‑olds than non‑LGBTQ folks, although a difference in physical abuse isn't statistically significant. In part, that's a sample size issue. I'm excited to see that there are some ACEs questions included in the 2023 national YRBS, which is amazing, but I would really like to see those questions included in the state core survey, so that we can look at the effects of policy environments on youth. So, in terms of future research, I'd love to see more studies looking at the impact of policy environments and the differences in school climates, in school‑based victimization, mental health, and other indicators of well‑being. We've had lots of great work over the last 10 to 15 years. Steve Raphelson, amazing work, and lots of other folks, Mark Hatzeneur, but we want to see some bigger studies, like difference in designs ideally to look at the effects of policies on health. State policies that require schools to out trans youth or other LGBTQs to their parents are likely to increase risk of child maltreatment. Research on the consequences and costs of these policies is needed. I would also say that, more generally, research in creating effective anti‑bullying climates is also needed, particularly strategies that look at promoting social‑emotional competency and supporting youth and having positive peer relationships. Thank you. SPENCER EVANS: Meg, I think you're on mute. MEG PACELEY: Thank you. It was bound to be somebody and today it was me. So, apologies, everyone. Good afternoon. I'm Meg Paceley. My pronouns are they and them, and I'm here with Spencer Evans, who is a wonderful Ph.D. student who works with me at UConn, and she will be co‑presenting with me. We will be sharing the state of the literature on state‑level legislation rooted in cis‑sexism and hetero‑sexism, as well as a rapid research study that provides some contextual understanding of how these anti‑trans and anti‑LGBTQ+ policies impact gender‑diverse youth. So, Spencer, I'm gonna turn it over to you to share some background. SPENCER EVANS: Awesome. Thank you, Meg. So, in the last three and a half years, we have witnessed a quickly increasing onslaught of anti‑trans legislation in states across the U.S. The first big wave of proposed legislation happened in 2021 with 125 proposed state policies that aimed to limit access to affirming recreational, school, and healthcare supports for transgender and LGBTQ+ youth more broadly. By the first half of 2024, we have seen nearly 600 proposed bills in 42 states across the U.S. These proposed bills affect nearly 300,000 young people across the country, a majority of whom are located in the Midwest and southern portions of the U.S. Here we have the risk assessment map, which includes the most at‑risk states for gender‑diverse youth designated in the red color. These states have enacted bans on gender‑affirming care for trans youth, and many also mandate detransition for those who had already begun to take hormone blockers or gender‑affirming hormones. The darker blue states represent the safest states with laws or sanctuary protections in place for protecting and affirming gender‑diverse youth, but Florida is the only state to receive a do‑not‑travel designation, due to laws that allow for the arrest of transgender people who use bathrooms associated with their gender identity and not associated with their sex assigned at birth. Most of the legislative aims of the anti‑trans policies focus on restricting access to gender‑affirming care for minors ‑‑ name and gender marker changes, the use of bathroom and gender‑ specific spaces, LGBTQ inclusive education, and sports involvement on gendered teams. Some of the legislation also aims to require public institutions to inform parents of youth's pronoun or name changes at school and mandates misgendering of youth via name or pronouns assigned at birth. Anti‑trans legislation includes the rhetoric surrounding the legislation. This may be stigmatizing, as well as the actual implications of policies when passed. Research on the structural stigma includes the impact of state‑level policies on the mental health of trans and LGBTQ people and indicates that discriminatory state‑level policies are associated with poor mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, stress, and suicidality, as well as things like discrimination and misgendering, which are also associated with poor mental health. MEG PACELEY: Thanks, Spencer. So, importantly, there's only a few studies that have explored the mental health impacts of the current onslaught of anti‑trans legislation: so, since around 2020 or 2021. This rapidly changing sociopolitical climate, as we've heard from other speakers today, is becoming more and more hostile toward LGBTQ communities and really most specifically transgender youth. So, this really warrants critical attention in the literature. As you can see here, we only located four peer‑reviewed studies that examined the mental health impacts of the current anti‑trans legislation on trans youth or on LGBTQ youth more broadly, understanding that research is very likely ongoing and just hasn't been published yet. Only one of these studies, which we'll talk about in more detail, included youth perspectives. Two included samples of parents and one included a sample of providers, and all collected data ‑‑ and all of these studies collected data in the early months or years of this current wave of anti‑trans legislation. So, prior to the amount of bills increasing so dramatically in the past two years. Despite this, we can see the findings echo what Spencer shared about broader structural and state‑level stigma with perceived impacts of these policies, including depression, anxiety, increased gender dysphoria and suicidality. We also heard earlier from The Trevor Project, who examined the impacts of state legislation on LGBTQ youth, and they found that LGBTQ youth reported significant impacts of legislation on their well‑being and that nearly half of trans youth reported their families considered moving to a different state in light of this legislation. So, I'm gonna talk briefly about a study that included a youth sample in early 2021, and this was the Trans Youth Speak Out study. This study was a community‑based participatory research group of trans and non‑binary youth. They had been meeting biweekly for over a year at the time of the study and engaged in trans‑related mental health research that was ongoing. They were also initiating new ideas as a CBPR group. Youth had an average age of 16. Four identified as trans‑male or trans‑masculine and two identified as non‑binary, and four of the six were white. So, it was early 2021, and at the time more than about 50 anti‑trans bills had been proposed across the United States and two were pending in the state that the CBPR group was situated. We were meeting biweekly. The group was engaging in ongoing research, but their conversations began to shift more and more towards legislation and the sociopolitical climate. So as these conversations continued, the youth co‑researchers approached us about getting information out quickly about the impacts of this legislation and the rhetoric surrounding it, both in our state and across the United States. So, the youth co‑designed this rapid research study. They were an essential part of designing and carrying out the entire study, including dissemination. So, discussions with our CBPR group were already covered as research and are approved by IRB protocol. So, the youth elected to engage as participants rather than spend time recruiting new participants going through a new IRB, and this enabled us to engage in rapid data collection and dissemination of findings and to share findings at the state level, with the goal of impacting the ongoing legislation. Youth participated in two online focus groups that were facilitated by me and a colleague. We led the thematic analysis and the youth provided ongoing feedback of that process. We identified three themes in their focus group data. These were focused on their perceived impacts on mental health, structural supports, and messages that they had for policymakers. And I'm going to share a few quick quotes for each of these, just to bring their voices into this presentation. So first, youth talked about increasing depression, fear and suicidality within themselves and their peers, other trans youth that they know. One shared that just the fact that these bills exist is harmful to mental health. Another said, "It makes me feel almost hopeless. Them passing these bills will definitely make the suicide rate higher." Another youth spoke of the fear they felt. "You keep hearing all these people that don't want you to exist. It's scary." Youth also talked about two potential structural impacts on their health, including increased barriers to affirming healthcare and decreased access to safety. One youth shared that having little to no gender‑affirming care will be really bad. Another spoke to the sense of unsafety. "It's just making fewer spaces that are genuinely safe, which is just horrific that we're going so far back in time." Finally, youth had important messages to policymakers about these policies. "When I hear people talking about trans‑youth and our bodies, it feels like it's going back to control. They want to control what other people do, and the bottom line, you're going to kill people by passing the law." So just a brief discussion. It's important to note that this study was a rapid research design. It was not meant to generalize across context or youth. It was really meant to provide point‑in‑time data in a really unprecedented and scary early onslaught of these policies. The study was also limited in that there were few racially minoritized youth and no trans‑feminine youth, but this study is also the only one that we could find that has collected data in a peer‑reviewed journal since 2020 that includes youth as the sample and emphasizes the impacts of policies, even when they're not passed or when they're still in the proposal stage. And I think this is a really key piece of this research, is that it's the policy and it's the impacts of policy, but it's also the rhetoric and the stigma associated with that rhetoric. So, I want to end with a brief discussion of the gaps in the literature and some future recommendations. Some of the most striking gaps we noted are just a general lack of research in this area since 2020 and 2021, really in terms of collecting data since 2020 and 2021, as well as a lack of population‑level data that explores the impacts of this specific legislation for youth, as well as how youth and others are responding or advocating for change. We also have very few studies that center youth as the sample, and we need more longitudinal studies to examine the impacts of these policies over time. Finally, we lack studies that explore the impacts of policies from an intersectional lens. Impacts on mental health from these policies likely vary based on gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity, the region of the country that people are living in, class, age, and other relevant social identities. So given these gaps and limitations in the research, we suggest a need for more cross‑sectional and longitudinal studies on the impacts of anti‑trans policies on trans youth, as well as examinations on the decision‑making processes of families with trans and LGBTQ youth in high‑risk states. For example, as we talked about earlier, there's some evidence that families are considering or are already moving to states with more protection. We don't understand that experience or the decision‑making that goes into it or the impacts of that move on the family. We also recommend research on the ways in which medical and mental health providers are supporting trans and LGBTQ+ youth in light of these policies. Finally, we recommend that funding priorities include opportunities to study these impacts on a broad scale across the U.S. Thank you so much, and we look forward to your discussion. CRYSTAL BARKSDALE: Thank you so much, Dr. Paceley and Spencer Evans. Now we're going to invite actually all of the speakers to turn on their cameras, and we'll have Brian Altman join us on camera to provide his remarks for the discussion. BRIAN ALTMAN: Thank you, Crystal. And if I could get my slides up as well, that would be great. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you so much for joining us. There we go. My name is Brian Altman. I use he/him pronouns and I'm the director of the National Mental Health and Substance Use Policy Laboratory at SAMHSA. I also serve as the LGBTQI+ lead for policy and programs at SAMHSA. I serve as our executive sponsor of the Pride Employee Resource Group here at SAMHSA and the co‑chair of the HHS‑wide LGBTQI+ coordinating committee of the policy subcommittee. So, I want to thank all of our presenters for their research and remarks and the work that you all have done to hone these research studies and the recommendations you have made as well. I think all of our presenters, as we know, highlighted that LGBTQ+ youth have higher rates of behavioral health conditions, including depression, anxiety, suicidality, and substance use, but we also like to emphasize, as many of them did, that it's not due to their identities themselves; it is due to the fact that they have faced discrimination, stigma, bullying, and harassment associated with being LGBTQI+ youth. Next slide, please. One thing I did want to highlight ‑‑ as many folks talked about suicidality as well as increased rates of suicide among LGBTQI+ youth and crisis services ‑‑ is that I wanted to make sure everybody knows that the 988 suicide and crisis lifeline has LGBTQI+ youth and young adult specific support available. Anyone can call 988, and if you're in texting you can text "pride" to 988 and receive the specialized services. If you call, you press three, and if you chat, you can identify in the pre‑chat survey that you would like these specialized services. There's a website here where you can find out more information about these specialized services. We do have a full sub‑network of crisis centers that answer these 24/7 specialized services activities. Though we know that crisis services are essential in addressing behavioral health conditions faced by LGBTQI+ youth, we obviously need to acknowledge and address the underlying factors that impact LGBTQI+ mental health and well‑being. And therefore, as many of our researchers talked about, family acceptance and family support are very key to this effort. That is why last fall SAMHSA launched an LGBTQI+ family support grant program. This grant program provides up to $425,000 per year for three years to community‑based organizations to provide a family acceptance project model and affirm caregiver trainings and workgroups, to help connect that family support and acceptance between the caregivers and parents and those LGBTQI+ youth. We have so far given out eight of these awards, for a total of $6.8 million. And thinking back to Dr. Abreu's presentation, one of the grantees currently is the Latino Commission on AIDS in New York City, and so they are obviously focusing on that very specific population that Dr. Abreu mentioned at the intersectionality of Latino youth. We also want to note that these interpersonal interactions are compounded by the structural stigma that LGBTQI+ youth are facing. So, we appreciate that Dr. Paceley and Spencer highlighted that there's been an increase in anti‑trans and anti‑LGBTQI+ legislation over the last few years and this has impacted the mental health of LGBTQI+ youth. I would note that Dr. Prince and Dr. Hereth discussed how adverse experiences and structural challenges are compounded for LGBTQI+ youth and those who are connected to child welfare and juvenile justice systems. In this realm, I would highlight some of the actions that my sister entities within HHS have taken recently. Some of you may have noticed that the Administration for Children and Families, which I know Dr. Prince referenced having a grant fund, they recently released a designated placement rule that notes that within the child welfare system and foster care, that the LGBTQI+ youth must be provided a designated placement that is supportive and affirming to them. And also, just last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ‑‑ I know Kathleen Ethier was on earlier. I don't know if she mentioned their recent document noting that the stigma and discrimination of LGBTQI+ youth should be considered in the adverse childhood experience, and so these actions taken by HHS are very interconnected with the presentations that we've heard from. We also know that Dr. Jackson discussed how there are positive factors like ‑‑ I call them SOGI change effort bans. At SAMHSA, we don't use the term conversion therapy, because we know that it doesn't convert anybody and it's not therapy. So, we tend to not use that term; we use sexual orientation and gender identity change efforts. And in this vein, last year we released the "Moving Beyond Change Efforts Report, Evidence and Action to Support and Affirm LGBTQI+ Youth." So, this report reviewed effective and ineffective therapeutic practices. It provided an update, an evidence‑based roadmap for supporting and affirming LGBTQI+ youth, and it offered guidance and highlighted resources for healthcare providers, educators, families, community leaders, and others. And it also ‑‑ as mentioned in the last presentation about policy levels, it talked about how we can improve the behavioral health of LGBTQI+ youth through different policy actions. So, we know there's much more research to be done as well, as highlighted in the last presentation, and this report also notes where there are research gaps that we could not speak about as definitively in the Moving Beyond Change Efforts Report. So, we know that we need further study on the impact of policy environments, school climate, cultural norms, anti‑LGBTQI+ rhetoric, and the intersection of systems and identities that are needed. But beyond research, we know that there are clear positive changes that can help protect sexual and gender minority youth and create an environment where we can live in. So, encouraging ‑‑ as this report did and our grant program does ‑‑ family acceptance and community support, as Dr. Abreu highlighted, positive school climates, as Dr. Conron explored, and instituting wider structural protections can help boost the well‑being of these youth. So, for our part at SAMHSA, we're strongly committed to continuing this work. And I think we have about five minutes. Six presentations are a lot in this segment. So, we have about five minutes for any questions that may be left for the presenters. So, Crystal, I don't know if you have one of those queued up for us or not. CRYSTAL BARKSDALE: Yes, we do. Thank you so much for your comments and thank you to the panel again. Wonderful presentations. And we do have actually a few questions. So hopefully we can get to hear your thoughts on a couple of these. So, a question from the audience. "Compounding stigma is harder for those of us who are disabled and are of two spirits, TGI, LGBTIAQ+ community. How can we address the multiple stigmatized impacts and causes for our folks when we are also living with multiple intersectional inequities that impact our health, brain health and mental health?" Big question, but, again, I think it gets to many of the issues and particularly social, structural factors and intersectional issues that many of you all addressed or alluded to. So, anybody wants to make an attempt at addressing that question? DANA PRINCE: Can you hear me? CRYSTAL BARKSDALE: Yes. DANA PRINCE: I appreciate the question. I don't know if I can address it the way that I would like to, but I absolutely ‑‑ as I am disabled, I care for a disabled child. Something I'm really pleased about with NIH is the recent move towards inclusion of more disability research. This has been a long time coming, and there's been a lot of community involvement from disability folks, disability leaders, researchers, activists to help shape that agenda. So, I think that ‑‑ you know, we know that folks with disabilities are also disproportionate in marginalized statuses as well, and at the same time I think the disability culture and queer disability culture has so much to teach us about how to care for one another, about how we share resources, about a lot of community types of response to the pandemic, for example. So, I think there's also an opportunity there to kind of center disability in a way that looks at disability culture as well. We want to look at race, ethnicity, culture. We also know disability is multiple cultures. It's not just a check mark of "Oh, yeah, I can't do these things." So, I appreciate the question. I don't have a big answer, but I am pleased to see NIH moving in a direction that focuses more on bringing disability as well as intersectional types of questions. CRYSTAL BARKSDALE: Great, thanks. Dr. Conron. KERITH CONRON: Just to add one thought, that I think folks who have R01s can really encourage students with disabilities and others to write supplemental grants to do small projects that build off of larger R01 mechanisms. I think it requires environments, though, that allow people to disclose disability without fear of stigma. So, I put that out there. I think there are lots of brave young people who are raised in a way that they feel they can just say "Hey, this is what's going on for me and this is what I need," which is amazing, but I would want to make sure we're also monitoring environments to make sure that they are safe spaces for people to disclose and to get the support that they deserve. CRYSTAL BARKSDALE: Great point. Thank you. Any others? BRIAN ALTMAN: I can see a question pop in, if there was additional opportunity to apply for the family support grants. So, we ran an open competition last spring and summer. We received 53 applications, and at the time we posted that there was a funding opportunity, we only had funding for four grants. We did find funding in the winter for an additional four grants. So, we got to a total of eight grantees, but we don't have any additional money at this time to post a new NOFO or to continue going down that list. Unfortunately, we made it only to a score of 93, and all 53 applicants scored high enough to be funded, if we had the funding. So, we don't have an open NOFO coming any time soon, but hopefully if there are additional funds provided, we could either run another opportunity announcement or continue going down the list of scored applications we've already received. CRYSTAL BARKSDALE: Thank you. Thank you for that information. Well, I'm aware of our time, and unfortunately, we are at our time, but I want to thank you all again for just an excellent set of presentations on a really important topic, particularly focused on the social determinants of health at the community, social and structural levels. You've provided us with incredible information on these important social and structural factors that impact SGM youth's mental health, and we greatly appreciate it, and from my perspective, I've certainly learned quite a bit. So, we thank you, thank you for your time, and we now have a break. So please enjoy, and we will be back, I believe, at 3:30. So thank you all again. [Break] Panel Discussion with Youth‑Serving Organization STACIA FRIEDMAN-HILL: Thank you. Welcome back from break. And, again, I'm Stacia Friedman-Hill. I'm a program director at the National Institute of Mental Health, and my pronouns are she/they.I am delighted to be able to introduce the last panel of Day 1 of our workshop. In putting together this workshop, one of the priorities of the planning committee was to include opportunities to hear from organizations which work with and represent sexual and gender minority youth and to also hear from LGBTQIA+ youth leaders themselves. And we are privileged to have representatives from four youth‑serving organizations join us this afternoon. From Advocates for Youth, we have Louie Ortiz‑Fonseca and Sebas Abbate. From the Human Rights Campaign we have Ted Lewis and Kei Smith. From It Gets Better we have Justin Tindall, Rae Sweet and Alejandro Jiménez de Ferry. And, lastly, from True Colors United we have Aleya Jones. I'm going to let our panelists introduce themselves and their organizations in more depth in just a minute. The discussion will be moderated by Dr. Tamar Mendelson, Professor of American Health and the Director for the Center for Adolescent Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Dr. Mendelson, I'll turn the discussion over to you now. TAMAR MENDELSON: Thank you so much for that intro. So, yes, my name is Tamar, and my pronouns are she/her. I am really honored to be here today with all of you, and very excited to be in conversation with our amazing panelists. So let me start by asking each of you to tell me a bit about your role within your organization, and perhaps at least one person from each organization can also say a bit about the mission. Does anyone want to go first? ALEYA JONES: I'm fine to jump in. Hi, everyone. My name is Aleya Jones. I use her/her pronouns. I work at an organization called True Colors United. I'll start with the mission. True Colors United implements innovative solutions to youth homelessness by focusing on the experiences of those who are most impacted, which is LGBTQ and BIPOC youth. So currently I hold two positions, actually. I'm a Senior Policy Officer, and I collaborate with key national, state, and local partners to educate and guide governors' offices and state agencies to ensure that the policies and systems are in place to end youth homelessness, and then I'm also the Senior Officer of Culture and Engagement, working to improve and enhance the structures, systems, human capital and management practices internally at True Colors United. TAMAR MENDELSON: Thank you so much. Great work. Who wants to go next? JUSTIN TINDALL: I'm happy to hop in there and introduce It Gets Better. I'll start with myself. I'm Justin Tindall. I use both he and they pronouns. And there's also a little MPH on the end of my name, which is really fun that this audience probably knows what that means when most of the audiences I work with aren’t that familiar. But I am the Senior Director of Programs and Operations at It Gets Better. Like Aleya, I think at most nonprofits we carry a lot of hats. So, similarly, I help lead our education and global programming while also helping us with the operations end, keeping the organization running. As an organization our mission is to uplift, empower and connect LGBTQ+ youth around the globe. We do that primarily through story‑telling, community‑building efforts, including on a global scale. And I've got two wonderful people here with me. Rae, do you want to go? RAE SWEET: Hi, everyone. I'm Rae Sweet, I use they/them pronouns, and I'm the Senior Coordinator of Education at It Gets Better, so taking all of our story‑telling efforts one step further and connecting it directly with LGBTQ+ youth like Alejandro. I'll pass it to you. ALEJANDRO JIMÉNEZ DE FERRY: Hi, everybody. I'm Alejandro. My pronouns are he/him. I'm youth voice along with It Gets Better. I served a really great two years with them learning how to really uplift and connect with my queer youth community. It was really great. TAMAR MENDELSON: Awesome. Thank you so much, all of you. Who wants to go next? TED LEWIS: I can jump in next. So good afternoon, everyone. My name is Ted Lewis. I use they/them pronouns. I serve as Director of Youth Well‑Being for the Human Rights Campaign. Most people know HRC for our C4 entity, which does political organizing around partisan politics and getting pro‑equality elected officials elected. I work on the foundation side, which is our 501(c)(3) entity. So, we work around education and advocacy on a smaller level for LGBTQ community members. We have several programs that work and focus on youth that we'll talk about today. I'm excited to be joined today by one of our amazing youth ambassadors, Kei. Kei, I'll pass it to you. KEI SMITH: Hi, everyone. My name is Kei Smith. I use she/they pronouns. I'm a second‑year youth ambassador with HRC. I'm specifically representing Illinois. And a lot of my work has focused on Asian‑American advocacy as well mental health advocacy. So, I've really enjoyed my time here and, yeah, excited for today. TAMAR MENDELSON: Fantastic. So, you're all doing really critical, really important work, and we'd love to learn more and go a little bit deeper. So next I'm wondering if you could each say a bit about some of the current projects that you are working on with your organization and specifically, also, how you're engaging young people in those projects. I don't want to sort of call on people, so I'll sort of open it up to you each to speak as you wish. TED LEWIS: I'll jump in. We're all kind of staring at each other awkwardly. So HRC has lots of various programs and initiatives. We have several that focus on youth and young adults. Welcoming Schools works with pre‑K through 12 schools. We have a Historically Black Colleges and Universities initiative that focuses on HCBUs across the country and works with about a third of them. We have an All Children All Families program that works around child welfare and foster care systems. And we have some new initiatives like economic empowerment programs, including Next Level, which supports young adults ages 18 to 30 around financial wellness and job readiness. We have a lot of different ways that we connect and hear from youth and young people. We do a survey roughly every five years with the University of Connecticut, and that gives us data on LGBTQ youth across the country. And we also have amazing young people like Kei who serve as youth ambassadors with our program who are able to assist us in learning more directly from youth in the current moment but also can help us shape programs in the future. Kei, I don't know if you want to add anything based on your experience with the Youth Ambassador Program. KEI SMITH: Yeah. So, in terms of the Youth Ambassador Program, I would say it's a really good network of people ‑‑ youth doing activist work within their local communities, and then we kind of come together, and I feel like we get to pool resources, ideas. So, it's a really great program where we're bringing a lot of our expertise to HRC, but we're also able to band together and kind of create a sort of network for ourselves so that we can rely on each other when we want to do advocacy for us locally. So, yeah. TAMAR MENDELSON: Thank you. And I need to apologize to Advocates for Youth. I moved way too quickly through our intros. So let me pause and give you both a chance to introduce yourselves, and then if you'd like, you can also address this question after you introduce. LOUIE ORTIZ‑FONSECA: No worries. I get it. 3:30 in the afternoon. People are ready for their afternoon drink, coffee, Judge Judy, the news. I'm Louie Ortiz‑Fonseca. I use all pronouns, but people get weird when you say that, so he/they. I'm Director of LGBTQ Health and Rights at Advocates for Youth. Really quickly, Advocates for Youth has been around for a little over 40 years. We're primarily known for championing sex ed to ensure that all young people have sex ed that is affirming, factual, and that is inclusive of young people living with HIV and young people who identify as LGBTQI+. But we all know that sex ed is this wonderful, beautiful umbrella, so a lot of the work I hold with the great team that I work with is our HIV work and our LGBTQ health and rights work. And in addition to working with community‑based organizations, organizing groups and national organizations, we work with a collective of youth activist cohorts or councils, depending on which staff you ask. Some people say council; some people say cohorts. I'm more the latter. And we have about eight of them. We have the Young Women of Color for Reproductive Justice, which is the collective of young Black and Brown women and nonbinary people who do work around reproductive justice; we have the Muslim Youth Leadership Council; and then there are two that I work closely with, which is ECHO, Engaging Communities around HIV Organizing, which is a collective of young people living with HIV who do work at the local, state and national level; and Youth Resource, which is a collective of LGBTQ young people who do work both in‑person and digitally around LGBTQ health and rights. And we have one of those representatives, Sebas, who does amazing work around mental health, HIV, and sexual health as part of Youth Resource but also as part of the great work that they're doing in their community in Florida. And I'll give them the mic so that they can talk a little bit about what they're doing and what Youth Resource does. SEBAS ABBATE: Thank you. Hi, y'all. I'm Sebas Abbate, as Louie mentioned. I also use all pronouns with a trey/he preference. I am based out of South Florida, Lake Worth Beach specifically. I'm going into my third year as a Youth Resource cohort member, which I am really happy and proud about. It's an amazing group of queer youth of color, specifically, doing work across the country. I've met some really amazing folks through the program. I specifically do work with young people in the capacity of HIV prevention as well. I work at Compass LGBTQ+ Community Center in Lake Worth, and I host our young adult program. So, I basically help people 18 to 30ish, we like to say, coming into adulthood, and I provide a social and support group space for them. So with that, I've also created a sexual health and education program called Pride and Pleasure, which is a really great program that actually gives people the chance to talk about our actual experiences and learn through a comprehensive lens about HIV prevention, mental health, sexual health, and all the issues that we're actually experiencing rather than the abstinence‑only education we're used to in addition to all the hate we're getting from every level here in Florida. So, my goal is to provide a safe space for all LGBTQ youth in my area. TAMAR MENDELSON: Thank you. And, again, apologies for the initial bypass. So, Aleya, would you like to speak next? ALEYA JONES: Yeah. That's fine. So, I would say, in general, all of our work is very much relevant to sexual and gender minority youth, and youth collaboration is a top priority, shapes the work that we do since all of our work is aimed at ending youth homelessness. We have an entity at True Colors United called the National Youth Forum on Homelessness, and it's a group comprised of exclusively young people who contribute to the national growing dialogue on how to make youth homelessness rare, brief, and non‑recurring. The forum ensures that the national conversation is informed and filtered through the perspectives of young people who have experienced homelessness and that strategies to end homelessness are generated by youth and adults themselves who have experienced it firsthand. I would say more on the advocacy level and some of the things I've been particularly involved with over the past year is any sort of state‑based work advocating against the rampant anti‑LGBTQ and anti‑trans legislation that's being introduced across the country, and we at True Colors United particularly focus on the dangerous trends that impact youth and young adults. And I'll talk a little bit about this later, but so often the dialogue around anti‑LGBTQ legislation is focused on adult populations, and so we really care a lot about making sure that youth and young adults are being talked about in that conversation as well. TAMAR MENDELSON: Thank you. And It Gets Better. JUSTIN TINDALL: Yeah, I'm happy to jump in. First off, I'm a huge fan of the other organizations that are here. I love the expression "it takes a village." Like, that's the world of nonprofits. There are so many nonprofits out there, but we're all trying to meet a particular need, and these ones are very special. So, if you're not familiar with them, dive into it online and get to know them better because they're great organizations. It Gets Better, we're probably best known for kind of our digital online story‑telling efforts, sort of PSAs. If you go onto TikTok or YouTube or Twitch or any of the wonderful platforms where young people congregate, you'll find us there trying to tell the stories of our community. More than anything, we try to hand over the mic to make sure that our community members can tell those stories to reach people with positive messages, with messages of hope, hopefully meet them before ‑‑ meet LGBTQ youth before they're ever in crisis, but even during, to help them navigate those tough times. Rae will tell you a lot more about that, but I do want to mention just two of our kind of programs that exist that ‑‑ to engage with LGBTQ+ youth offline, maybe off of their screens. One is a great program called "50 States. 50 Grants. 5000 voices," a grant‑giving program where we're able to distribute grants to schools across the U.S., up to $10,000 per school, to help them make change happen in their schools. In the past two years alone we've been able to distribute over $1 million to schools all over the country, which has been just an absolutely incredible, incredible thing to see. We love all of the schools and grantees that we've been able to support through that. We also just launched, actually a couple of months ago, Queerbook. Like a yearbook, it's a book of contributions of young LGBTQ+ people. They submitted poetry, art, photography, other wonderful elements that we were able to compile into a book and publish. Rae is throwing some great links in the chat. I think they're just going to the panel, but hopefully those can go out to the full audience as well. They're great links, so you can learn how you can ‑‑ you can learn more about them. But I'll hand it over to Rae to tell you more about the folks that we often hand the mic over to. RAE SWEET: Thanks, Justin. Yeah, I was sending the links in the wrong chat. Thank you so much, EVENT PRODUCER. Yeah, like I kind of said earlier, so Justin mentioned we're a story‑telling nonprofit, but my work is really connecting directly with youth. So, we do community engagement where we go into schools, classrooms, conferences, wherever we can go, sharing those stories, but also engaging with youth and educators in those stories and how to tell those stories in ‑‑ or bring those stories into classrooms. We offer resources like our Edu guides where educators can bring those stories directly into their classrooms, connect them to core ‑‑ what are they called? Oh, my gosh ‑‑ core standards for classrooms. And, yeah, a lot of really great resources online. But, honestly, one of our highlight programs is our Youth Voices, which Alejandro is an alumnus of. This is a group of anywhere between, like, 5 to 13 LGBTQ+ youth, depending on what year you look at, a group of 5 to 13 LGBTQ+ from across the U.S., ages 13 to 18, and they work with us for a full year, and we provide them with skill‑building, workshops, trainings, all kinds of opportunities to really build their skills and confidence in telling their story, in being able to tell their story in whatever ways and platforms they feel most comfortable with and connecting them with opportunities to tell those stories, whether that's at a conference, going live on Instagram, telling their stories to the New York Times or Teen Vogue. Those are some opportunities that the Youth Voices have had. So just connecting them with those opportunities to tell stories, and, again, with the mission to uplift and empower and connect LGBTQ+ youth. And I think really it comes from this need of like ‑‑ It Gets Better started with adults talking to kids, but I think kids want to hear from other kids. And so that's really where we're leaning more towards is getting youth more involved in supporting each other. Yeah. Alejandro, do you want to talk a little bit about your experience? ALEJANDRO JIMÉNEZ DE FERRY: Yeah, I would love to. It Gets Better was one of, honestly, probably the highlights of my high school career. I think that it was maybe one of the coolest things I did, not just because I got to pretend to be a celebrity and really tell my story, like who I was, but also because, you know, for the first time in my life, and considering the time back then, I feel like the first time in a lot of queer youth lives that that was the first time that anyone like me has ever been able to tell their own story, which I like to think that I have a pretty unique story. And it was just a really amazing thing to do. Something that I've recently been able to do is ‑‑ again, back to the Queerbook ‑‑ I was able to choose a lot of the entries that were submitted, which we had so many incredible entries. And it was just such an honor to go through such beautiful pieces of art that, you know, I was really able to resonate with. And it was crazy, you know. Back when I was working with It Gets Better, since I'm an alum now, it was really crazy to think that there were people like me out there, literally exactly like me, and then still, you know, there's just more of them coming out, and it's ‑‑ literally and figuratively. And it's just crazy. And it's such an honor to really be part of it, and I would really encourage everyone to check them out. I don't know if I'm allowed to answer questions, but there's a question that is asking if there's an online group in Spanish, and this is another It Gets Better plug. I don't know how many chapters there are, but there are a bunch of Latin American chapters of It Gets Better. The ones that come to mind is It Gets Better Mexico and It Gets Better Peru. I'm Peruvian, so shout‑out It Gets Better Peru. But, yeah, to answer that question and just the general question of I love It Gets Better, it made my life better, and that is my true facts. TAMAR MENDELSON: Thank you so much. And today there's been a lot of discussion about challenges that are facing LGBTQ+ young people, but also really want to hear from you all about what sources of joy are LGBTQ+ people finding right now. What are you seeing? ALEJANDRO JIMÉNEZ DE FERRY: I would really love to take this one. I think as an It Gets Better youth ‑‑ I'm 19 years old. I like to think that that's youthful. I don't know if that's a controversial take. 19 is pretty young in my mind. But something that I've found that brings me joy as an adult now because I'm 19, but also back when I was still younger, is queer media. And just the other day I was watching this movie. It's called Bottoms. It's a dark comedy movie. It's great. It's got a super diverse woman of color ‑‑ queer women of color cast, and that is one of the best things that I believe ever happened to me. I feel like ‑‑ right now, in the world that we are right now, queer media is genuinely at an all‑time rise. And it's something that is new to me. I've never seen this much explicitly queer music ever in my life. Some people that come to mind are Billie Eilish and Chappell Roan and ‑‑ oh, she played Regina George in Mean Girls on Broadway. Can't remember her name, but she is also queer. And it is just incredibly eye‑opening at how many queer celebrities exist and are coming out right now and queer media that exists and is coming out right now; not five years ago, not before my time, but now. And knowing that right now queer media is so big, that makes me wonder what's in the future. And I genuinely believe that I'm so blessed to think about what comes next. As a queer actor myself, knowing we have these trailblazers making this path for people like me, that's my queer joy. That's where I get so much queer joy is just ‑‑ it's incredible, and I'm blessed. I really, truly am. KEI SMITH: If I can jump in as well, I think for me I would say a lot of queer joy I'm finding is through solidarity between communities. I think often I've actively looked for queer‑specific spaces but also in other activist spaces and advocacy spaces. I think I've found a lot of allyship as well as just other queer people who are doing really important work. I work at a domestic violence organization right now for Asian‑American women and trans people, and that organization, it is largely catering to cis women, but there's a huge push now to actually start reaching out to queer people in the Asian community. And I'm finding that, like, there is a really big shift that's happening with solidarity between communities, trying to create those intersectionalities and intersectional spaces for each other. So, I find a lot of strength in that. It's really uplifting. And it is kind of depressing to see the news all the time and seeing how people are getting policed; but, at the same time, there is a lot of good work happening up there. You just have to go out and find it and keep building it up. JUSTIN TINDALL: I can answer that. I do think that, as well, representation is extremely important. I think there was a research study that came out just a few years ago where they're looking at young adult and children's books, and there was a greater percentage of children's and young adult books that had an animal as a protagonist than an LGBTQ person or a person of color. That is changing rapidly, thank goodness. Of course, we all love animals, but we love people to connect with people who come from our communities who look like us. I would say that's, like, something that I often get to hear from Alejandro and from the other young people that we work with is that if they're into gaming, if they're into crafting, if they're into table games, if they're into online spaces, if they're into photography, like there's so many spaces in the world where they can go and be themselves. And that is like a silver lining in a lot of kind of the state of the world and a lot of the attacks against LGBTQs that are happening in legislatures across the country is kids, despite that, are finding spaces in which they can thrive, in which they see themselves being part of where they can connect with other young people like them. That is radically different from my generation or from any generations before, and that is truly exciting to see. SEBAS ABBATE: Also, I can add that I think finding community is such a huge part of it, like everybody else has been saying that I'll echo. In‑person gatherings and spaces that are safe for us, like that's what's really bringing joy to myself and my community that I'm finding. Like we're having a queer beach gathering next week where we can express ourselves in the way we want to. A lot of the youth I work with don't come from safe homes that are affirming of their expression, so being able to, like, wear the bathing suit that you want and be able to just, like, have some (inaudible) in the sand and not worry about, you know, your family or protesters or anything like that, I think that's really important. And thankfully, Pride Month does have a lot of opportunities. It's almost, like, too many, like you can't choose which to go to, even down here in Florida. So that's really lovely is that we are still creating those spaces for us and by us, and that's what's really important is when it's actually by us, you know, when it doesn't feel like we're just being catered to, you know, with pink‑washing and, like, queer capitalism and everything, where we're actually like ‑‑ it's just us. That's what I really enjoy. Do I need to repeat any of what I just said? I just saw a message. TAMAR MENDELSON: I could hear you well. SEBAS ABBATE: Okay. TAMAR MENDELSON: Yeah. But that's a good reminder to all of us, I guess. Did anyone else want to answer this question? ALEYA JONES: I ‑‑ just from hearing everyone talks, something that's been really important at the organization I work for and just in general has been collective care. Right? Realizing that ‑‑ realizing how vital it is to lean on each other to find different supports and resources and reminders that we're not alone. And there's a certain obligation for us to not only check on ourselves but check on the people around us. But, again, just like communal care, collective care, we do not have to get through this alone, and I know in this society that can be very individualistic. It's important to uplift kind of that reminder that we can collectively get through this. And so that's ‑‑ what everyone's sharing just reminded me of collective care, and I wanted to put that into the space TAMAR MENDELSON: Thank you for sharing that. So please give me a signal if you still have something you want to say on this question. Okay. So, I will ‑‑ you've already ‑‑ some of you have touched on this in some ways, but I'm curious to hear from your perspective and your organization's perspective a bit about how you see LGBTQ+ youth contributing to their communities for the better right now. What are you seeing? LOUIE ORTIZ‑FONSECA: I think what ‑‑ going back to the last question, which connects to this, is that I've been in this work since I was a teen, and there was always a certain kind of young person that was elevated or provided a space at the table. Like there was this notion of what's going to make the movement or what's going to make the right really take us seriously, and I think that over the past couple years and with the advent of social media, that has changed. Right. LGBTQ culture has rightfully been reminded about its Black roots and being unapologetically Black and not having to quote, unquote, code switch in order to explain something or gain access to a space. And it's been wonderful to see that and advocates supporting them in the work that they want to do even if it challenges some of the notions of how organizing ‑‑ how we may think organizing should be done and when it should be escalated. Right? Expanding the conversation around what it's like to be queer beyond coming out, that's important, but, you know, when I was a young person, I was always out. I wanted conversations around mental health and what it was like to grow up with a mother and father who were addicted to crack. Like that conversation was never going to be had in terms of LGBTQ young people in the '90s. Right. And I feel like that conversation is happening now, like what does it look like for a complete LGBTQ young person, particularly those who are of color, what does that experience look like beyond just the identity part. Right? Because all of our identities are made with the sums of our parts. And I think that it's been wonderful to see that and have the opportunity to support that. You know, they've created a tool kit around how to divest from police and invest in sex ed, like how do we amplify and expand all of the work that they want to do but, at the same time, supporting them within that around the emotional and mental health. Right? Like how we create safer spaces. We're not direct service, but we still have a responsibility to support the young leaders that we are working with. And sometimes that means having, you know, workshops around protest safety, what does it look like for supporting mutual aid efforts locally so that young people who may have lost their jobs or who may not ‑‑ who may be out of work can have access to some money so that there's not one more thing for them to worry about. So, it's been great to see all of that in motion. Sometimes it feels like the movement is catching up, and then it sometimes feels like I have to catch up. And I think that while that can sound exciting, and it is, it can also be very exhausting. But I think that going back to what was said about community care, seeing that really be the foundational part of what LGBTQ identity is has been absolutely a learning experience and something that has breathed oxygen into all of our programs. JUSTIN TINDALL: I couldn't agree with all of that more. I ‑‑ gosh, this is a great group. Again, I'm a big fan of those organizations. I think that as adults, especially as adults who are educated, who work for major institutions, we often can feel like we have the answers. Right? We know what's best for LGBTQ+ youth. And I have learned over the course of my career that that is not always the case, that great intentions don't always lead to great impact or great success. Where I think It Gets Better has had the most success is, again, when we hand over the mic or we hand over the reins. That is kind of at the heart of that grant program that I mentioned. We don't prescribe what needs to happen in a local community with those grant dollars. Instead, we ask those applicants what your community needs from your perspective as a young person, what would make your school environment more welcoming for students like you and for the broader student body and being able to really listen to them and take into ‑‑ take to heart and really just believe that they know what's best has made the program extremely successful. So, I would definitely encourage all of you that have the opportunities to work with LGBTQ youth, take the time to just listen, to ‑‑ just take the opportunity to really learn and grow from what they have to share because it'll give you more wisdom than you possibly could get just from doing your job alone. TAMAR MENDELSON: Thank you. And just to repeat the question again as we move forward ‑‑ because I know a lot of folks here, and it's great to hear all of these perspectives ‑‑ how LGBTQ are+ youth contributing to their communities for the better at this time, if anybody else wants to weigh in on that. RAE SWEET: I'll chime in because I ‑‑ I'll out myself. I had messaged Tamar asking to repeat the question because I just wanted to make sure ‑‑ I have an answer, but I want to make sure I didn't go off ‑‑ but, yeah, something that's been really incredible with, like, working directly with LGBTQ+ youth is seeing the energy that is coming out and that they are bringing to the table even if they're not out. I mean, that has been really just, like, heartbreaking but beautiful to see these LGBTQ+ youth coming to It Gets Better saying I want to be a youth voice, I want to make a TikTok for you, I want to write a blog article for you, I want to apply for the grant program, I want to submit to Queerbook, whatever it is, but ‑‑ even if they're not out yet. And it's so tricky because we have to protect our young people. A lot of our work is very front‑facing, so we can only accept folks who are already out. But the energy is there even if they're not out, even if they don't have support of their family. I mean, we have had youth voices in the past who, you know, they signed up, they didn't have parent support, but they were able to make it work somehow. And that's just been really incredible. I mean, also seeing our young people giving ‑‑ testifying in public hearings, going to rallies and speaking at rallies, like it is just ‑‑ there's so much energy and there's so much passion and dedication and fearlessness that just ‑‑ it's really been incredible to see from young people, especially with everything that's going on right now politically. TED LEWIS: And I was just going to add to what Rae was speaking to that I think sometimes we forget ‑‑ because the community's made progress, we sometimes forget that the goalposts move with progress and that young generations who have ‑‑ like when I was a kid, the idea of a same‑sex couple getting married felt like it was never going to happen in my lifetime. That's the reality for most young people for the majority of their life at this point. That goal post is way behind a lot of young people. So, touting that as a success isn't helping LGBTQ kids right now, particularly queer and trans kids that live in places like Florida and Texas and Tennessee. And so, I think that it's helpful for folks me like who have been in this movement for a while to remember that past victories don't equal current things we can cheer about necessarily because it's not necessarily impacting the lived experiences of young people. Right. And then the other piece I would just add is that I think sometimes it's important to recognize that simply existing in the hostile state that we are in in the United States comes with a certain level of resistance that I don't often think young people understand. And today, with social media, one young person who puts something on TikTok could reach millions of people. And so, whether that's through It Gets Better, whether that's through HRC, whether that's through Advocates for Youth or True Colors, those voices have a way to reach places that they couldn't when I was a kid that I had to go to the library and find a book about that now you can click on your phone and access. But even simply a young person going through their high school day using a pronoun different from what people assume, coming out, inviting people into who they are, talking about their lived experience with even friends and family makes a huge difference. I can't tell you how many parents and caregivers have contacted us with questions and often talk about, well, luckily there's a kid down the street that's nonbinary who came out first that helped me understand who my kid is because they were already out. Right? And so, I think we forget that youth can be role models for each other often more so than adults because it's a peer and someone like them, and that that simple existing, particularly in the hostile environment that we see now, is a form of resistance, is a part of contributing to what is happening in the world. And living out and proud on the beach with your feet in the sand, right, at the Pride Festival, presenting in your classroom, but also just wearing a pronoun button pin, putting your pronoun by your TikTok profile, sharing who you are on X, all that stuff matters and impacts the community even if you don't directly see it in the moment. JUSTIN TINDALL: Ted makes a great point in one of those earlier comments that for generations I believe that queer youth in particular were kind of an invisible subpopulation of the queer community at large. I think that society often thought that queer issues were adult issues and, thus, a lot of the attacks on the queer community were focused on adults, whether it was housing discrimination, job discrimination, attacks against marriage equality, which still continue. But I do think that the more and more young people that are coming forward like Alejandro and Kei that are sharing their stories, their perspectives, saying we're right here and we know what we want, we know what we need, and we know what we want to do on behalf of our communities, I think that's where we've seen this shift and that the attacks have now ‑‑ are now largely focused on young people ‑‑ it almost feels as retribution ‑‑ for finally speaking up and giving a face to their community. That's very unfortunate. But at the same time, like Rae's point, these are incredibly resilient young people who are determined, they are passionate, they are energetic, and they're not going to let up even if the attacks continue to build. I think that they're making a difference in their community, for all the ways that Ted listed, just by owning who they are. That is a huge first step for most queer people, but more and more young people are getting there a lot quicker than previous generations. TAMAR MENDELSON: Just checking if anybody wanted to add to that or has another comment to make. Okay. So, I'm curious, too, about hearing about how each of your organizations works with others in terms of the projects you take on and the initiatives that you do. So, if you could speak a little bit about that and about working with others as a way to amplify and coordinate efforts, strengthen collective impact. TED LEWIS: Well, I'll jump in. So, I think that it's ‑‑ I also want to be transparent with you all. I work for the Human Rights Campaign. HRC doesn't have the best track record of partnering. Part of that is because of how the ‑‑ I'm going to get a little wordy here but ‑‑ the nonprofit industrial complex works. Yes, we have organizations that overlap in terms of our mission, and we're all needed in this movement. But it can also be hard to find our space for how we partner together while still carving out our own space to be able to get funding, to be able to get resources, to be able to pay people what they are needed to survive and do this work. So, I want to acknowledge that there are some hurdles into collective work, especially when you're in movement spaces that are already often underfunded, under resourced, understaffed. Right? And I think there are opportunities now where we're seeing, because of the political landscape, there is a moment for organizations who are not directly working with LGBTQ people or youth in particular to step up and meet the need of the moment. And so, like at HRC we have an initiative called Project Thrive which works with over 30 national partners, including folks like Advocates for Youth, one of our newer partners, that have a pledge on the thriving of LGBTQ young people as part of their work. And that includes people like the National Association of Social Workers, National Education Association, American Medical Association, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Boys & Girls Clubs, et cetera. And so, I think there is opportunities for us to approach, quote, unquote, mainstream organizations to get them to dedicate resources, time, and their presence, their collateral, their esteem in the world to uplifting LGBTQ young people. Any of the organizations on here can give you fabulous resources, research, and stories from young folks. And I would bet every one of us has heard from other professionals, well, it's biased because it's coming from an LGBTQ group or it's coming from a progressive group. But I think that there are opportunities for us to encourage other industries to start speaking up and making a difference. We've actually seen this help already in terms of legislation when people who are in professions such as mental health or physical health are able to talk about the harm that comes when you deny transgender kids age‑appropriate, necessary gender‑affirming care. That goes a long way in helping turn the tide, in addition to hearing from young people who are impacted, in addition to hearing from community advocates. It's really helpful. And I also see ‑‑ there's ‑‑ this is, I think, one of those questions where, like, we as adults can talk all day about what that looks like, but I would encourage our youth on here to also chime in, not just from an organizational standpoint, but where do you see those coalitions as well. RAE SWEET: I was ‑‑ Kei, you unmuted. No, you go ahead. KEI SMITH: No, That's okay. Sorry. I was just going to say, to add a little bit of youth voice since ‑‑ I mean, I am a youth ambassador, but I'm not necessarily staff at the organization. I do want to say that I think something that a lot of nonprofits can learn from in those kinds of spaces to learn from with youth organizing is, like, there is a lot of grassroots work happening within youth movements, and I think we're really good about connecting with each other and, like, pooling resources and kind of banding together. And I think that kind of also relates to the last question, like that's how we contribute to our communities is, like, we're really good at building community. So, I think that's something that, like, we are trying to bring to more nonprofit spaces and to larger institutions. So, I think that's something that we can all learn from is grassroots work. RAE SWEET: Yeah, I totally agree. I love this question because I'm really ‑‑ I love partnerships. And I think to what Ted said about, as nonprofits, we are understaffed, we are under resourced, and so partnerships is exactly what we need to be doing in order to fill those gaps. It Gets Better, especially our education department, we lean on our partnerships in a way that is mutually beneficial. And so, a great example of that is we partnered with Hope Lab in creating ‑‑ helping create IMI. IMI is a digital mental health resource tool for LGBTQ+ youth, and they needed LGBTQ+ young people to help create the app, and we had youth voices who needed work to help share their voices and help be involved in advocacy and mental health and all those things. So, we had our youth voices help create the app. They gave feedback, they were in focus groups, all kinds of things. That is one great example. Another recent example, an organization called No Filter reached out, and they were like, hey, let's collab. And No Filter is focused on creating safe resources for how to be safe online for youth. So, you know, you're on Instagram and TikTok and you're DM'ing strangers on the internet. Like how do you that safely. And as a digital nonprofit, we're putting our youth out there online, and we want them to be safe, and so how can we bring those together. So, we had both of our youth cohorts come together to create a guide on how to be safe as an LGBTQ+ person online. We crossed our two missions together and had both of our youth come together and brainstorm and create a guide, and that guide will be coming out soon. It's not out yet. But just finding those ‑‑ those intersections, like ‑‑ it's there. It exists. So, what is your mission, what is our mission, what are the gaps that we can fill, you know? And I think we've built a lot of programs where it's kind of built in where we can have those opportunities. So twice a year we have a career day. And so, if I'm collaborating with corporate partners even ‑‑ oh, you want to be engaged with our youth? Come to career day. Come share about your life as an LGBTQ+ person in the corporate world. Wherever you can find opportunities to connect, I think it's really important to fill those gaps because we're under resourced. Yeah. Thank you. STACIA FRIEDMAN-HILL: And, Rae, there's a question in the Q&A box asking: Will you say more about the app, whether they're free, how to get them maybe. RAE SWEET: Yes. Absolutely. They are free. They're not a downloadable app like you go into the app store. It's a web‑based app. So, you just type in ‑‑ I think we just typed the link. Thank you. It's IMI.guide. IMI.guide. And it's just an easy‑access digital tool, and you can click through and do a little five‑minute activity and it should boost your day. Yeah, that's a great one. And then No Filter is also linked there. Thank you for the question. TAMAR MENDELSON: Thank you. Folks from Advocates for Youth, do you want to speak to this? LOUIE ORTIZ‑FONSECA: Can you repeat the question? TAMAR MENDELSON: Sure. So, the question is about ‑‑ the question is about how your organization works or partners with others to amplify impact and strengthen collective impact. LOUIE ORTIZ‑FONSECA: Right. This is weird. They probably don't want me to be able to plan. No, I kind of think of everything as kind of like a record label because music is my favorite thing. Right? So, there's things that make sense in amplifying, maybe the policy asks or maybe to make something sound even more beautiful. Right? So sometimes it is driven by the connection you have with someone and sometimes it's like your supervisor saying, "Make this work." And both things can turn out to be beautiful. But all of the things that are outward facing that we partner with do not see the light of day without getting reviewed by our young people. So regardless of if I think the partnership may have not been the best use of my time or if I think it was the most transformative, amazing thing, right, which is more of the reality most of the time, all that stuff still has to be reviewed by young people. Right. And I think knowing that helps us to figure out what makes the most sense and who we partner with. Right? Let's say that we're that girl and that we get to choose, but some things, you know, it's not in our wheelhouse. Right. We did some support around community ‑‑ I used that term earlier, when you share funds ‑‑ mutual aid. That's when a large organization says, hey, we want to partner with you with mutual aid. That's not our lane. Right? So, yes, we want to partner with you, but that's not our lane, so let's pass this off to over here because this is what they do. So, partnerships are also knowing what we can bring to the table, what are the opportunities, but also not being led completely by the opportunities because sometimes we're just not that ‑‑ we're not the best organization to do ‑‑ to support that work when a lot of times it should be community‑based organizations. But, again, because the young people who we work with like Sebas review everything, like, that keeps ‑‑ that helps to keep us grounded in our mission, in our vision, in our goals around who to partner with regardless of personal feelings. Right? Because this work can be personal. Right? Sometimes we bring everything we have to this. So, I would say for us, the young people ‑‑ sounds cliche ‑‑ serve as our guide. And I'm not sure if Sebas wants to add anything. Even like what ‑‑ how we partner with our young people, we don't tell them what to do in their community. Right? They kind of run their ideas by us. We may fund some of their projects, and we support them, but ‑‑ and connect them to partners, but it's for them to decide what works best for them. Because I'm not in Florida. My family is. That's why I'm here in D.C. But I'll turn it over to Sebas, if they have anything else to add around partnerships, to speak from a youth perspective. SEBAS ABBATE: Thank you. I'm trying to figure out, like, what I can add to this. I think, like, I really enjoy being able to form those partnerships, especially within Advocates for Youth, because you have that, like, national space, where I'm limited in my job at Compass where we're very, like, county‑specific. Right? And so, we just work within, like, the nonprofit complex here, like everybody has, like, these grants and these grants, and we can just share, like, part of the pie, and it's kind of limited with what resources we have where, like, we have youth. Like we'd like to serve, but, oh, no, you're just, like, one city too far away. So being able to have, like, a national space and, like, a digital space can be so empowering because you can reach everybody that, like, maybe space or, like, physical space is a limiting factor for. So that's something I really enjoy, especially with, for example, HIV AIDS awareness days. That platform can reach the voices that it ‑‑ or the ears that it needs to and being able to amplify the voices that, like, need that amplification, right, that we just, like, don't have the ability to do on our own. And I think being able to find that strength in community is really (inaudible). TAMAR MENDELSON: Thank you. And, Aleya, do you want to speak at all about partnerships that True Colors United engages with? ALEYA JONES: You know, I think so much of what was already said is what I was going to add to the conversation. But I would love to answer the next question first. I just don't want to ‑‑ TAMAR MENDELSON: That's fantastic. Let's do that. Okay. So ‑‑ and I see we're coming up on time here. I feel like you all have so much amazing input to share. I wish we had a longer time. But this workshop is sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, and they have a research focus, and so I would love to hear you speak a bit about the kinds of questions and the types of data that you wish researchers could provide that would be impactful for the work you do. ALEYA JONES: I'll start this one. There was one question I really wanted to answer because I wanted this space to hear it, so I'm going to answer the question I wanted to answer ‑‑ TAMAR MENDELSON: Yeah, you answer the one you want to answer. ALEYA JONES: Is that okay? I gotta talk about this. TAMAR MENDELSON: You answer what you want to answer. ALEYA JONES: Okay. So, this is a question about the trends and needs that we've seen from sexual and gender minority youth over time and something I really wanted to amplify in this space for particularly, like, unhoused youth is that, in a very general sense, there's a lack of comfortability and safety that LGBTQ young people are facing navigating various systems and environments such as, like, shelters. Right. Many youth shelters are actually very homophobic. They're not suitable for sexual and gender minority youth, and we have to name that. Right? Because often you might hear a narrative of, oh, well, there's shelters. Just because there's a shelter, it doesn't mean it's safe for folks. Right. There's actually not a lot of protocols put in place for LGBTQ youth in shelters, safe‑based shelters (inaudible) discriminatory against trans communities in particular. So, for instance, folks are not able to use showers that match their gender identity. And another general trend I've seen over time is that Black trans youth are dying, are being killed. Right? And I know that we've centered joy in this experience too, and I think that's important, but I also think it's vital that we name that Black trans youth need to be protected. And while we've made progress over the past five years, we also have to name the way violence does show up against Black trans bodies, and it needs to be eliminated. We need to talk about it, and we need to figure out ways to protect our Black trans youth. So that was one thing I really thought was important to name in this space. In terms of research, I'm actually particularly interested to hear about how what's happening at, like, state levels in terms of anti‑LGBTQ legislation, how it's literally impacting young people on the ground. But I don't want it to just be data. Right? I don't want it to just be, like, data‑driven. I want it to actually be story‑telling and narrative‑sharing, amplify what numbers already exist, but by way of young people really being able to use their voice to say this is what it feels like for me going to school during this time or this is what it's like for me just being myself every single day, as someone else mentioned. Those are things that I would love to see, just more qualitative data. I'm a big qualitative, story‑telling kind of gal, and that's what I would love to see. So yeah. Thank you. TAMAR MENDELSON: Thank you so much. Advocates for Youth, do you want to take this next? SEBAS ABBATE: I have a perspective that I would love to be amplified which I've come across in my work a lot, especially recently, is ‑‑ well, I work a lot in the HIV prevention field, and so we deal with a lot of HIV studies, right, or, like, any other studies in the safer sex/sexual health realm. And so often the voices or experiences of, like, trans masculine people just don't exist in these studies. And it's so frustrating because it affects me, it affects my friends because, like, we might have a uterus or we might not, but, like, the cis women that are being studied, like they have different experiences than us. Their medication might be different, like if we're taking testosterone. It's just really frustrating. And also seeing, like, trans feminine individuals being lumped in with cisgender men. It's just really frustrating that our experiences are still not being amplified, and then the companies that are doing the studies keep just saying, well, like, it's so hard to find the population, because it's not. We are here, and we do want our experiences to be represented. Right? You just have to do the work of finding us, because we also want, like, safer sexual, like, health and lives. We just ‑‑ we have to put in the work to find us, right, or, like, partner with the organizations that do work with us, right, to, like, create that bond. That's just something I'm really passionate about, something I'm in discussion with my community a lot about is just that, like, we don't have that representation, and it's really frustrating, especially for, like, people of color, the numbers go down, like, way more. So that's my platform. Thank you. TED LEWIS: I'll just add one thing really quick, and it's that a lot of great research is being done and then you lock it behind a paywall that most nonprofits cannot access. We rely on our college interns to actually access the great research you all do. So, my big ask of researchers is to get your data and your information and your research out there into the public sphere, make it accessible. A 500‑page research project is great. Can you partner with someone to make some infographics, can you give me top lines, can you send the information directly to folks that work with you that work in community? Because most of you are doing amazing, fantastic, cutting‑edge research. We don't find out about it until five years later when it's finally accessible. TAMAR MENDELSON: That's a really important one. Thank you. How about It Gets Better? JUSTIN TINDALL: I have the honor of being able to participate on an advisory committee with Equality California, because we're based here in California, for their Safe and Supportive Schools Report Card. Essentially Equality California puts out a report card saying how well are districts across the state performing in terms of their support for LGBTQ+ students. And that survey is mostly filled out by adults saying, well, we have these policies in place or we're doing these various things at our schools to be able to support LGBTQ+ students. But if you would ask LGBTQ+ students at those schools if those policies or if those resources actually reach them, the answer would probably be no. And so, I would just love to see research that includes more perspectives of young people, including in terms of what recommendations should be provided to accompany that research. Again, I think that young people know what they need a lot better than we think that they do, and I would just love for data to come with "and here's what the youth who participated in the survey or in this study have to say on the matter." Not just how they're impacted but what can be done to change it and make it for the better. TAMAR MENDELSON: These are all fantastic suggestions for those of us who do research, so we appreciate that. Thank you very much. I know that we're now at 4:32. Stacia, let me turn it to you. STACIA FRIEDMAN-HILL: Thank you. Thank you for doing a great job moderating this discussion, Dr. Mendelson. And thank you to all of the representatives of the organizations who are able to join us today. I think that was a really great note to end on to really sort of tie together all of the panels that we heard today and that we're going to hear tomorrow is to think more about how this all fits together, how do we make our research translatable into action. And I hope that we can keep that in mind. So, again, I really want to thank all of you for participating in this conversation. We're not done yet for the day. I've asked one of my colleagues who's in the Office of Disparities Research and Workforce Diversity to close out our day for us, so I'm going to pass the baton to Beshaun Davis. And, again, thank you, everybody. This was really wonderful. BESHAUN DAVIS: Okay. Thanks, Stacia. And I know people have been really engaged in really great discussions today across all the panels, especially this last one. So, first of all, I just want to thank Stacia for organizing this workshop series. It's been a great conversation. We've had a lot of really ‑‑ we've heard about a lot of really great research today, so it's been really wonderful. Like Stacia said, I'm a colleague from NIMH. I'm in the Office of Disparities Research and Workforce Diversity where I'm a program director for minoritized populations mental health research. And so, as a part of that, the reason why I'm closing out today is because a big chunk of my sort of portfolio is the sexual and gender minority mental health research portfolio. So, it's really great to hear about all the sort of cutting‑edge research in this area and also to hear from all of the community organizers and the youth today who are doing work in this space. So, I just want to second what Stacia said in thanking all of the speakers and researchers and panelists today. This was a really great ‑‑ really great day to hear about all the sort of work that's being done. And we've heard a lot about a bunch of different areas. Right? So from that first panel on the measurement of sexual and gender identity sort of data, developmental trajectories and trends, we heard a lot about this idea of like ‑‑ I think one key takeaway I got was this idea that, like, creating an environment that's affirming for LGB students in schools does not just improve the mental health of LGB students; it improves the mental health of all students. Right. So, I think, you know, there's this idea that, like, when we sort of tailor to the most marginalized folks in our society, that it is a benefit to everyone. Right? It's not just ‑‑ it's not just for LGBTQI+ individuals; it's for everyone. So, it's really great. And I think that's a huge benefit. You know, we've heard a lot about the improvements that are happening and how like ‑‑ you know, I think in the last panel we talked about the idea of the goal posts being moved. Right? Like 20 years ago, 30 years ago, we would have been talking about very different issues, but there's so many parts of the community that need to be ‑‑ that have needs that are not being addressed by the current mental health care systems. Right. So, it's really great that we're hearing about some of the research in this space, you know, thinking about including more diverse and intersectional samples in the research world and really addressing, you know, some of the concerns of LGBTQ+ youth like at multiple levels. Right. We've talked about systems‑involved youth and how it can be really tough for systems‑involved, like, LGBTQ+ youth to be placed in certain ‑‑ in foster care or group homes and things like that. And so, this just speaks to the stigma and the sort of disadvantage that's not fully being addressed by the systems that we have. Right. And so, a lot of the work that was talked about today involved community‑engaged research and, you know, really centering the perspectives of the youth. And that was really great hearing about how the research can be shifted in that direction. So overall I think we've had a really great day hearing about a lot of really great research, and I think that it was really fitting that we ended with this panel of all the youth organizations and some of the youth who are really involved in doing ‑‑ you know, advocating for change for LGBTQ+ individuals. I think it was really great to hear about, you know, how lots of these organizations were empowering youth to tell their stories, to build community, and to get access to much needed resources and information as well as, you know, not only focusing on sort of, like, this deficit model; there was this focus on strengths. Right? That the youth can sort of form community and share their experiences and talk about, you know, media and representation and things like that to really, you know, have a positive effect on trajectories of so many ‑‑ so many youths. So, all of that to say this was a really great day. Tomorrow we'll be covering a broad set of topics, as well, under the umbrella of, like, more community‑engaged research, risk and resilience across individual, interpersonal and family levels, as well as services, intervention, and prevention research. So, I hope all of you will come back tomorrow and that we'll get to hear about some more cutting‑edge research in this area. So, thank you all, and we'll see you tomorrow. STACIA FRIEDMAN-HILL: Thank you, Beshaun. And we're ready to close the day. EVENT PRODUCER: Thank you, everyone. And we'll see you tomorrow morning.

Drivers of Mental Health Disparities for Diverse, Rural, LGBTQ+ Communities [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.nimh.nih.gov/news/media/2024/drivers-of-mental-health-disparities-for-diverse-rural-lgbtq-communities)

> Drivers of Mental Health Disparities for Diverse, Rural, LGBTQ+ Communities Transcript SHAUN DAVIS: Hi, everyone. My name is Dr. Beshaun Davis. I am here from NIMH. I'd like to welcome you to our Office of Disparities Research and Workforce Diversity webinar series. Today we're kicking off our webinar series with a presentation on rural LGBTQ mental health by Dr. Sarah Murray and a team of her collaborators from across Johns Hopkins University and Emory University. So, first off, I want to welcome you all to this webinar series and thank you all for coming. Just for, by way of introduction, I'll sort of share a little bit about sort of the goals of the webinar series. In general, we have this webinar series every year, and we tend to focus on promoting research from investigators focusing on minoritized populations, women's mental health, rural and American, Alaska Indian and Alaska Native mental health, workforce diversity, social determinants of health and a wide variety of topics related to disparities in mental health. So, we're kicking off with this one focusing on rural LGBTQ mental health for a couple of reasons. To start, oftentimes in the research on the LGBTQ+ community, we tend to focus on people in urban or sort of suburban areas, and oftentimes the LGBTQ community in rural settings is kind of left behind. There's often people talk a lot about the sort of "it gets better" messaging in that campaign from a few years ago, where oftentimes the message was, it gets better, you move to a big city and things get better for you. But there are tons of queer folks who live in rural communities and their mental health concerns are just as important, right? So, the work presented today will highlight some of the concerns of folks in rural communities as well as looking at unique risk and protective factors linked to suicidality, depression and a variety of mental health outcomes for folks in these communities. So, I'm going to hand it over to Dr. Murray in a moment, but before I do, I just want to briefly introduce her, and she can introduce her wonderful team who are all here and will be co‑presenting today. So, Dr. Murray is an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University, where she does a variety of work on sort of minoritized populations and particular work focused on minority stress and the impact of that on mental health concerns. Some of those key themes will be present today in this presentation. And so, by way of just making sure we have enough time for them to present and to get all of the wonderful insights from this study that's underway, I'm going to go ahead and stop there and hand it over to Dr. Murray to continue with introductions of her team and to get started with the presentation. Towards the end we'll do a moderated Q&A. So, if you have questions, please put them in the chat throughout, and we will answer them in the last 30 minutes of the webinar. So, thank you all for attending, and I'll hand it over to Dr. Murray. SARAH MURRAY: Fantastic, thank you so much. I'll get my screen shared for everyone. Okay. Good afternoon, folks. My name is Sarah Murray. Thanks so much to Dr. Davis for the introduction. I am thrilled to be here today to share with you some of our ongoing efforts at better understanding stigma and discrimination and how they may drive mental health disparities for diverse, rural, sexual and gender minority communities. In particular to tell you about our ongoing NIMH‑funded study, on note as we begin, we're going to try to be consistent with terminologies as we go through, but I recognize that there are multiple terms that people use when talking about gender and sexual diverse communities and that they may not always perfectly coincide with the way people describe their communities or their own identities. So, we're using the term "sexual and gender minorities, consistent with the NIH research office, but we do appreciate that this is an imperfect term. The work we're presenting today is supported by a big, wonderful team. I feel so fortunate to get to work with all of the smart and thoughtful researchers listed here on this screen. Our team is mainly divided across two institutions. So, Prism Health at Emory Rollins School of Public Health under the leadership of Dr. Travis Sanchez, who is a co‑leader but also someone I consider a mentor, and at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. And not to be forgotten we also have Dr. Jennifer Glick, who is now at Louisiana State University. Given our large team and collaborative structure, you won't only be hearing from me today, but as Dr. Davis introduced from some of the other folks who are really essential to making this work happen. So, Savannah Winter is program coordinator at REALM and focuses on LBGTQ community building resiliency and empowerment and is coming from a background of community advisory work. In addition, Mariah Valentine‑Graves is program director of REALM as well as two other large national survey studies hosted by Prism Health. She has a passion for health equity, harm reduction and technology‑informed and innovative recruitment and retention of research participants and has stayed at Emory after completing her MBH. And at Hopkins, my colleague/assistant/research professor Dr. Shoshanna Fine, whose research encompasses two frequently overlapping areas ‑‑ assessing risk and protective factors for the health and psychomental health and psychosocial development among disadvantaged adolescents around the world and evaluating culturally appropriate prevention and intervention strategies. Kirsten Siebach is at MSW and is currently a PhD student with interests in the impact of the structural environment on the well‑being and mental health of the LGBTQ+ community. And I'm a psychiatric epidemiologist whose research focuses on using mixed methods to understand and intervene upon pathways between violence and stigma and mental disorders globally. The zen of much my research focuses on better understanding experiences of stigma and discrimination among sexual and gender minority adults. And I really have a passion for intervening to build environments in which sexual and gender diverse folks can fully be themselves and thrive. I also just want to note that this presentation does contain discussion of suicidality. And on the screen, we have listed some of the resources that we remind our participants of. And we want to remind you of them as well, in case someone you know or yourself should ever need them. We're not necessarily endorsing any one of these in particular, but as someone for whom mental health treatment has been really instrumental, I just want to take a moment to encourage us to take care of ourselves and each other. Moving into our rationale for the study, I think many of you will be familiar with some of those disparities in mental health that are documented as being experienced by SGM folks. But briefly and globally, overall, gay, lesbian, bisexual individuals have been found to have over twice the odds of reporting a past‑12‑month mental disorder relative to heterosexual individuals. In the U.S. specifically, we see elevated prevalence of mental illness and suicide among sexual minority adults relative to heterosexual adults and among individuals who are transgender or gender diverse relative to cisgender folks. To provide a few examples, the study using 2015 NSDA data found that one in three sexual minority adults compared to one in five heterosexual adults reported a lifetime mental illness. And data from the same year, from the national transgender survey, found that nearly 40% of transgender adults reported a serious past distress as compared to 5% of the general population. And 40% also reported a lifetime suicide attempt, and 7% a past‑year attempt. These disparities are really pretty staggering. They've been documented as occurring across the life course. And I think that's really important. For instance, sexual minority youth have been found to have three times the odds of suicidal ideation compared to heterosexual peers. And longitudinal research has shown how these disparities persist as adolescents move into young adulthood. As people age, we see similar patterns, actually. For instance, middle‑aged and older gay men and bisexual women were found to have twice the odds of mental disorder and bisexual men, three and a half times the odds relative to heterosexual peers. Unfortunately, much of the literature, particularly outside of adolescents and young adulthood, is cross‑sectional. There's definitely a need for longitudinal study with adults. How do we begin to make sense of this disparity in poor mental health and suicide? Well, increasingly we see from research that stigma processes from the structural level all the way to the individual level work in concert to drive risk for sexual and gender minority communities. Probably the most common framework we used to unpack this is that of minority stress. The framework conceptualizes gender and sexual minority stress processes that occur distally or external to the individual, such as experiences of discrimination driven by heteronormative social structures and also by cisnormative social structures and also structural stigma reflected in laws and policies. And these distal processes really shape proximal processes in turn that are internal. So, things like the internalization of stigma in anticipation of stigma by minoritized individuals. And there are critical psychological processes in response to these experiences such as coping and emotion regulation, how we engage in social interpersonal relationships and cognitive processes that ultimately shape if and how mental health is affected by these stressors. I want to highlight a recent example of this in the literature of this framework being applied to understand mental health disparities for gender minority communities specifically. Wilson and colleagues conducted a recent systematic review and were actually able to find studies among 47 different samples that looked at stigma in association with mental health disparities for gender diverse folks and found that both distal and proximal stressors were correlated with both depression and anxiety as would be expected in the minority stress framework, notably, with the proximal stressors generally showing stronger associations. Though they did note a need for greater rigor and measurement of distal factors. And notably as well few studies assessed suicidality, and those that did varied a great deal in how it was measured. So, this really couldn't be analyzed across studies. To summarize, while there's great research out there documenting mental health disparities for SGM folks and understanding how minority stressors and stigma may drive these disparities, much of our knowledge, particularly among adults, is based on cross‑sectional studies. A lack of longitudinal data really prohibits us from actually unpacking these effects as they relate to risk with attention to factors that are going to be modifiable by intervention. Notably there's also some limited heterogeneity still on how we're engaging sexual and gender minority populations in research with relatively less research on transmasculine non‑binary folks and lesbian and bisexual women. The current literature is also very risk focused, and there's a real need to understand protective factors to promote interventions that could actually foster positive mental health and work from a prevention framework. So given that, I'd like to explain a bit more why we set out to do our longitudinal study among heterogenous STO sample, building upon early efforts at integrating minority stress and suicide theories and specifically why we're focusing on rural communities. So, if we go back to our minority stress framework, there's been some great efforts at actually starting to unpack the right side of that framework I showed you earlier where we had suicide listed in that far right box. This really is a complex outcome that involves ideation or thoughts about death or harming oneself or ending one's life. But these thoughts only progress to action or an attempt to end one's life, thankfully, for a minority of people. Ideation to action frameworks have been developed to spell out this pathway in more detail and allow us to consider how predictors may actually vary throughout that process. The most widely used intent to action framework is the interpersonal psychological theory of suicide, which highlights things like thwarted belongingness or an unmet need to belong, which we can pretty easily imagine how that might be driven by stigma and perceived burdensomeness. So that is really sort of how people understand themselves as being or not being a burden on others. And that can reasonably be understood as a reaction to things like economic marginalization that could actually be the result of distal gender and sexual minority‑related stressors. And these factors are hypothesized to be even more proximal to suicidal ideation than mental disorders themselves. Capability for suicide lies on the pathway from ideation to action and may be affected by things like sensitization to loss or pain that can potentially be a result of exposure to trauma and experiencing trauma, but also could be affected by things like access to means to actually enact one's plan for suicide and impulsivity. And we're starting to see support of this in studies with sexual and gender minority populations, so Teston [phonetic] colleagues looked at theories in conjunction with one another to understand suicide disparities experienced by transgender folk and found that thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness mediated the relationship between distal and proximal minority stressors and suicide ideation. So, with that I want to turn it over to Kirsten to tell you a little bit more about why we want to base the study in rural areas specifically. KIRSTEN SIEBACH: Thanks, Sarah. To shift gears, we want to focus on why we're focusing specifically on rural SGM communities. To date, research among SGM communities has focused almost exclusively… SARAH MURRAY: We may have lost Kirsten. I think we may have some Internet issues. I apologize. I'm going to jump in and fill in for Kirsten until we can get her back because I might be a poor substitute for her, but bear with us while we get her back. I think what Kirsten was beginning to explain is that there are actually 46.1 million Americans who live in rural areas in the United States. And approximately 3.8 million of those identify as sexual and gender minorities. To date, research among sexual and gender minority folks has focused almost inclusively on those who live in urban settings, not totally but predominantly. The studies in rural areas have actually tended to focus on youth, a very important population. But we also just really don't know much about the experience of SGM adults living in rural parts of the country. Yet, rural sexual and gender minority populations might have unique experiences that are important to understand so we can design interventions to improve outcomes. We might infer that rural sexual and gender minority populations have limited social connectedness or capital because of their gender identity and/or sexual orientation as well as other intersectional identities. They may have access to fewer affirming spaces and there may be higher religiosity that could be unaffirming of diverse identities and lower access to mental health care. And all of these factors can really contribute to poor mental health outcomes. Importantly, I think we may also find unique strengths and aspects of rural life that may promote mental well‑being among the rural SGP community ‑‑ sorry, among the rural sexual and gender minority community. Close family ties and strong community networks potentially could provide opportunities for increased social support, if families are supportive, and could be an established protective factor against poor mental health. And when we go back to our framework that we looked at before, I feel like there is sort of an urge to say we think rurality matters in our analyses. We can put interaction to the term the risk is higher for rural versus urban individuals collected on this population. And then we sort of check the intersectionality box, right? But I think the point we want to make today is that when we think about how and why rurality matters, we need to actually think across this whole process. So, if we start over here in the distal minority stressors box, it may be that rural sexual and gender minority folks could experience a very different policy environment compared to urban folks. So, what you're seeing here is a map from the Movement Advancement Project that documents more than 50 sexual and gender minority‑related laws and policies and creates a policy tally. And we can immediately see that these regional differences may correlate with degree of rurality in terms of whether and how much people are actually exposed to negative or harmful policies and the lack of supportive policies. If we move to the psychological processes box, we can think about overlaps as it relates to economic marginalization of these communities and economic change and hardship and job loss that may actually disproportionately impact minoritized communities and contribute to things like hopelessness and perceived burdensomeness. We can also think about a greater degree of potential social isolation in small communities where there might not be established networks or affirming spaces like we mentioned. But also, I think something that's been really overlooked is the many ways in which religion and religiosity may actually look very different in rural America. For instance, both religiosity and attendance of religious services has been found to be higher in rural versus urban areas. And in theories of suicide, religiosity in the study as a protective factor. And there's actually support for this in the general population. But conversely, a greater importance of religion has actually been found to be associated with greater recent ideation and attempts for young sexual and minority adults for suicide. And things like sexual‑orientation‑change efforts, 80% of which are implemented by religious leaders, have been associated with twice the odds of suicide ideation and greater attempts by sexual minorities. And you might imagine, in rural areas, if your religious institution is supporting and engaging in those kinds of harmful practices and endorsing stigmatizing attitudes, there may not be many or any other options to engage a religion or foster spirituality like you may have in an urban space that might be affirming. And if we move to think about capability, one thing we know that's incredibly important and related to access to means in the United States for suicide is gun ownership. You can see from the map on the left, states with a high level of gun ownership also have a high level of rurality, meaning that that's something you really need to consider in thinking about whether the research from more urban spaces is generalizable. Given the range of risk factors that could be present in the rural sexual and gender minority communities is the fact that there's really limited research among sexual and gender minority adults in rural areas. We felt it was really important to focus in on this population. So, with that, I'm going to pass it over to Dr. Shoshanna Fine, who I'm hoping whose Internet is working, to give an overview of the REALM study that has grown out of this concern and this need. SHOSHANNA FINE: Thank you so much, Sarah, and hopefully everybody can hear me, and my Internet stays good. We're going to switch gears now, and we're going to talk about the aims of the REALM study and specifically about how it fills the key gaps and evidence that was just covered so well by Sarah. So, REALM stands for Rural Exploration and Approaches for LGBTQ+ Mental Health. As Sarah mentioned, REALM it's a collaboration between Johns Hopkins University and Emory University, which builds on Emory's really strong prior work recruiting and collecting working with SGM persons online. And it's funded by an R01 through NIMH. The overall goal of the study is to build longitudinal evidence within rural SGM populations on the complex and often quite nuanced interrelationships between minority stressors, such as stigma; mental health conditions, such as depression and suicidal behaviors. Specifically, we're focusing on around 2500 SGM adults living in rural areas of the U.S. And we're also intentionally sampling a diverse group that includes both sexual minorities and gender minorities. Next slide. I'm now going to briefly walk through the three aims for the REALM study alongside their associated methods. So, the first aim is to determine whether classes of stigma, discrimination and traumatic experiences vary across subgroups of rural SGM adults and whether these classes are associated with an increased prevalence of depression, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. In order to carry out this aim, we're using online processes to recruit and enroll a diverse sample of up to 2500 SGM adults, aged 18 plus, again, living in rural counties and small metropolitan areas of the U.S. This sample includes five distinct subgroups. So we have 500 cisgender women who identify as sexual minorities; 500 cisgender men who identify as sexual minorities; 500 persons who were assigned male at birth and identify as a woman, female and/or transfeminine; 500 persons who were assigned female at birth and identify as a man, male and/or transmasculine; and finally 500 persons who identify as sub‑other gender, including nonbinary, gender nonconforming and/or agender, regardless of sex assigned at birth. Also, in order to explore differences by race and ethnicity across these subgroups, we aim to enroll racial and ethnic minority persons at a level that's, at a minimum, representative of the national demographics of the rural U.S. I'll leave a more detailed description of our online recruitment processes to my colleagues, but I'll mention that all potential participants go through screening, a very rigorous process of identity validation and informed consent prior to filling out the baseline questionnaire. So, to carry out aim one, we'll be using baseline data from the study to conduct a latent class analysis, or LCA, exploring how clusters of distal minority stressors may be differentially associated with mental health‑related outcomes. Specifically, we'll be using LCA to identify clusters or classes of participants based on their patterns of endorsement across indicators related to stigma, to discrimination and to traumatic experiences. And we'll then use a latent class regression approach to assess associations between class membership, on one hand, and prevalent depression, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts on the other. Initially, these analyses will be conducted separately and compared among the five SGM subgroups. And we'll explore variations by age and by racial and ethnic identities. The second aim is to determine whether the classes identified in aim one is associated with an increased incidence of depression, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among rural SGM adults. You'll notice that first aim focused on cross‑sectional prevalence, and this aim focuses on longitudinal incidence. In order to carry out this aim, we're following the baseline cohort over a 12‑month period with participants asked to complete follow‑up questionnaires every 3 months, including 3‑month, 6‑month, 9‑month, and finally 12‑month questionnaires. To carry out aim two, we'll be using this longitudinal data to conduct Kaplan‑Meier and Cox proportional regression models to describe the associations between the latent classes of distal minority stressors from the previous aim and then the incidents of depression, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts over the 12‑month follow‑up period. As before, these analyses will initially be conducted separately and compared among the five SGM subgroups and subsequent analysis will also explore stratification by age and by racial/ethnic identities as before. Also, guided by the theoretical framework that Sarah presented earlier, we'll also be exploring potential mediators and the relationships between our distal minority stressors and mental health‑related outcomes. So, for example, we'll be exploring the role of psychological risk and resilience processes, such as hopelessness on the risk side and coping skills on the resilience side; proximal minority stressors, such as internalized homophobia and transphobia; and additional mental health conditions, such as substance abuse, anxiety and PTSD. The third aim moves beyond simply evaluating the relationships between minority stressors, mental health conditions and suicidal behaviors to really better understand how to actually intervene upon these relationships. And specifically, we aim to measure preferences for technology‑delivered preventive interventions for depression and suicide tailored to rural SGM persons actual experiences of stigma, discrimination and trauma. Aim three will be accomplished through a discrete choice experiment, or DCE, with REALM participants. Without going into too much depth here, I want to describe DCEs in slightly more detail, as I know this isn't a familiar method for many folks. So, at its essence, DCE is a health economics method that can be used to elicit and quantify stated preferences from people, i.e., what people say that they want, in the absence of revealed preferences or what people actually do. And this is really useful because it allows us to explore and place a value on products or services that don't actually exist yet. One of the basic assumptions of DCEs is that people make tradeoffs when engaging in a decision by choosing an alternative of a product or service that offers them greatest utility or benefit. So, during a DCE, participants are presented with a series of hypothetical scenarios in which they have to choose between two or more alternatives of a product or service, with each alternative consisting of a specific set of components or attributes, as they're known in the DCE lingo. And the structure of this experiment allows us to actually quantify the relative utility of each of these components. In our case, we'll be using a DCE to quantify the relative acceptability of theoretical components for a technology‑delivered intervention targeting depression and suicide among rural SGM adults. So, the types of components we'll be assessing in this case will likely include things like cost, social networking capabilities, content moderation approaches and specific therapeutic strategies. In order to develop the theoretical components for our DCE, we'll start by looking at preliminary findings from aims one and two to understand which risk factors may be most important to target in this population. We'll also carry out consultation with stakeholders who have specific expertise in technology‑delivered mental health interventions. And after the 6‑month follow‑up, we'll conduct a series of qualitative interviews with selected participants, first to directly elicit their preferences around technology‑delivered interventions, and then to help refine the content of the experiment itself. All of this groundwork will lead up to the actual DCE, which will be carried out with all study participants who complete the 12‑month follow‑up. And the ultimate goal here, of course, is to inform the development of a novel technology‑delivered depression support and suicide prevention intervention with findings from the DCE used to help ensure that the intervention's content and delivery strategies are tailored, acceptable and relevant to SGM adults living in rural areas. So now I want to move us into the next section of our presentation, which is focused on where things stand to date in the REALM study. To start, we'll be talking about considerations related to our measure’s selection, including how we have built strength‑based perspectives into this work. We'll talk about our community advisory board, staff training and safety procedures. And finally, we'll update you on our ongoing recruitment efforts, including both baseline recruitment, as well as our 3‑month and 6‑month follow‑ups. I'm not going to spend a lot of time talking about our measures, but what I do want to emphasize is that, in measured selection, we prioritize the selection of validated tools that have previously been used with SGM populations. Our mental health‑related measures are listed on this slide with our primary outcomes in gold. And as you can see, we're using the PHQ‑9 to measure depression and the Electronic Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale, or eC‑SSRS, to measure suicidal ideation and attempts. And for both of these measures part of the appeal is that they're relatively brief and can be scaled to measure both lifetime experiences as well as experiences since last assessment. Again, I want to just briefly mention our minority stress related measures here. You can see that we have two primary measures, including the LGBTQ‑related stigma and discrimination scale, which was developed and psychometrically evaluated by our team among SGM populations, both domestically and internationally, and which measures perceived anticipated and enacted stigma as a result of sexual orientation and/or gender identity. And we have the intersectional day‑to‑day discrimination index, which assesses general experiences of discrimination, microaggressions and harassment. Okay. So finally, you can see here some of our measures on psychological processes, including hopelessness, perceived burdensomeness and religiosity. These measures are intended to tap into our theoretical framework and specifically to understand some of the important mediators in the relationship between minority stressors and mental health outcomes. And now I think to talk about some of our strength‑based approaches and measures I'll turn things back to Sarah. SARAH MURRAY: Thanks, Shoshanna. In addition to our process of measurement selection refinement, we also early on, as a team, decided it was really important to bolster our assessment of protective factors and positive mental health in a more strength‑based approach. To that end, we developed several additional aims we hope to accomplish that will repeat some of our person‑centered approaches to identifying patterns, but in this case of protective factors like social support and access to gender‑affirming care across our cohorts. Then we want to look how changes in these patterns over time predict flourishing or what in positive psychology might also be thought of as thriving or a broad conceptualization of human well‑being. And potentially we think this might happen through reducing internalized stigma. We will also look at these protective patterns as potential moderators of the effects of distal minority stress on depression and suicidality over time. And this is just a list of some of those protective factors that we will be measuring and that we are measuring, and the scales that we are using. For the outcome of flourishing, we'll use the secure flourish scale, which looks at things like happiness and life satisfaction, health, meaning and purpose, character and virtue, close relationships and financial/material stability, which really come from these domains of flourishing or the proposed (indiscernible) view. And I'm going to turn it over to Savannah. SAVANNAH WINTER: Hi. This is a video. Hi. So, one of the major priorities of our work was ensuring that we had a community‑steered, community guide set of processes and implementation of our actual survey and just the recruitment efforts. So we set forth from the beginning to recruit from across the country, including Puerto Rico, members of community organizations, individuals and so forth who would broadly represent, in terms of the diversity of everyone in the country that we're trying to reach, so looking for not just those five subgroups but also ensuring we have racial and ethnic diversity, having age diversity, diversity of experience both in terms of working in the community as well as, say, people who have come out later in life as opposed to people who came out earlier, things like that. We have rotating membership. Our CAB members are paid. We want to make sure they are able to provide us guidance while also ensuring their time and involvement are respected and properly compensated. They've provided for us a lot of really important suggestions, one of which I think I saw in the QAs asking about Internet connectivity. And that's something that the CAB very much pushed us to address. And one of their suggestions was working with community libraries and other organizations which have ‑‑ that serve as pillars of their community that will be accessible to people who may or may not have otherwise have access. They helped us broaden our ideas of how we recruit people from just simply using the Internet. So, kind of hybridizing our recruitment measures. They also imparted upon us importance in having transparent language because there is a lot of justifiable distrust towards research community at large, as well as just, since we are government research, understandable concerns with that. So being transparent, being open with our participants about compensation, confidentiality and things like that. And they also imparted upon us the importance of having advertisements that didn't just come off as hokey or fake but making sure we were using real human beings in our ads, not just some corporate‑looking stock photo that gets the idea across but doesn't actually humanize what we're trying to do. I think that's all I have. Oh, I'm so sorry. But just in general, they let us know that we can't just rely on some of the same tactics we've used previously because, I mean, previously these people have been overlooked. And we have to understand why we've been doing that. And so, they've been absolutely instrumental in our work. Thank you. SHOSHANNA FINE: All right. So going into some of the prelaunch training and building of safety procedures that we incorporated into the study, so given the focus of our study and given what we know about existing mental health burden among our population, in particular, we wanted to make sure that, one, we had a robust safety protocol in place before we started the study; and, two, that all of our staff that were going to be interacting with study participants had adequate training and access to suicide‑prevention resources if they needed it. We have two study clinicians who implement our safety protocol, and they have advanced degrees and training in counseling with LGBTQ populations. They have found that motivational interviewing as well as community resiliency model training have been particularly helpful in guiding the phone sessions that they do with phone participants. Just to give a little bit of background, motivational interviewing is a counseling approach designed to help people find intrinsic motivation to make positive change in their lives. And this style of interviewing really guides the phone interviews that our nurse practitioner has regularly with our participants. And then community resiliency model training focuses on understanding the impact of trauma and chronic stress on the nervous system. And so, it teaches how to regulate your nervous system in tangible ways and how to teach that to others so that folks are better able to withstand stress. And it ideally hopes to promote resiliency. So, some of the other trainings that we had staff complete, QPR was a big one. It's a suicide prevention training that trains what the program refers to as gatekeepers to be able to recognize the warning signs of suicide, and in particular to do what they call question, persuade and refer people for help who are at risk for suicide. We had all staff trained for QPR, graduate research assistants, clinicians, full time coordinators. Anybody who would be interacting with study participants, we wanted to make sure that they were prepared for the possibility that some sort of escalation could happen, not solely in counseling sessions but even on the phone or in a social media comment on our ad, that type of thing. We had clinical staff complete counseling on access to legal means which was a course that provides skills to reduce access to lethal means, in particular, access to medication and firearms. We had clinical staff trained in Stanley‑Brown Safety training, which is a brief intervention to help those experiencing self-harm and suicidal thoughts with concrete ways to mitigate risk and increase safety. And those strategies are documented in collaboration with a potential participant or client on this safety planning form that you see here. It can be used virtually or over the phone as well. And then lastly, we made sure to have all staff familiarize themselves with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, which is the national hotline for suicide prevention. And that's our primary referral org. So, we had staff familiarize themselves with this service by having them call and text the hotline individually before we launched to see the process that participants would go through and how much time it takes to get connected. We did this for both the English and Spanish phone and text lines. And the crisis line operators were very amenable to answering questions. Of course, we kept everything very brief so as not to take time away from urgent calls. But they do encourage researchers and folks who have questions can also reach out through the hotline. Great. And then in terms of recruitment and retention, our baseline recruitment is ongoing. As of last week, we had enrolled 1,492 participants. So, we're about 60% of the way to our total goal. As mentioned, we're aiming to recruit 500 participants per cohort. And so, we have enrolled around 66% of our cis male cohorts, 52% of our cis female, 47% of our transmasc cohort, 68% of our transfemme cohort and 65% of our nonbinary cohort. Our 3‑ and 6‑month follow‑ups are also ongoing. A quick note about our retention estimates that we have here. So, each of our follow‑up surveys have a target date and then a window period for participants to complete. The best‑case scenario listed here is an estimate of when all participants who are within their window period complete the survey. And then worst‑case retention scenario is an estimate of when all participants who are in the window period do not complete the survey. So best‑case retention estimates are attainable if participants in that window are contacted frequently encouraged to complete. We do have a process where we do what's called last‑chance reminders for people who are within 25 days of their window closing and then 9 days of their window closing. So, for our 3‑month follow‑up, we have 898 participants that have reached this follow‑up point with a worst‑case of 91% and a best‑case of 94. And then for 6‑month we have 594 participants that have reached this point, with a worst‑case of 75 and a best‑case of 96. And our 9‑month follow‑up will begin in about a month, at the end of September. SARAH MURRAY: Great. So, we would like to share with you now some very initial patterns that we're seeing in our first interim dataset of our baseline sample. So, this contains 770 of the nearly 1500 participants that Mariah just told you about that we've recruited so far, with the caveat that we expect that these may shift as we continue recruitment and finalize our baseline analyses. We see fairly similar distributions of age, race, ethnicity education across our cohorts and overall see our sample in the beginning has trended young, with just under three‑quarters of our participants under age 35 across the cohorts. This is something we've been working to address in recruitment. And this will be discussed more by my colleagues later. We also see that about 75 to 85 percent of our sample by cohort identifies as white. So, in particular we're looking to improve recruitment of Black and Hispanic LatinX participants. And, again, you'll hear more about that in a few minutes. And that's so we can be in line with what we see overall as a distribution of race/ethnicity in the rural U.S. population at least, if not more diverse. And we see some differences in education across cohorts, but overall, in general about half our sample has a college degree or beyond. On the left of the slide, you'll see a respondent by state for this sample. And this is something we're tracking to ensure that we don't have one state dominating our population in a region and that states that are less populous, that have a large percentage overall rural population are being fully engaged. Our regional distribution is on the right. And we had disproportionately higher recruitment in the south Atlantic region, and actually relatively lower in the Mid‑Atlantic region. And that's really helping us target our recruitment going forward. This is something that's shifted a bit over the continued recruitment, it's happened ‑‑ that's not represented in the sample yet. We've also been concerned that in trying to recruit a rural sample based on ZIP Code and the U.S. Census Bureau's Urban Rural Classification Scheme, we might end up recruiting from communities that mostly fall in small metropolitan category, which is a statistical area with an urban center that has a population under 250,000 people but over 50,000 people. But what we see here is that only about 40 to 50%, roughly of participants across cohorts are coming from those areas. About 30 to 40% of our participants are coming from micropolitan areas that have an urban center under 50,000 individuals but more than 10,000. And around a fifth of our sample is coming from noncore areas where there's no urban cluster of 10,000 people or more. So that's been encouraging. For our primary outcome, one of our primary outcomes, depression, for descriptive purposes, we have classified depression symptoms measured via the PHQ‑9 as none or low is a score 4 under, mild with a score 5 to 9, moderate with a score of 10 to 14, moderately severe with a score of 15 to 19, or severe with a score of 20 to 27. Across our sample, most participants fall in the none or minimal category, fortunately, so over 50%. However, across our whole sample we see that nearly a quarter actually fall into the moderately severe or severe categories, unfortunately. And when we look at this distribution by cohort, we see that the percentage is relatively greater falling in those categories in our gender minority cohorts than in our sexual minority cohorts. When we look across regions, we see that in particular the East/North Central region has the highest depression scores, average depression scores, relative to other regions. And ultimately, we see, interestingly, a similar distribution of depression scores across our noncore micropolitan and small metropolitan areas. Moving on to suicidality, when we look at responses to the C‑SSRS, our suicidality measure question, about ever having thoughts of harming oneself or killing oneself, we note that lifetime ideation overall is quite common. It ranges from 57% of the cisgender male sexual minority cohort to just over 80% of the transmasculine cohort. Again, this distribution is very similar across rurality. And it's actually more consistent than depression was in its regional distribution. When we look at intention and attempts assessed via the C‑SSRS question ‑‑ have you ever done anything, started to do anything or prepared to do anything to end your life; I want to note here, this is a little bit broader than just suicide attempt and really is a broader suicide behavior question in that it also captures preparatory action ‑‑ we see that this, again, is more common among our gender minority than our sexual minority participants, generally speaking. But it's particularly high among our nonbinary cohort. That's 40% of the sample have endorsed ever having those behaviors. And our transfeminine cohort was 35%. But all cohorts had a prevalence of lifetime endorsement of this greater than 25%. And there's some differences across rurality and geography with a higher prevalence in noncore areas and then the mountain region of the United States. Looking at scores, switching to sort of our main exposure of interest being stigma, in this case we're giving you an example of daily discrimination, or intersectional daily discrimination. Importantly, the scale, as a higher score, indicates greater frequency of these experiences. And the total score can range from 0 to 27. We see overall more daily discrimination being reported by gender minority participants than our sexual minority participants, with relatively similar scores by rurality ‑‑ slightly lower for small metropolitan areas, but not so much. And the greatest frequency of daily discrimination experiences is being reported in the West/South Central region, so that's Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas. When we look at flourishing, please note here that a higher average scale score indicates a greater degree of flourishing, and the range is from 0 to 10. There's a similar distribution for all of our population cohorts, but we do see the scores are just a bit lower for our gender minority cohorts than our sexual minority cohorts. So overall I would say these differences may not be as stark as what we saw for the negative mental health outcomes for depression and suicide. And while scores are relatively similar across rurality, with participants in small metropolitan areas fairing slightly better, we see participants in New England having higher scores than those in other regions. So good on you, New England. I think this is a really encouraging thing to be seeing given some of our other findings, that flourishing is what we're seeing here. Just some summary of some early patterns that we're seeing. Cisgender sexual minority. Cohorts are tending to report a lower level of stigma compared to gender minority cohort participants, but stigma experiences overall are quite common. Other distal stressors, like adverse childhood events and things we didn't show here have tended to follow the same pattern. Levels of poor mental health and suicide ideation are not too dissimilar from what we generally see in the literature and are much higher than what we see in the general population. We see worse outcomes here for gender minority cohort participants relative to sexual minority cohort participants and slightly better positive mental health outcomes among our cisgender sexual minority cohort. But these are actually more similar across cohorts. And this pattern follows some things that we didn't show you like resilience and social support across cohorts as well. And, again, I think in general these flourishing measures are great to see and are hopeful. Ultimately, there may be some unique coping mechanisms that are being used or some unique strengths among gender minority participants in these rural spaces that support a comparable level of thriving despite reporting more stigma and poor mental health as well. That's something we really want to dig into. And lastly, we see some interesting regional variation that we're going to keep an eye on to see how it plays out in our full sample, but also relatively similar distributions in our study across rurality that we're going to keep an eye on. And I'm going to turn it over to Kirsten who is hopefully here with functional Internet. We're just re‑enacting the role, the reality of unreliable Internet. KIRSTEN SIEBACH: Yeah, sorry about that, everyone. I'm going to keep my video off to try to help the Internet. I'll be talking about our participant safety protocol. So as Mariah mentioned earlier, participant safety is a really high priority for this study given the topics that we're addressing. And we noticed that there hasn't been a lot of discussion within the research community about mental health safety protocols generally. So, we wanted to share what our protocol looks like, both for transparency purposes but also in case it might be helpful for future online research studies. The safety protocol is initiated based on survey responses to the C‑SSRS and also if the parent requests a study staff to contact them for support. Based on the C‑SSRS, if a participant answers yes to current thoughts of suicide and yes to any one of the following questions ‑‑ the intention to act, an existing plan to carry out an attempt, steps taken toward an attempt in the last three months, and an actual suicide attempt in the last three months ‑‑ an automatic email is sent to study clinicians notifying them of this participant's survey. That email includes the participant's study ID with obviously no personal information, the responses to the C‑SSRS questions and the ZIP Code of the participant so that clinicians can look up geographically relevant resources before reaching out to the participant. We also have the option for participants to opt into an outreach call in case they're feeling the stress from participation but don't meet the safety threshold from the C‑SSRS. Within one business day, clinicians reach out to the participants to conduct a safety assessment. This could be through a phone call, a text message or an email depending on the preferred contact method selected by the participant in the baseline survey. If the participant can't be reached on the first attempt, contact attempts continue once a day for up to seven business days. And thankfully this has never happened yet, but if we can't contact the participant within seven business days, we will reach out to their emergency contact for up to three business days. Again, we haven't had to do that, but that is in place in case. It's often been the case that the initial contact is made, but then clinicians and participants schedule another time to talk further about how the participant is doing. And during that call clinicians assess the level of risk and provide resources as needed. Each contact attempt of these outreach calls is documented and kept on file. So, here's an overview of how much outreach has been conducted as of August 8th, 2024. You can see on the left the follow‑up period, then next to the number of surveys that have been taken. Then you see the number of safety calls based on the C‑SSRS and how many were requests for contact. If we're looking at the safety calls based on the C‑SSRS we see that between 5.3 and 6.7% of the surveys initiate the safety protocol. If we look at the total of 157 safety calls based on the C‑SSRS. 138 of that 157 were with unique participants. So, this shows us that the calls are not with the same participants across different time points but with unique individuals. Here is some of our lessons learned in conducting this participant safety protocol. First, there's been a higher‑than‑expected awareness of and connection to mental health resources. Participants often talk about having a therapist or going to see a therapist soon, having social support in their area. And they have knowledge of and in some cases have used mental health resources such as the Trevor Project or the suicide project hotline, 988. That leads me to number two. A majority of safety calls have focused more on providing ongoing supportive contact rather than crisis work. Next, and, again, thankfully, we have not had to utilize more formal safety planning and access to lethal means. Next, participants have noted that the Internet is both a source of community, which is understandable given the reality of the population, but also that the Internet is a source of distressing news from the media. There's certainly intention there between seeking social support on the Internet but then also being exposed to potentially harmful messages. Lastly, we've been really struck by the use of creative outlets as sources of resilience and coping. Participants have talked about doing art, puzzles, Legos, graffiti, a range of artistic activities as ways of calming mental distress. I'll now turn it over to Mariah and Savannah to talk more about recruitment. SAVANNAH WINTER: Thanks so much, Kirsten. So before or as we start talking about recruitment, I just want to preface by saying that rural America is incredibly diverse, and strategies that we would use to reach, for example, Black rural Americans, 80% of whom live in the rural South, that strategy needs to be very different from how we recruit folks living in Appalachia or Hispanic, foreign‑born rural folks living in the Midwest, near meat‑packing plants, for example. I just want to acknowledge how important and nuanced these intersections of rurality, race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender, language are. And we definitely think about that and talk about that constantly in trying to revise our recruitment approaches. And these methods are definitely imperfect. But so far, looking back retrospectively, we can think about our recruitment strategies sort of in three phases. So, phase one encompassed our more traditional strategies of using online social media advertising to recruit participants. And that was more broad, national targeting because of the constraints that social media sites put on advertisers in terms of targeting. And then phase two focused on more targeted strategies that were smaller in volume and allowed us more control for this space. We primarily relied on contact lists of previous participants from other studies. And phase three involved more innovative, nontraditional strategies, specifically using dating apps in a capacity we hadn't before. So, we only had ever used dating app advertising for sexual health study recruitment, never for mental health. And then influencer marketing was a large part of phase three as well. Going into more detail here, for phase one we launched on Instagram and Reddit last November. And that was during the holiday season which definitely helped bolster the response. We started fairly small with just these two ads on Instagram. And then we did a sort of humorous meme‑type ad on Reddit. And we had huge success. During this first phase we enrolled around 600 people from December through February, and we had thousands of respondents. Some strategies that led to success were, number one, doing broad demographic and geographic targeting on Meta in particular. So, we didn't narrow our recruitment area to rural ZIP codes, for example. We didn't use keyword targeting approaches which we often do to reach queer and trans people on Meta. Number two, we ensured that CAB members were very closely involved and had seen and were able to provide feedback on all of our ad copy and creative, prior to launch. And then lastly, we ensured that comments on all of our ads were hidden throughout the recruitment period, which is something that Meta does not allow natively. But we use an external site called NapoleonCat that auto moderates and allows us to completely hide all comments automatically. It has a bunch of other features that are super helpful as well. I really recommend something like that over manual moderation, not only because of the time and effort it takes to do that manually, but also and more importantly because of the emotional burden it places on staff to have to sit there and manually sift through thousands of hate comments, transphobic, homophobic, racist comments, just the vitriol that you see on social media sometimes. Despite our success or maybe in spite of our success during this phase, the volume quickly became a bit unmanageable for us. So, we didn't foresee the response being so great. But this also came with very high rates of fraud. So, both scammers that were real people and bots and ‑‑ very committed scammers, might I add. So, folks who went so far as to sign up for a phone session with our clinicians, who spoke to clinicians and staff on the phone, giving phony responses. And so, this all led to us having to iterate and change up our fraud‑prevention processes multiple times. And it also made it so that we needed to hire additional staff to do all the validation work and the kind of manual data entry that was required for this. And then we quickly noticed that despite the large volume coming in from social media, which was filling up the nonbinary cohort very quickly, it was overwhelmingly white and trended much younger. So, we went into phase two knowing this and we also reached saturation on social media pretty quickly. So, by March, our ads were not really being shown or engaged with nearly to the same extent as when we launched. Next slide. So then that leads us to phase two, where we paused our social media campaigns, focused on solely more targeted lower volume strategies to allow us to catch our breath but to address the problems we had during phase one. We gathered participants from other studies AMIS and TWIST research truants they're annual cross‑sectional studies. AMIS for men and TWIST for transgender women's. We sent out an email for future contact and allowed us to focus on the specific cohorts where we needed to bolster numbers and also to have the peace of mind that folks from these lists had already been vetted to some extent, they were unlikely to be fraudulent. We knew that AMIS participants also tended to be older which we wanted because at this point around 90% of our REALM sample was between 18 and 36. We wanted 36‑plus and AMIS prevented help with that age discrimination. MARIAH VALENTINE‑GRAVES: As we mentioned, we had to start cultivating nontraditional strategies using data apps, which we were initially hesitant to do. Did I turn on my video? Initially hesitant to do given that this is not a sexual health survey, but rather a mental health survey. We found some very strong success with A4A, also known as Adam4Adam, which is primarily a dating/hookup site for cis men, who have sex with men. But they also do have a sizable transmasc and transfemme user base. They were very helpful in getting us not just people from across the cohorts. They were also more racially and ethnically diverse than what we were receiving on social media ‑‑ through self‑service social media advertisement, so more diverse in terms of age, which is something we very definitely need. We had less luck using Grindr, which is supposedly the premier dating and hookup app for gay men, but also, like A4A, also has a sizable trans contingent. It, unfortunately, proved to be too expensive for us to use long-term considering the somewhat anemic response rate we received. And Tinder, lastly, was extremely unsuccessful, super expensive. Tinder ‑‑ so something we've seen across the board is a lot of places do not want to provide any measures for reaching out to specific subsets of their user base. Ostensibly this is to protect against harassment, but anecdotally, from what I've heard, that doesn't necessarily turn out to be the case. It has a somewhat chilling effect on actual recruitment through those sites. So, we cannot necessarily use them. Say, Tinder, which has ‑‑ it's the number one dating site ‑‑ but we can't just try and advertise towards LGBTQ people, meaning that most of the money ends up just spread across the entire audience, which is just not really practical for the work we're doing. Next. So, we also stepped into influencer marketing. It's something that is attested to by sales marketers and things like that. But it's kind of a different audience. Your sales versus recruitment, especially recruitment of marginalized communities who have reason to be distrusting. So, it's something we have slowly worked our way into. Our first partnership was with Erin Reed, a transfemme journalist who does a lot of reporting on anti‑trans and, more broadly, anti‑LGBTQ legislation across the country. And since there is some overlap, as we've established, between rural spaces and anti‑LGBTQ legislation, we found a pretty enthusiastic response, sizable number of participants, that she managed to bring us. There were downsides. It was pretty racially/ethnically homogenous. But it kind of helped us shape our strategy moving forward, giving us an idea of what is possible with influencer marketing so long as we identify the right people on the right platforms at the right time. And their big benefit of influencers being their followers are more likely to be engaged as opposed to any random person on a social media site. They are more invested in the actual findings of the work. And they're more likely to find feedback. That's something that's super useful to us. It's just a lot of comments, emails and so forth that have really helped us address some of the shortcomings that we have in our work as it is currently ongoing. We also did find issue, as mentioned before, since it did have a disproportionately white response, we've had to implement quota‑based strategy. And it’s a pro and a con, but because the increased engagement we did get a better understanding about issues with our definition of rurality versus what the public view ‑‑ what the public view rurality as. Next, please. Some of the challenges that we've had across the board, we've had to deal with quite a bit of attempted fraud. Because it's an online survey, because it is compensated, and because ideally since we're trying to reach people, we don't want to have several barriers to access, which honestly don't even necessarily help with bots and things like that, but only really serve to inhibit the actual completion of our surveys. We've struggled a lot dealing with bad faith actors who are in it for the incentive. A lot of the measures that we have traditionally used, all the stuff that's attested to in the literature is out of date. And it gets out of date extremely quickly. With all the AI, tech and things like that hitting the ecosystem now, it's something that we constantly have to iterate upon to make sure that not only do we not just completely run out of money to advertise and recruit legitimate participants and pay them, but also just makes it bugbear in terms of keeping our ‑‑ validating, processing all these entries and making sure that the data we have is genuine, authentic and reflects the population we're actually trying to benefit. Regarding the influencer marketing, it's something that ‑‑ it's growing pains. We are not necessarily the ‑‑ we don't have all of the strategies in place, though we are developing them. So, it is good but has been difficult. We have struggled reaching Spanish speakers or at least monolingual Spanish speakers. We know there are cultural barriers we can't just broach by having an ad translated or having the survey translated. We looked to the literature for suggestions on this as well as reaching out to members of not just this community advisory board but Spanish speakers elsewhere and tried to see if we could identify those. But we have had trouble addressing intersecting marginalizations of potentially monolingual Spanish speakers who live in rural areas who may or may not be alienated from the broader community. We also ran ads in Puerto Rico, but we found that participants often just opted to take the surveys in English. And pardon me, something ‑‑ so something I mentioned before, we had issues with regards to our measure of rurality versus what we have heard from participants. We're using the NCHS Urban Rural Classification Scheme which bases it off of core ‑‑ just totally lost the word ‑‑ core population areas. And that leads to cases where people who live in ostensibly rural areas fall through the cracks and raises the question to us, how do we recruit without misleading and how do we make sure we're reaching who we're trying to reach. And the last issue we've had, especially with regards to traditional social media, recruitment is getting exceedingly difficult, especially in an election year, to advertise any SGM, LGBTQ topics without it being immediately shut down, blocked for being political content, which is frustrating and something that is hard to work out with them at times. SHOSHANNA FINE: In terms of our current recruitment phase, we're continuing to try to innovate and use nontraditional strategies. We are prioritizing increasing numbers in specific cohorts where we are lacking in numbers. And, so, specifically that's our transmasc and cis female cohorts. And we're also prioritizing increasing racial and ethnic diversity across all of our cohorts. With these goals in mind, we have partnered with the Association for Rural & Small Libraries which is a CAB suggestion. ARSL is a network of rural librarians and library workers. They have about 3,000 members and a larger network of around 8,000. And they also have an LGBTQ networking group. So, we worked with them to create a set of flyers that can be posted in computer labs or physical spaces in libraries, as well as could be sent out electronically. We hope that will increase access for folks who aren't seeing our advertisements online. And second, we want to prioritize outreach to monolingual Spanish speakers, as Savannah mentioned, and Hispanic participants more generally, which has definitely been more challenging than anticipated. And likely this is because recruitment strategies we would normally use to recruit Hispanic and Latino participants generally don't work for those living in rural areas. We can't just run statewide campaigns in California or Florida because these states are overwhelmingly metropolitan, for example. So, we really have to shift our idea of prioritizing the West and Southwest and instead look at where rural Hispanic folks are geographically, which is increasingly clustered around meat‑packing and poultry industries in the South and Midwest, places like North Georgia or Ford and Finney County in Kansas. And we're looking into partnering with migrant farm workers associations, Black and Hispanic churches in the South and art collectives, among other things. And then, third, we're considering partnering with additional influencers, but we want to be intentional about recruiting participants that we need the most and that are the most diverse. And so, one challenging aspect of influencer partnerships is that an influencer being of a particular demographic doesn't necessarily mean that their audience is of that demographic. This just complicates the process a bit. But it really just means that we need to be really intentional about who we're partnering with and who their audience is. Lastly, we're constantly evaluating and revising our recruitment procedures to respond to this ever‑changing landscape online. And so, for better or worse online recruitment is, it now really requires an ongoing iterative approach with robust fraud‑prevention strategies that are implemented by actively engaged human staff. And I say that because a lot of this, in our experience, can't really be automated and it requires a great deal of manual human attention. SARAH MURRAY: Because of the time I want to move us into Q&A. I just want to say we're finishing our baseline recruitment this year. We're diving into all of our analyses and our discrete choice experiment design. And we're going to be looking more and more through this study at structural stigma and mental health and tell those shapes experiences for our participants. Okay, with that, we just want to thank you all for your time and attention and thank the Office for Disparities Research and Workforce Diversity and Dr. Davis and others for the opportunity to present today, as well as our CAB, people that have been instrumental in getting this study going, and most importantly all of our participants whose time and effort we really hope to honor through taking this work and turning it into public health action. I'm going to stop sharing. SHAUN DAVIS: That's totally okay. And just to be mindful of the fact that we have a little bit of time for an abridged Q&A. We have extended it a little bit. We can extend it to 3:05, I think, per our contract. So, we'll have a few more moments to discuss some of the questions that were presented in the chat. And there are a lot of really good questions that will lead to really good discussion. So, I'd like to invite all of the presenters to turn on your cameras if you would like, based off of broadband and all of that, and we can go ahead and discuss some of these questions. First off, there are a lot of suggestions in the chat, in the comments, about how to recruit in places that might be really helpful. I just want to assure everyone that we have those, and we will share them with the team. I can't address all the "did they recruit here; did they recruit there," right now because of time. But you'll have access to the resources. And I like to think of this as a great idea. We're all a community of practice and research and resources, and so it's really great you all shared that. I think there's a lot of really good suggestions in chat about places you may or may not be recruiting. Yes, I'll slow down. I'm talking a little fast because I'm a little caffeinated. My bad. To start, one question that was asked that is a simple one, is there a way we can share to invite potential participants. Are there links or websites that would be helpful for the subsets of people that you're looking to recruit? >> Yes, definitely. I don't know the best way, but, yes, we have QR Codes, we have a link, we have flyers ‑‑ however it's easiest to share. SHAUN DAVIS: Could you put the link in the chat? And I think we can have the event host share that for everyone broadly. Because I think we can't share it. They have to be the ones to share. >> Sarah, I'm assuming you're comfortable with that. That's fine? SAVANNAH WINTER: Okay. >> Thanks, Savannah. SHAUN DAVIS: All right, the next question gets into this idea by fraudulent responses. And that's something that you've talked extensively about. One thing that was asked is have you been thinking about publishing some of those experiences, like sussing out who is fraudulent, who is not, who is truly of the sample you want to recruit. Could you talk more about that? MARIAH VALENTINE‑GRAVES: We've submitted two abstracts. Savannah wrote one and I wrote one. And they were both rejected. So, we are working on it, but as this process goes, you know. But, yeah, we definitely ‑‑ we have documented formally all of our procedures and definitely will continue trying to publish. Savannah, I don't know if you want to add anything. SAVANNAH WINTER: I think you covered it. It's just something that we have kind of had to come to terms with, and it's a constant process. SHAUN DAVIS: That makes a lot of sense. I think just hearing about the recruitment procedures, I think this is a unique challenge based off the nature of the work that you're doing that I think many folks could learn from. Especially with recruiting in the social media landscape, which is ever changing, as you already mentioned. I think that's something that the field definitely would be responsive to in some way. All right. For the sake of time, I'll move on to the next question. There were a few questions about sort of racialized identities and how that might intersect with rural identity. So how do you think about sort of some of the risk and protective factors for suicidality and depression for those with racialized identities? SARAH MURRAY: I think that's such a great question. I think one of the myths that we hope to really dispel for our work is this idea that rurality means white or means homogenous, which is just not the case. Rural areas are increasingly diverse. This is something that we hope to look at through some really stratified analyses as we go through and really trying to take a more of an intersectional lens. It's also why we have some measures in our data that don't just ask about stigma and discrimination experience because of your gender identity or because of your sexual orientation but because of who you are, which we can recognize can encompass a wide variety of things, including race/ethnicity, including your immigration status, including the fact you're from a rural area, depending on where you're living. And it is something that we really ‑‑ it's why we're really striving to increase the diversity of our sample, to be consistent with the rural population and actually exceed it so we can actually do some more stratified analyses. And we also ‑‑ I really appreciate the comments about the diversity or the lack of diversity of our panel in terms of race/ethnicity. It's something we strive to have in our team. It's a well‑taken point about us being on this presentation today. But it is something we strive and value on our team, on our CAB, and that we really hope to use the study as an opportunity to keep people bringing in of a wide variety of backgrounds into this research processes because it makes the research better. And we want this to be reflective of the wide variety of experiences that we know exist. So, we appreciate the point. It's well taken. SHAUN DAVIS: The office that I'm in also talks about research work, and it's a huge area. I think that we're trying to make efforts to increase the diversity of the workforce, in particular within the SGM research workforce. But we're still in the early stages and we're doing our best at this time, right? So, speaking of sort of stratifying analysis, there were some other questions about how rurality is not homogenous. Like, Appalachia might look different from the Midwest, from the Deep South, all of that. How do you think about some of those subgroup analyses? Like, is that on the horizon for you as well? Could you tell us a little bit more about that? SARAH MURRAY: Yes. So, we're hoping to really have the ability to look within region and look specifically within region as we really do recognize that point. We also really want to look ‑‑ and I didn't get to talk about this too much, but actually led by Kirsten as a part of her doctoral work ‑‑ will really also be thinking about heterogeneity in terms of policy environment across rural areas. And that might be region‑specific, but that also might be sort of some places having more protective policies. Some having much more harmful policies in place and really thinking how that is shaping experiences in diverse ways and really recognizing that really important heterogeneity. And so that is work that we'll be engaging in, led by Kirsten. And I'm sure she'll be happy to tell you more about it. SHAUN DAVIS: Certainly. Kirsten, do you want to comment on that? Any other thoughts you want to add to that. KIRSTEN SIEBACH: Yeah, I can talk a little about my research, looking at structural stigma, looking at the policy environment, both kind of legislatively, but I'm also planning as part of my research to actually go and interview folks living in the rural U.S. to kind of understand how their policy environments really impact their mental health, how they think about kind of their identities, their intersecting identities, including rurality, and how they experience those intersecting identities in this place geographically. It's still in the works. I haven't started quite yet but hoping to get underway soon. But, yeah, I'm very excited to undertake this kind of important area of research. SHAUN DAVIS: That's wonderful. Maybe we can invite to you the next webinar, and you'll be the one presenting on your research. That would be so exciting. All right. So, a couple of other questions came up around trust for sort of LGBTQ+ rural folks. How do we ‑‑ how are you all thinking about trust in terms of trusting institutions? Just how do you think about that, in terms of getting people to engage when there's a history of mistrust for valid reasons, of course? And how did that factor into how you think about recruitment? MARIAH VALENTINE‑GRAVES: We think about it and talk about it constantly. We respond certainly to feedback from participants that express that. And then we try and address it either by having set language that we send, communicating certain things by email usually or automated responses on social media. But we also ‑‑ we've done things like create an FAQ document that can be embedded on our landing page of our survey that talks about ‑‑ a big thing is data protection and confidentiality related to that. And, so, having language there for folks that they can refer to and we can refer to is often helpful. Also, we've also had discussions about whether or not it's helpful to have the Emory and JHU logos on our ads, or if that's a deterrent for some folks. Actually, I think we've done A/B testing to try both to see what the response was. We're always trying to iterate on this and respond to folks' concerns. Savannah, did I miss anything? I'm sure I did. SAVANNAH WINTER: No, I think you did good. It's just making sure that we, I think, just being earnest, being honest and acknowledging. I think a big thing is acknowledging that people's concerns are legitimate because considering who we are, who we represent, so on and so forth, there are general harms that have been perpetrated. And it's something that we have to work with our communities to work past and be, I guess, be humble around that fact. MARIAH VALENTINE‑GRAVES: And we're asking participants to be very vulnerable. And they've divulged a lot of information to us, and they don't know us. So just acknowledging that their concerns are legitimate. And communicating, I think working with influencers, we've seen that sometimes one person's comment about distrust can really blow up into something big. And so just communicating with folks often will quell some of the concerns. People's kind of fear or anger is really just about not having all of the information. Oftentimes when we provide information and communicate with them, then they feel like, okay, this is a real person I'm talking to, and it alleviates some of it. But it's imperfect. SHOSHANNA FINE: I know we're running short on time, but if I could jump in briefly on a related comment to trust. I think actually one thing that I think is worth mentioning here, we weren't sure how recruitment would go for this study. Our team has a lot of experience reaching SGM folks but not a lot of experience reaching SGM folks in rural areas, specifically in a study focused on mental health. I'd say one of the things that's been amazing in this study and in our recruitment, efforts are actually the level of interest we've found from people in participating. I think we've had a huge response to the study. I think it goes along with trust, but it's a testament to the fact that there hasn't been a lot of research traditionally done with these communities. And there hasn't been a lot of opportunity for folks to have their voices heard within these types of studies. And so, I think we have to be sure, obviously, to establish trust. But I also think the flipside of that is people are really interested in sharing and being a part of something like this. SHAUN DAVIS: For so long, we talked about how rural communities have not, rural LGBTQ folks have not been included in research. I can see how there might be a lot of sorts of interest ‑‑ like, you all want to hear from me now, right? It probably feels good to be represented and have folks take an interest in their studies. All right. For the sake of time, I'll wrap up with the last question about flourishing and the resilience factor and protective factors you all talked about. Could you talk a little bit more about sort of things that might have surprised you with the flourishing findings, or just the flourishing findings in general? I think there's a lot of really interesting sort of gems in that section of the presentation. SARAH MURRAY: This is one of the places that we were most excited to dive into. I think we sometimes have this idea that these things are fully in contrast to one another, that mental distress and flourishing are, like, two ends of the same spectrum, but that people can experience distrust and actually flourish in different domains of life. And I think, to be honest, when we proposed these aims and we sat down and we looked at our measures as we started to get ready for this study, we kind of had this moment as a team where we were, like, whoa, this is so negative, and risk focused. And of course, it is really important that we understand risk, but we did not feel good about putting a survey out there for people to answer ‑‑ and putting results out there (indiscernible) study that also didn't consider unique strengths and positive mental health outcomes. And so, this is something that we don't see as much in the literature, not to say that it's not there. But it's not currently seen as much as ‑‑ and can people be experiencing a lot of risk but still flourishing? And, if so, sort of what is happening there? How is that happening? What are the strengths that people are relying on? What is the sort of unique resources. And because our goal is ultimately to go through these discrete choice experiments and really develop support, some kind of mobile or sort of app‑based support, we really wanted to understand how to build upon those strengths and promote those strengths. And ultimately the outcome we want isn't just the lack of distress. Like, of course, we'd like to ameliorate distress. We'd like to keep people safe, but we want more than that. We want people to flourish. We want people to thrive. We want to support people in that. And that requires a bit of a broader perspective. So, seeing those numbers coming back in has been so encouraging, I think, and reinforcing of that. And I would like to encourage others to do that as well because I think we'll be continually surprised by what we find. SHAUN DAVIS: Mariah, were you going to say something else? MARIAH VALENTINE‑GRAVES: Could I rapid fire two responses? You all have the best questions, and I want to respond to all of them. SHAUN DAVIS: Before you do that, just want to say we just pasted a link in the chat for the next webinar in the series. I know we're about to wrap up. I just want folks to see that. It's coming up. Sorry, go ahead, Mariah. MARIAH VALENTINE‑GRAVES: I've seen a few questions about specifically recruiting Asian Americans in rural areas. Great question. And we actually haven't needed to do that yet because the recruitment methods that we've been using have brought in ‑‑ around 4% of our current sample identifies Asian, Native Hawaiian or another Pacific Islander. And that's compared to around 1% of what the census says is the Asian American rural population. We've been sort of more diverse in that area than we anticipated. And so, for that reason we haven't done specific outreach to that community. But it is super important and we're definitely looking at that. And then the other question I saw was about neurodiversity, I think, and disability and whether we've looked at those intersections in relation to our research. We definitely have. We've had discussions about that. And we've had comments from participants as well about whether or not we're studying that. But also, we've had people respond with certain gender identities that are kind of neurodivergent/queer identities, so how to talk about classify that, like birdgender, which is a zerogender that's neurodivergent, and those types of things. So, yeah, we've definitely seen comments and we've talked about it as a team. And I don't think it's in this research plan, but it may be for the future. I'm not sure. SHAUN DAVIS: Thank you for attacking those questions rapid fire. Because I was, like, there's so much that we could get to, and we could probably have an hour‑long Q&A truthfully with some of the questions in the chat. I appreciate you addressing those really briefly. With that, we are at time. So I really just want to thank you all for presenting today on this really sort of important work that you're doing and all the sort of challenges that are associated with it because I think there's so much that people can learn from all the lessons that you've learned along the way about how to recruit the sample and to really give voice to rural LGBTQ communities and their needs. So, thank you so much. And also thank you everyone for attending and being so active in the Q&A. I know there's some questions we didn't get to, but hopefully we can have more discussions like this in the future. So, thank you all so much. And with that, we will wrap up. Have a wonderful day. SAVANNAH WINTER: Thanks for having us. SARAH MURRAY: Thank you, everybody, and have a great day.

> Office for Disparities Research and Workforce Diversity Webinar Series: Advancing Methods and Measures to Examine the Underlying Mechanisms of Violent Deaths in LGBTQ Populations Transcript TAMARA LEWIS JOHNSON: Good afternoon and welcome to the 2022 National Institute of Mental Health LGBTQ Mental Health Lecture. My name is Tamara Lewis Johnson, and I am the chief of the Women’s Mental Health Research Program at the Office for Disparities Research and Workforce Diversity at the NIMH. The purpose of the webinar series is to spotlight research on mental health disparities, women’s mental health, minority mental health, and rural mental health. This afternoon we are spotlighting the research of Drs. Cochran, Arseniev-Koehler, Foster, Chang, and Mays. This research was funded by the NIMH’s Division of Services and Intervention Research. Now, I will say a little bit about the topic. Due to multiple minority stressors, LGBTQ individuals are at increased risk for suicide and violent death. Health research literature suggests that LGBTQ people are more likely to die by violent death than their non-LGBTQ peers. But because sexual orientation and gender identity data are not systematically collected at the time of death, actual mortality to disparities and the context of these deaths are not well known. This research fills a gap in LGBTQ research and will transform the status of mortality data collection to better identify sexual orientation/gender identity data, which facilitates studies to guide prevention and intervention research around preventable deaths among LGBTQ populations. The researchers will discuss their efforts to measure sexual orientation/gender identity using postmortem data when there is a violent death among LGBTQ individuals and ways to improve surveillance and electronic medical record systems for sexual orientation/gender identity collection, use, and quality. In addition, they will present findings on data, using the National Violent Death Reporting System to better understand the violent deaths among LGBTQ individuals and methods for increasing the ability to identify sexual orientation/gender identity after a violent death has occurred. Together these researchers present evidence-based data, analytical techniques that demonstrate the need for better usability of mortality data of LGBTQ populations. Now, I will introduce the speakers. The first is Dr. Susan Cochran. She is the professor of the Department of Epidemiology at UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and the Department of Statistics. By training, she is both a clinical psychologist and a social epidemiologist. Her research interests focus on the psycho-social determinants of health and health-related behaviors and the role of social stigma and discrimination in health care access, health behaviors, mental health, and health outcomes. With funding from NIMH over the years, she has investigated patterns of sexual risk taking related to HIV infection control, the burden of mental health and substance use disorders among sexual and racial and ethnic minorities and serves as a principal investigator of the California Quality of Life Survey, a statewide population-based study of mental health over time among sexual minorities and heterosexuals. Dr. Cochran will take questions immediately following the presentation. All other questions will be held for the end of the panel of all the speakers. Dr. Cochran will be followed by Dr. Arseniev-Koehler and Dr. Jacob Foster. Dr. Arseniev-Koehler is a computational and cultural sociologist with substantive interests in health, language, and social categories. Her research aims to clarify core concepts and debates about shared meanings, such as stereotypes. Empirically, she focuses on cases linked to health and inequality such as the moral meanings attached to body weight, the stigmatizing meanings of disease, and gender stereotypes. To investigate these topics, she uses computational methods and machine learning, especially computational text analysis. Dr. Jacob Foster is a computational sociologist interested in the social production of collective intelligence, the evolutionary dynamics of ideas, and the co-construction of culture and cognition. His empirical work blends computational methods with qualitative insights from science studies to probe the strategies, dispositions, and social processes that shape the production and persistence of scientific and technological ideas. He uses machine learning to mine the cultural meanings buried in text, and computational methods from macro-evolution to understand the dynamics of cultural populations. Dr. Foster also develops formal models of the structure and dynamics of ideas and institutions, with an emerging theoretical and empirical focus on the rich nexus of cognition, culture, and computation. Dr. Chang is an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science at UCLA. He leads a natural language processing group. His research includes designing robust machine-learning methods for large and complex data and building fair and accountable language-processing technologies for social-good applications. Dr. Chang has published more than 120 papers in machine learning, artificial intelligence and natural language processing. Dr. Vickie Mays will close out the panel. She is the distinguished professor in the Department of Psychology in the College of Letters and Sciences and Healthy Policy and Management at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, a senior fellow in mental health at the UCLA California Health Policy Research Center. She is originally trained as a clinical psychologist as well as a professor at the UCLA School of Public Health. She has served for 15 years as a NIH P60 center director on minority health disparities. Her research program in mental and physical health disparities among racial and ethnical and sexual minorities has a particular emphasis on identifying various statuses associated with these disparities, intersect to produce specific and sometimes unique pathways for negative mental and physical health outcomes. Two current two foci of her work are in big data and COVID-19. Her NIMH-funded work focuses on the development of artificial intelligence methods for the classification of race, ethnicity, and social orientation and big data on suicides and homicides. She is funded to develop a predictive model of health equity for the mitigation of COVID, specifically for the black population, focused on the identification of social vulnerabilities. She has served on a number of NIH National Academies for Engineering, Sciences, and Medicine, federal, state, and local board committees. She currently is a congressional appointee to the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics where she serves as the co-chair of the workgroup to assess SOGI, sexual orientation and gender identity, and structural determinants of health data measures, definitions, collections, use, and protection. And now, we will go to some housekeeping. These are our housekeeping notes. Participants who have entered are on mute or in listen-only mode. Your Cameras have been disabled. Participants may submit questions via the Q&A box and at any time during the webinar, please address your question to the intended speaker. Questions will be answered towards the end of the webinar during the Q&A session with the exception of Dr. Cochran’s presentation, which is the first one. If you have technical difficulties hearing or viewing the webinar, please note these in the Q&A box and our technicians will work to fix the problem. You can also send an email to the email on the screen. All webinars in this series are being recorded and will be made available in the coming weeks. CEUs and certificates of attendance are not being offered for this webinar/lecture. With no further ado, I will have Dr. Susan Cochran take it away. SUSAN D. COCHRAN: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to this seminar. I am going to be speaking first in the series to kind of set the framework for the work that we have been doing at UCLA and so in this talk, what I would like to do is spend some time talking about why we submitted an R21 to do this work and spend some time also talking about the challenges of using the database that we decided to use, which is the National Violent Death Reporting System, NVDRS, some of the early attempts that have been made by others to use this database, and then share with you some of our preliminary findings for work that we are still working on. It is sometimes hard to realize that the measurement of sexual orientation in health data is a relatively new phenomenon that following the onset of HIV epidemic, the measurement of sexual orientation started to appear inside of different health data systems and here in this slide, I am showing the appearance date of these measurements. One of the effects of including these measurements in health data was to revolutionize the field of the study of sexual orientation and health. Sorry I am having difficulties with my mouse. Before the inclusion of these measures, we knew that there were high rates of suicide related morbidity in LGBT populations. But we could not compare those results to other populations to see whether or not they were higher or lower. We just knew they were high. And what happened when sexual orientation was included as a variable in regular health data sets was that for the first time, we could compare these high rates of suicide morbidity that we were seeing with comparison groups and so over time, we were able to demonstrate without any doubt that there were much higher rates of suicide ideation, suicide attempts. It did not matter which population you were looking at, young people, older people, men, women. It did not matter whether you were talking about suicide ideation in the last year or lifetime. There just was this much higher rate of suicide morbidity in the population. That effect remains today and so even though there has been quite a bit of social change that has occurred in the last 35 years since we started being able to measure this effect, it is also true that this effect has not waned. This effect has not disappeared even though social change has led to more rights for LGB individuals. It has led to more discussion. There are more people who are out. They are able to come out at work. There are all sorts of ways in which life has changed dramatically for sexual minorities in the United States. But we still see this higher rate of suicide attempts particularly among younger individuals. Whether this higher rate of suicide attempts is also matched by a higher rate of suicide mortality, it is difficult to determine within the United States health data systems. There is evidence from Europe where they have different data systems that the rate of suicide mortality is higher among sexual minorities. There is also some emerging evidence from Canada where they have a different data system that there is somewhat higher rates of suicide. But here in the United States, we are hampered in being able to determine whether or not there are higher rates of suicide simply because our data sets are just not set up to determine that. We do not measure sexual orientation in the death certificate. We cannot tell from a death certificate whether a person might be gay or bisexual or heterosexual or whatever. We have trouble linking data from our health data where we do have those measurements into our mortality statistics for a number of different reasons. Given this problem of trying to figure out is there a higher rate or not of mortality, our group started thinking about is there a data set out there that we can use that will allow us to answer this question of whether or not there are higher rates of suicide mortality in this population. That led to this R21 application moonshot that we submitted. We said we are going to take the National Violent Death Reporting System database, which is an administrative database. We knew that database was large. That is what you need to be able to do this kind of research. We also knew that the database had begun to measure sexual orientation and transgender identity of the victims whose cases are reported inside this database. But we also knew that it was incomplete. That even though the database had begun in 2003 that the inclusion of this measurement only started to come into the database around 2012. We had the idea that we could take the narratives that are in this database and use the narratives to determine sexual orientation of all those cases that had not yet been coded. That was the plan behind the R21. That was what we applied for when we submitted our application to NIMH. We were fortunate that NIMH review panels saw the value of that work and we were funded to begin this work. Now that we were funded, we actually sat down with the database and we started trying to think about how can we make use of this administrative database to determine sexual orientation of the now more than 400,000 victims whose cases are reported inside this database. That led us to all the challenges that exist in the NVDRS. Let me spend a few minutes just talking about what is the NVDRS. This is a database that was begun in 2002 by the Centers for Disease Control. Gradually over time, different state health departments have come into this database and as of now, all 50 states and Puerto Rico are included inside this database. And what happens is that at the state level, public health workers take information about a death that has been classified as a violent death, which is a death that is by suicide, by homicide, or by some sort of unintentional injury that happens to the person. Most of the deaths in the database are suicides or homicides. The public health worker –so there are hundreds of public health workers who are doing this work – follows a CDC coding manual and they fill out the information in the coding sheet. And this coding sheet is then transmitted electronically to the Centers for Disease Control and the case is included in the database. The form that they are filling out – they fill it out using information that they have available at the time. They have information from the medical examiner. They have information from the law enforcement reports. They have the death certificate. They might have toxicology reports. They even can sometimes look at other information that we do not have available on our end. They might be able to look at social media or newspaper reports about the death. And then from this information, they fill out the form and they also write two narratives about what happened with the death, who the person was who died and perhaps some of the things that were going on at the time around when they died. Before I go to the next slide, I wanted to put a triggering notice in this slide because some of the things that I am going to show might be upsetting and some of the later presentations also might have some upsetting information in the slide. I just wanted to pause for a moment, let you all take a breath. We are talking about violent death here. There may be some things that you might want to pause the presentation and then come back to it to listen to. What I show here is a couple of examples of these death narratives. These are not actual death narratives. These are death narratives honestly that I wrote because this is a restricted data set with the CDC. When you obtain the data set, you agree that you are not going to disclose this information because of privacy for the people who are left behind by these victims. This narrative shows you that typically they follow a similar format. They are brief. They describe the person. They describe some of the events that are going on around the person. There can be up to two narratives for each death. In the NVDRS, the sexual orientation classification is a very rare event actually. In this slide, I show you that most cases in the NVDRS have unknown classification of sexual orientation. The reason for this unknown classification of sexual orientation is because of the instruction to the coder. The public health coder can only code this information if in fact sexual orientation is mentioned in the narrative. And if it is not mentioned in the narrative, they are not allowed to code the data. That is one of the reasons why so many cases are missing. The other thing to recognize about the NVDRS is that this is a very different measurement of sexual orientation. It is not a person’s individual identity. But it is a phenotypic assessment of the individual. It is what people around that individual at the time of their death say about them and whether or not their death happens in the context of something related to sexual orientation or transgender identity. And then finally, the last thing I want to mention is that base rate really matters here. You can have an algorithm that perfectly predicts. But if you have a very rare event you are trying to predict to, you are going to have problems in accuracy. There have been a couple of studies that have tried to use this database with some success. One was Ream, who chose to just say I am going to use the classified data and look at differences. Those are very few cases in the database and there is a very strong assumption here that all the ones that are missing are missing at random, which they probably are not. Another study came out of our group, which was done by Kirsty Clark. And what she did was she searched. She used qualitative methods to search the database for indicators of sexual orientation and transgender status. Then she went back through the narratives that were identified and had readers read them and come up with a very good classification of whether or not there was a minority sexual orientation mentioned in the database and whether or not bullying occurred. She was able to show that bullying is a very strong component of suicides where people are LGBTQ in the NVDRS. And then finally, I just wanted to share with you some of the work that we have been doing, which is that we have been trying to use information that is in the database and in the narratives to try to predict to sexual orientation status. We have a couple of gold standards in the database. We have the actual coding for LGBT status. We have information from the CDC on a study that they did where they coded for LGBT status. And then we had these markers that we have developed by going through the narratives, trying to code information that we think might be indicative of sexual orientation, including terms related to sexual orientation and also the nature of the relationships that people are in whether they are the same or different gender, whether or not HIV is mentioned or whether or not a family member is mentioned in the narrative. From this, we have been able to do a pretty good job of predicting what the sexual orientation is of the victim in the death record. We are still not at a level where we are ready to report it. We think we are there, but we are still tweaking some things, trying to come up with some better solutions. And in the process of doing this work, we realize that we needed to take a step back and think about these narratives in a slightly different way. We needed to expand our team and bring on experts in some other fields. In the next talks, what you are going to hear is from some of the people who we started to bring into our team to be able to think about these narratives in a slightly different way than what we have been thinking about. I am going to stop here and pass it on to the next speaker, who is Alina. TAMARA LEWIS JOHNSON: Actually, Dr. Cochran, I am going to step in just for a minute. We do have a question from the audience for you, Dr. Cochran. Do you want to turn your camera back on? The question is why is having a mother or brother in the narrative potentially indicative of LBGTQ identity? SUSAN D. COCHRAN: Well, it is actually potentially indicative of heterosexual identity. One of the ways to think about what we are trying to do here is we are trying to predict the sexual orientation or the transgender status of the case whether it be LGBTQ or whether it be heterosexual. It turns out that it is predictive of being heterosexual to have kin, family members, children, brothers, sisters, aunts, and uncles described inside the narrative. TAMARA LEWIS JOHNSON: Thank you very much. And then I have one other question. What factors do you suggest researchers consider to improve gathering sexual orientation/gender identity characteristics from the National Violent Death Reporting System? SUSAN D. COCHRAN: I think that question might be better answered at the end of the presentation by Dr. Mays. TAMARA LEWIS JOHNSON: Here is one more. Why is a mention of HIV/AIDS being used as a potential indicator for sexual and/or gender minority status? This may feel incredibly stigmatizing. SUSAN D. COCHRAN: One of the problems with not using HIV is that you are looking – you are deciding I am not going to look at information in a database that will help me to identify a population when that population we know is likely to have higher rates of HIV infection than other populations. It is not a question of stigmatizing a group. It is actually important to measure it. When we first started measuring sexual orientation in health surveys, this concern about ‘you are going to stigmatize people by asking them what their sexual orientation’ was used as a reason not to measure sexual orientation. If we had not measured sexual orientation, we would not know today that sexual orientation is associated with higher rates of suicide. We just would not know what we know. One of the things that we have to think about in the field is that we can worry about whether something is stigmatizing or not or we can use a correlation that we see is there to find out something. To my mind, it is important that we know. It is much more important that we know the health risks that are in our community. We are not saying by using it that everyone who has HIV is gay. But I do know in the database that most of the people who have HIV infection or AIDS is mentioned in the narrative are gay men. I know from reading the database, from reading the narrative. Ignoring that information because of some concern that you are stigmatizing a population I think is honestly – does a disservice to the community. I am just going to say that. I think if we had another measure that said that all gay people are over 7 feet tall, I would certainly use that to try and identify cases in the database. This is I think the difference between using what you have and wishing it is something else. I am just going to say that. I know politically that may not be a positive way of saying it. This is, for example, why we are using this measure of kins being mentioned in the database. We have discovered that the mentioning of uncles and aunts is a predictor of heterosexuality. It is not a statement about heterosexuality. It is just a co-occurrence that we observe, and we are going to use it. TAMARA LEWIS JOHNSON: Thank you so much for responding to those two questions, Dr. Cochran, and for your talk this afternoon. We are going to proceed on with the next speaker who is Dr. Arseniev-Kohler. Take it away. ALINA ARSENIEV-KOEHLER: Thank you. My name is Alina Arseniev-Kohler. This part of the presentation will go back and forth between myself and Professor Foster. One of the big points I want to make is that these narratives and the NVDRS exemplifies some of the promises and challenges of working with text data more generally. Text data is something that is all around us. It is very prevalent. We see it in things like social media, in the NVDRS, in other surveillance systems and electronic health records. It is not the kind of data that we can just ignore. It also has some different information that might occur in structure data. We saw that with sexual orientation, and this also occurs in many other formats as well. At the same time, text data is very difficult to work with and we will see that with the NVDRS. Even just summarizing a large set of narratives like the NVDRS is very difficult. There are lots of ambiguity. Words can have multiple meanings. It might be very domain specific, so you have things like abbreviations. You have typos that might be messy. That might be okay for a human reader. But it is a lot more challenging when we are trying to offload some of this work to a computer, which we have to do when we have things like hundreds of thousands of narratives in the case of the NVDRS. For these reasons, text data often goes under utilized and that includes these hundreds of thousands of narratives in the NVDRS. We have this case of a broader methodological problem, which is how do we wrangle this information in a way that is scalable. Generally, you can think of this massive haystack of data, and we want to try to at least to start we want to summarize it and pick out some of the important needles or patterns going on in this haystack. This is one of the core challenges that we have focused on in getting to know these narratives and that we will talk a little bit about today. In general, one of the core solutions to summarizing a large haystack of data like the NVDRS and computational text analysis is an approach called topic modeling. The basic idea of topic modeling is this way to get to know a large data set. It asks two questions. One, what are the basic building blocks or themes or topics that are comprising this large data set? Two, how is each specific text like each narrative drawing on these building blocks? What topics are involved in a given narrative? Topic modeling is very useful because it is scalable so you can use it with data sizes that are really big or medium size. It also is inductive, meaning we do not need to read through the hundreds of thousands of narratives to be able to get out these topics. We do not need to know ahead of time what are the important topics across these hundreds of thousands of narratives or whatever text data we are working with. I am showing you here a table on the right, which is topic modeling applied to another data set called the Malawi journals project just to show you a case where topic modeling worked really well. This data is a set of journals that are collected by participants in Malawi from 1999 to 2012. They were asked to document conversations around them about HIV/AIDS. This was a supplement to a quantitative survey, which the researchers were frustrated by because they felt like they were not getting some of the information they wanted. The result was like a thousand notebooks, each of 7000 words. It is a lot of text data and that means it is too much again for one or even a handful of humans to go through and read and summarize and get a sense of what this data is trying to tell us. When they applied topic modeling, they were able to get out a series of topics that summarizes data. I am showing this table of topics so each row here is a topic. And what the computer actually spits out for a given topic is in this blue box – it is a list of words or terms or phrases, which are the most representative words for that topic. It is a way for you to get a sense of what this topic is about. Once you see this list of terms, you can then interpret the terms or look at the documents that have the highest loading of this topic and perhaps add a description like they did in this table. Perhaps you also instead of calling it topic number 3, you give it a label like in this case. They call this particular topic condoms. A little bit more specifically, topic modeling and there are lots of different approaches, but in general, what it gives you is two different products. You can think of these as two different data frames. First, we get on the left this blue matrix or data frame and what this is showing you is the loading of each word in the vocabulary on each of your topics. You can think of topics kind of like when we do factor analysis. Out of all the different ways that words are co-occurring in the corpus, you are trying to extract these latent groups of words that tend to co-occur and have these grouped patterns. You can think of topics kind of like what we are doing with factor analysis where you are pulling out factors. From this blue matrix, we can then pull out the – We can identify which topics are characterized by which words because we just look at the words with the highest loadings on a given topic. And you also get this purple matrix or data frame on the right. Here, we have each row in the matrix or data frame is a document such as an NVDRS narrative. And then a column here is the loading of that narrative on each of your topics. Again, you can characterize a given narrative by which of the topics it has the most of or look at the distribution or profile of a document based on its different topics. And then moving back to the Malawi journals project, we can now think of this as a structured variable. We went from unstructured text data to having these topics that are characterized in the documents and we can use them like any other structured variable. This is when things start to get really cool because we can start to look at things across covariates like time in this case. What you are seeing here is the prevalence across time from 1999 to 2012 of two different topics, one about dying and AIDS and another about antiretrovirals and health. You can see that at first, the topic about dying of AIDS was very prevalent. It kind of petered off. Meanwhile this topic of antiretrovirals and health was slowly increasing in prevalence. The problem is that these traditional topic models, which are kind of our key tool to summarize large-scale text data, did not actually work so well on the NVDRS narratives. I am showing you here in this table some of the topics that we got out when we first tried these traditional topic models. They are okay. You can see that these most representative terms. They look fine. It is not like they do not make any sense but they were not very useful. They are not telling us much more than we get from the hundreds of structured variables already there. Some of the possible reasons could be because this is really specific language. It is not like general English. There are typos. The document lengths are all over the place. That could be some of the reasons the topic modeling did not work well in the NVDRS. But those are characteristics that a lot of different data sets have, not just the NVDRS. If topic modeling did not work well, there is probably a large amount of data out there that topic modeling also does not work well on. That led us to go back to thinking about basic science and methods and develop a new approach to model topics or summarize large data, including the NVDRS but learning lessons that will apply well beyond NVDRS. And this model that we developed is called the discourse atom topic model. The novelty here is that compared to other approaches to model topics, we integrate another key text analysis approach called word embedding, which we will explain next. But the result and the big picture is that we still get these two outputted data frames, which structure this text information for us. Each topic is still interpreted by the most representative words. And each document is still characterized as a mix of topics. Now, I will turn it over to Professor Foster, who will explain a little bit more about this other key approach. JACOB G. FOSTER: As Alina mentioned, the other critical ingredient of our new approach is this method called word embedding. Word embedding describes a set of techniques that solves a critical problem, which is how do you represent human language on a computer. Fundamentally, computers work with numbers or with things built out of numbers. You could, for example, just assign a distinct number to each word. You could say the word hello. It will get the number 172. The problem with this approach is that the sort of things that it makes sense for you to do with numbers like adding them or subtracting them or seeing how close or how far apart they are from one another, those do not really translate into things that it makes sense to do with words. And that is because they are not capturing that just simple recipe, I just gave you. It does not capture the kind of structure that language has. Words are used in systematic ways. So, for example, we think of some words as being similar. Man is more like woman than it is like telescope. In part, this is because man and woman tend to show up in more similar contexts across a wide range of texts than man and telescope does. By the same token, because our language is shot through with gender bias, reflecting bias that exists in our society, the word man and the word telescope are more likely to show up together than the word woman and the word telescope. The word telescope has more male connotation than the word house cat might. Word embedding is an approach that turns some of the elementary units of human language/words into mathematical objects called word vectors and it does so in such a way that the properties of those vectors capture the human-perceived meaning of the words based on how those words are actually used within a corpus, a collection of documents like the NVDRS. The vector for man and woman should be more similar to each other in a sense of similarity that makes sense for vectors than either of them is to the word telescope. Now, a vector is just a mathematical term for a list of numbers. And the simplest way to represent words as vectors would be to make a list as long as the number of distinct words in the corpus. And then fill it up with zeroes except for a single spot. And in that single spot, you put a one. And each distinct word would get a different spot where you write a one instead of a zero. You might put the word one in spot 172 for hello. Now, there are several problems with this approach. First, it is pretty wasteful. A list as long as every distinct word in your vocabulary puts a lot of zeroes in there. But also, the properties of vectors that look like that do not capture the properties of real human word usage. You might wonder for a second why I am kind of obsessed with talking about vectors and this is because vectors are really well understood. Mathematical objects that have lots of natural operations that you can do with them. It turns out that we can figure out a way to leverage those natural operations to map onto things that it makes sense to do with human language that kind of reflect actual word usage. So, with word-to-vec and with similar embedding algorithms, what we are doing is forcing the computer to use a much shorter vector, a list of a few hundred rather than many thousands of numbers to represent the word. In each spot in that list, what we call a dimension in the vector or embedding, you can have any number that we typically normalize the vector, so they are all the same length, which means that the numbers that show up tend to be relatively small numbers. The word-to-vec algorithm constructs those vectors by playing many many iterations of a sort of guessing game where you give it short snatches of text and it has to say guess a missing word from that snatch of text based on something like the average of all of the word vectors, averaging being an operation that makes sense to take with vectors. By doing this task many many times, the computer learns how to represent each word as a vector so that it succeeds at this guessing game. Now, vectors also have a nice geometric interpretation. You are almost certainly familiar with the idea of vectors in two dimensions, just an ordered pair of numbers, an X and a Y coordinate. Here is an example where there are a bunch of words represented as two dimensional vectors. To find in this space the word vector for girl, which you can see here as .66 and .89. You go .66 units on the X-axis, .89 units on the Y-axis. As you can see, many of the other words in that vicinity are semantically similar. Girls is close to boy or to child. Now the notion of similarity that makes sense for word vectors like the ones we are talking about is something called cosine similarity. I will show you what this looks like in a moment. But basically, it means are these two vectors pointing in similar directions. The big difference in our case is that our word vectors do not live in two dimensions. They live in anywhere between 200 and 1000 dimensions. Humans can’t visualize what that looks like. If you happen to be able to, I am sure that many people who would love to talk with you to understand how on earth you can do that. But the main point here is we do not have to be able to do that visualization. The computer is able to work with these high-dimensional objects for us. Now actually, understanding how the word embedding approach works its magic has been a major project in a field called theoretical machine learning. You can think of theoretical machine learning as like the theoretical statistics of the machine learning community. It aims to understand and sort of provide guarantees about why something that you might use in the machine learning world actually works. In a series of papers, the computer scientists at Princeton, Sanjeev Arora and his colleagues, provided a really compelling explanation of why it was that the training process I described, guess missing words based on some representation of an average context, produced word vectors whose math of similarity and difference, even whose math loves vector subtraction, vector addition, map onto human recognizable meanings like similarity or even things like solving analogy problems. So, this is the work that we have built on. It gives our approach a sort of special edge. Unlike a lot of very powerful recent machine learning methods, this approach has very firm theoretical foundations. You know why it is that something is working. And because of the sort of work that all of us in this webinar do as social scientists, as public health researchers or public health officials, it matters that our methods are firmly grounded in theoretical foundations and that we can actually explain why they predict the things that they do. We are naturally skeptical of using opaque black box approaches on things like literal matters of life and death. What I am going try to do in the rest of my time is give you a quick picture of the theoretical story behind our method and then I will hand it back to Alina, who will show you some of the interesting and social science and public health relevant things that you can learn from the NVDRS using this approach. Our approach provides a path to go from word embeddings, these ways of representing words as vectors in say a 300-dimensional space to topic models, these sort of thematic building blocks of a discourse that Alina told you about. The first step in this story is the notion of a semantic space. A semantic space is just this embedding space that we were talking about before. It is where the word vectors live. I am showing it here as a 3D sphere. It is normalized. That is why it is a sphere. But in reality, it does not live in three dimensions. It lives in 300 dimensions. And the theoretical model that was developed by Arora and his colleagues is a simple model of how text is produced. In that model, we have something called a discourse vector. This is just some location, some arrow pointing in the semantic space. It represents – you can think of it as a latent variable representing what is being talked about in a particular moment in time. Now, how does that discourse vector actually determine the words that show up in the text to manifest things that we can observe? There is a very simple model here where the probability of a particular word, W, being written down or spoken or somehow put in the text at a particular moment, given where that discourse vector is at that particular moment is just proportional to the similarity of the discourse vector at that time and the word vector. In other words, how similar in this cosine similarity sense is C sub-T, the discourse vector at time T, the little red vector and V sub-W, the vector representing that particular word. So, for example, if the vectors are very close and you can see they are pointing in similar direction, which means they are similar in this cosine similarity sense. Then there is a high probability that whatever word that great arrow represents will be produced, will be in the text. By contrast, if the vectors are far apart, as you can see here, then there is a low probability of the word whatever the one that is represented by the dotted gray line being used. Now note, this is basically like a topic in a topic model. It is a distribution, a probability distribution over words. In fact, given this recipe I have just told you, every position that the discourse vector points, in fact, any vector in the embedding space defines a topic in this sense. So now, imagine that we pick words to appear in the text or to be spoken or however language is being generated. We pick it according to this probabilistic process while the discourse vector is slowly doing some random walk in that space. It turns out that that generative model, that picture of how text is produced generates text such that if you do the word-to-vec trick, you train a machine learning algorithm to predict words based on some average representation of the context as shown here where, for example, you might say let us average the word vectors for ‘the cat sits on the’ and then predict mat on the basis of that. When you train an algorithm in that way, you get vectors whose mathematical properties provably encode some aspects of their semantic structure. This encoding is one of the things that got everyone so very excited about root embeddings. You can use them to solve analogies, for example, because there turns out to be hidden directions in that space that capture key semantic and syntactic, that is, meaning and grammatical relationships. The direction that you move to go from man to woman is similar to the direction you move to get from king to queen. That is a simple encoding of a kind of gender dichotomy in the embedding space. The direction you move when you go from walking to walked is similar to the direction you move when going from swimming to swam. That is syntax, a syntactical dimension having to do with verb tense. The direction going from Turkey to Ankara is similar to the one going from Canada to Ottawa or Japan to Tokyo. The country capital relationship. That is a direction too and this is why these vector representations are so powerful. They encode a ton of semantic and syntactic structure and especially the semantic structure, the meaning structure is ripe for answering social science questions as Alina will show you. Okay now, I have told you the forward side of the story, the theoretical generative model that Arora et al. used to explain how word embeddings work. But as in the case, once you have this generative model, that provides you a way to go from observed stuff like the words that are actually in a sentence like this thing describing what word embeddings are to the latent stuff like the position of a discourse vector. So, we can estimate the position of the discourse vector, get a maximum a posteriori estimates of its position with a simple calculation, basically, taking a weighted average that is actually justified by inverting this generative model that I have just described to you. So now, we have a way to represent any particular piece of text as a trajectory in the semantic space. You take a set of words like the pink words here, a little semantic window, and then we estimate where the discourse vector was when say one of the words in that window was produced. Then we slide the window along, estimate the discourse vector position again. So, as we move through the sentence, the paragraph, the document, we reconstruct how this unobserved discourse vector is moving through the space. This is an example of something called a sentence embedding, a procedure that represents an entire sequence of words like ‘the parents talk to their children’ as a single vector produced by averaging all of those word vectors together. What you can see here as we are sliding that little window along is we are producing a sequence of sentence embeddings in this way. To recap so far, in our approach to topic modeling, a topic is still a distribution over words. It is a probability distribution over words. Some words are very probable. Some words are less probable. And every position of that discourse vector defines a topic. But now a document is not a distribution over topic. It is not some mixture or probability of talking about topic 1 versus topic 7. It is a trajectory through the semantic space and that is a big difference. It allows you to represent at fine granularity what is being talked about. Now, the problem with all of this is that semantic space is big. If we have a narrative of 150 words, I have now told you how to represent it as a sequence of 150 discourse vectors that lived in 300 dimensions. So how can we simplify this? Just like in normal topic modeling, what we want is a way to decompose semantic space into some semantic regions, some sort of conceptually coherent chunks, ideally, a small number of them, that trace out highly semantically related words. In other words, what we want to do is come up with what is called a sparse dictionary for the semantic space. Basically, what this means is I want to be able to write down any word vector in the semantic space by combining a handful of building blocks called atoms or discourse atoms plus an error term. You might ask yourself why a handful of building blocks. As Alina mentioned, real words have this property of being polysemous. They have many meanings. For example, the word vector for bank is a combination of meanings having to do with finance, a meaning having to do with rivers, a meaning that maybe has to do with the way balls bank off of things in pool, et cetera. Here is what this looks like represented in equations. I want to write down the word vector V sub–W as what is called a sparse linear combination of these discourse atoms, which are just special vectors in the embedding space plus an error. Now, remember, each of these atoms is just a vector in the embedding space. Any vector, any embedding space, as I told you, can be interpreted as a topic. So, to actually figure out what the atom means, we just use the same recipe as before for whatever that atom is. It is most likely to generate words whose vectors are close to it. We just look at the closest words to characterize an atom. Those are the most probable things that would be talked about if the discourse vector were pointing exactly in this way. This is just like what Alina was telling us to do with traditional topic models. Characterized topics by the most probable words so we can interpret them. Now we figured out how to combine these various elements together to give what you might think of as a full-blown topic model, something that can answer those two basic questions Alina mentioned before. What are the building blocks of a discourse and what building blocks are used in a specific text? We can answer these questions in the framework of word embeddings. That allows us to leverage a very powerful machinery for working with these rich, powerful semantic representations and that is one of the things that we are so excited about. So here is the basic workflow. Given a corpus like the NVDRS, we use an algorithm like word-to-vec to learn a semantic space, a space of embeddings. Then we use a sparse dictionary learning approach. We use something called KSVD to figure out the discourse atoms that best represent that semantic embedding space. These atoms are in and of themselves extremely interesting just as in normal topic modeling, just as Alina showed you. They tell us a lot about what the discourse in that corpus is like and Alina will give you some examples from the NVDRS in a moment. They do so in a way that deals gracefully with some of those problems Alina mentioned like domain-specific vocabulary, like stop words, like text of highly variable length. And they produce very semantically crisp topics that are highly coherent and quite distinct from one another. With the embedding space and the atoms, we now have the ingredients we will use to take a concrete example, a narrative from the NVDRS and figure out what topic best represents it or what topics best represent it. And the recipe here is also very simple. For a set of words in the text, we use a simple procedure to estimate the position of the discourse vector. Then we find the nearest atom to that discourse vector and assign that to the narrative. Slide the window along. Estimate a new discourse vector. See if we have a new atom and repeat. So now, a narrative is represented as a sequence of atoms. We can turn that sequence into a distribution over atoms, which ones are used a lot, which ones are used a little. We can even turn it into a simple presence-absence kind of variable. This narrative uses these atoms. It does not use these others. Now, I am going to turn it back over to Alina, who will show you how this basic procedure can be used to drive social science insights and potentially actionable public health information. ALINA ARSENIEV-KOEHLER: Could we switch oh Thank you. So now, I am showing you some of the results after we apply this new topic model to the actual NVDRS narratives. This table is showing you just a couple of the 225 topics that we discovered. Each row here is still a topic or a list of terms or words. For example, this first row is showing you here the seven most representative terms for this first topic, which we then interpreted and looked up the narratives that loaded very highly on this topic and then assigned it a label rather than just calling it topic number 1 or topic number 2. Some of the things to point out here is, one, these topics now are a lot more precise and focused and ultimately more informative than when we were applying the prior topic modeling approach. Something else that we found is that there were not any topics related explicitly to sexual orientation. This is something that reflects the fact that this inductive process – the model is discovering topics rather than us telling it what to discover necessarily. And then the last point I will make about these topics that we discovered is they really cover this very wide range of information, some of which is reflected in the structured data. For example, we have some topics that are about mental health. And then there are some topics that are not reflected in those hundreds of structured variables. We have this topic here about cleanliness or reclusive behavior. Those are things that is mentioned in the narratives but is not captured in the structured data. Here, I am showing you a heat map, which is illustrating how different manners of death have different profiles of topics. They tend to use different topics. This offers us a little bit of a face validity check to start to trust that all of this theoretical modeling and this prior work is actually really producing something that is informative when applied to the NVDRS narrative. To interpret this heat map, we have the different manners of death, for example, undetermined, unintentional, homicide. And then we have each row is a topic out of the 225 topics. There are 225 rows. Each row is showing you is there is a lot of this topic or less. If it is a lot, it is going to be a darker blue. If it is less, it is going to be closer to white. Some of the things to point out here is that again, one, we see that there are these different profiles of topics for different manners of death. And the other thing is if we start to look at which manners of death have the most similar profiles using these clustering, which is shown where my cursor is going right now, we are able to see which manners of death have similar profiles. For example, undetermined deaths and suicide have the most similar topics. That makes sense for what we know about misclassification of suicide that often many undetermined deaths might not have the evidence or information available to be classified as suicide. But it is very likely that they may have been suicide cases. We can search – do this with our other variables that are maybe more nuanced such as sexual orientation. Now, this looks a little bit different. What you are seeing here is there is this different profile by different categories for sexual orientation. Here, you will see we have the cases where it is missing and then also the cases where it is unknown as well as heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian, and gay. And something that automatically jumps out from this picture versus the previous one is that there is just a lot of topics in general among cases coded as bisexual. That actually is telling us something a little bit different, not that they are just using different topics. It is actually that cases coded bisexual tended to have a lot more words in general. These narratives tend to be very long, which is telling us then we also need to think about word count when we are analyzing these topics, but it is also just informing us about the nature of these differences in the narratives. You can also see from the clustering that the cases, for example, that are bisexual, lesbian, and gay coded tend to be more similar to one another in terms of the topics that they use. And cases that are coded as heterosexual tend to be more similar to unknown, which makes sense, given that the heterosexual cases are the majority class. So, this new topic model has provided us a large list of topics. I encourage you to go to our paper and look at the 225 topics to give you a better sense of what these themes are. We have summarized this haystack of data. We found some of these really interesting needles in the haystack, but not what? Again, we can use topics like any other type of structured variable. We can start to characterize a topic of interest in a little bit more depth and we can do so using it like any other structured variable, for example, putting it in a regression equation, which is now back to kind of more of a familiar method. We can take a topic like here is topic 53. It is about sedative and pain medications. I am showing you some of the words most representative of this topic. We can characterize using regression, which types of decedents and which types of cases tend to have a lot or less of this topic or in this case, I am going to show you the results when we have any amount of this topic versus none. I am showing you a regression table now, not necessarily to highlight every single result in the regression table. But I think it is more to just drive home this point that we can now use a topic like here we have sedative and pain medications as a dependent variable and a look at this relationship with all these other characteristics. We see, for example, that cases where the decedent is female tend to have a lot – are more likely to have this topic. And we see that by manner of death compared to suicides, homicides are a lot less likely to have this topic about sedative pain medications while undetermined deaths are a lot more likely to have this topic, which again this is corroborating what we know from previous work. But we are showing you that this topic modeling is really picking up something very informative. So, some takeaways. First, I started with this point that the NVDRS really exemplifies the challenges and promises of text data. I hope that has come across. It is this really exciting data to work with, but it is also difficult. At the same time, some of the work that we do and what we learned using NVDRS can be applied to a range of different data sources like electronic health records, for example. We ended up needing to not use existing text analysis tools but developing a new one, this discourse atom topic model, which also will be very useful, we think, for a range of data. And then what we have provided substantively is this topical summary of the information of the narratives. We have been able to look at some of the specific patterns like the presence of sedative and pain medications and what kinds of situations this topic is occurring in. With that, I will turn it over to Dr. Chang. Thank you. KAI-WEI CHANG: Thanks, Alina and Jacob for introducing the NLP technique here. I am Kai-Wei Chang. I am an associate professor in the Computer Science Department at UCLA. In the next session, I would like to talk about some concern about societal bias and language processing especially when applying this in the NVDRS narrative text mentioned LGBT individual. I will start with the word embedding models that Alina and Jacob was mentioning. Jacob has introduced the word embedding model. So just to recall here, word embedding is a technique that enables machines to understand the meaning of words by making each word into a vector in an embedded space. As these embeddings carry the meaning of words, my research has found that you can get a direction between these words and use that to represent certain semantic information. For example, if you take the word woman and minus the word man in an embedded space, and that factor can represent gender. That is that the direction between woman and man will be parallel to other representative of other genders like aunt or uncle and queen to the king. So those directions would parallel to each other. So, in another way to thinking about this is that we can take these gender directions to identify the words that can solve the analogy puzzle. For example, we can have a he to the brother and then ask the model what she is to. In this way, the model can identify a sister is a word that can solve these analogy puzzle. If we play with these type of analogy tasks then we find that where you have a he to the beer, the model can identify a she is to – the model can identify the she is to cocktail. So that is representative of the beverage that both genders usually drink. This example is kind of acute but when you apply it to certain other cases and then these can be triggering. For example, the model identify he is to physician is aligned to she is to registered nurse, which is problematic in terms of they carry the bias in occupations. And even a more triggering, the model would say he is to professor as she is to associate professor. So somehow the model captured the rank and associate that with a gender. Of course, this would be very problematic that when you apply these to some downstream applications. To get a better understanding of how the gender information is carried in the embedded space. So, in this figure, we make each word to the gender direction based on how they are closer to the pronoun she and he. The word on the left side are the words that are more closer to the pronoun she so it is more related to female. And the word on the right is more closer to the male pronoun he. We find that there are certain words that originally carry the gender information like mom, dad, brother, boy. Those were making to their corresponding genders successfully. But if you look at other words on the top – those words supposedly should not have a gender information. But still, it has been making into either male or female gender. For example, game is more closer to male whereas like sewing is actually more closer to female. So, then we confirm that this type of gender information has been carried by the word embedding model. This is not surprising because the model is learned from logical action of the text and in those texts, there is association between the gender to these words. The problem is that when we apply these word embedding models in the downstream applications like coreference resolution, then those are bias in the data and may affect the model’s performance. In this I will go into use of coreference as an example. Coreference resolution is one of the most important tasks in natural language processing. In this task, we are trying to identify the phrases that represent the same entity. For example, if you look at text on the top. In this paragraph, we talk about the president is more vulnerable than most. He is blah, blah, blah. You can see that these are pronouns his in the second sentence co-refer with the mention in the first sentence. We know that when we mention this pronoun his, it refers to the president in the first sentence. As you can imagine, this is an important task in NLP pipeline because if you want to understand a paragraph like this, then you need to know what does this pronoun refer to. Then we can check the information around this pronoun. The problem we find that is that the current NLP model can successfully identify the pronoun his is referred to the president on the text on the top. But if you look at cases on the bottom, this is identical paragraph. The only difference is now we change the male pronoun to a female pronoun. But even this small change will cost the model to make a mistake. In this case, the model cannot identify the female pronoun her is refer to the president. The problem is the model actually learn the bias in the embedded space. You think the female pronoun is more far away then an occupation like the president than the male pronoun. So, they fail to identify the correct relations. It is also because that when the model trained on the test coreference, on the test coreference contained twice more association between male and occupation than the female mentioned. The model also then the association that a male pronoun is more likely to associate with occupation than the female pronoun and we find that is problematic when we analyze the data. In terms of NVDRS narratives, again, this is an important test that we need to be able to identify the coreference relation so that we can do more detailed analysis and especially for NVDRS. There are several cases of LGBT individuals as a victim. This is especially important for us because LGBT youth are five times more likely to attempt suicide than the heterosexual youth. We really want to be able to analyze those cases well so then we can have a way to prevent suicide. So here, I show an example of the narrative in the VDN. Again, this is an example that we write to mimic other data in the coreference. As you can see that in this example, we have a sentence saying the primary victim is a 50-year-old male. The primary victim’s partner state that he and the primary victim have been living together for three years. In this case, as a human when we read these tests, we know this he should be referred to the primary victim’s partner. However, we find that the model may confuse by the gender information between the male and the pronoun he and then identify he as a primary victim rather than the primary victim’s partner. Even though from a grammatical structure, we can see that he must be to refer to these phrases in the same sentence. But the models – they all make mistakes. This is one of the challenges that we find that when applying the correct model in this NVDRS is a narrative. To better understand how the current model is found in this narrative, we perform a data notation and then do a comprehensive study to see how the current coreference system to work on these data sets. What we did is we sample several narratives from the data based on the gender of the victim and the partner. Specifically, we got 30 narratives where the victim is a male, and the partner is female. In another 30 cases where the victim is a female, and the partner is male. In 30 cases that the victim and the partner are in the same gender. And then we hired three experienced coders to annotate the correct information. And then the coder is guided by the senior public health experts. As we can see that the model actually suffers from understanding the correct relations in NVDRS narrative, especially for a new pronoun, the model performance is worse. If we use the current based coreference model, the model can achieve around 80 percent in the F1 in the general NLP text. But for the specific type of LGBT narrative, the model can achieve around 40 percent. And for the neopronoun cases, the model performed even worse. One other reason is the model does not really understand new pronouns and also the model cannot understand expression like partner or instead of girlfriend or boyfriend or wife and husband. This is a kind of a different way to express to cause a model to understand those text. So, a little question here is how can we improve the model to understanding those narratives. We tried a simple way to deal with that. That is, we are trying to augment the data by replacing some of the phrases to other phrases. For example, we can switch an agenda so when we say see a boyfriend in a text then we switch that to a girlfriend. When we say the pronoun he, then we also switch the gender. In this way, we can eliminate the information of the gender in annotated data, and we find that even using these simple techniques we can improve the models. But to be honest even with these techniques, we are still not able to achieve 100 percent performance on this data set. This is still a research direction to how to improve the model on this type of narrative. Okay so this is an example that we find that the current model has a trouble to deal with LGBT cases in the NVDRS data set. But in general, we find that the current NLP model has an issue to identify LGBT individual text. For example, the current language model can do very well on the following game. That if I give you a sentence and I take out one word in the sentence and the model can predict what is a word I should be putting to make this sentence correct. So, if I give you a sentence like this, Alex went to the hospital for their appointment, and someone felt sick. Supposedly, if the model understands the non-binary gender, the model should put they as an insert, and to make this consistent with these gender pronouns there. But the model actually put she or he with high probability. And they have a very low probability score. The model is not the right answer. And this is a consistent phenomenon that we find that in many cases. For example, when we look at the closest word of a gender pronoun, we find that model has a trouble to understand those new pronouns of xe and ze. To get a better understanding of the problem, we conduct a survey with 19 participants and to understand what is the issue in the NLP model when they apply to the text with LGBT mentions. We find that in many NLP applications that identify an entity with coreference resolution of machine translation, there are different cases that the LGBT community find that it is problematic, and it will cause some harm to those LGBT individuals. So, we summarize some of these cases in our paper. In the interest of time, I am not going to go through the details of all these cases. But I refer people to this paper to the discussions and analyses of how the current NLP technique has trouble to deal with those LGBT cases. Just to give a quick summary of what I said. We find that there is bias in the automatic models that when they use to analyze the data, they may influence the results. It is essential to improve the inclusion of the NLP technique so that you can work better on those cases. Okay with this, I will turn to the mike to Dr. Mays. VICKIE MAYS: What I am going to talk about today has to do with using non-AI approaches, as I think Dr. Cochran started in the beginning talking about. There are two different types of data that are in the NVDRS. One is the narratives, and the other is the quantitative data. And so, part of what we decided to think about is using the qualitative data to indicate things that we thought should be variables in the quantitative data so that you did not have to keep searching and searching. The study goals that we did was what kind of indicators are associated with LGBT suicide in the data set. Can we develop these into quantitative measures that would be specific questions asked? Last is can we reduce the public health coder bias and increase reliance on facts that would occur through the investigations because it would be required to have this actual data to do it. In terms of the narratives for the study, we used the data from 2003 to 2017. We restricted it just to the suicide data. What we did was we selected 1200 suicide deaths, which meant that if we were using the narratives, there are two narratives for each case. One will be for the medical examiner’s coroners and the other one is from law enforcement. We could have as many as 2400. We knew that 621 of those 1200 – we knew that they were LGBT cases. I think Dr. Cochran talked about that in the beginning that we used things that were identified by CDC. In the ones that we knew to be LGBT, 54 percent were gay males, 28 percent lesbians, 10 percent transgender, and 8 percent bisexual. Then we selected another randomly 579 cases to give us 1200. We used six undergraduate students as raters. All of them were trained in terms of suicide awareness. Some of them were very knowledgeable about LGBT populations either from their own lived experiences or they had siblings. They had worked on hotlines. There was a lot of knowledge that we wanted to make sure they had before we put them into this. And then we had one undergraduate. You can see the influence of Dr. Cochran here, who was a stat major. That person actually was in the background kind of putting our batches together, setting up what the coder agreements were. Each time we had a set of trainings. Here is what we did in order to reach inter-rater reliability. The coders finished a batch. They did it individually. They met. They discussed it. They came up with what their disagreements were and then they re-coded again. And then we saw again when it is that they reached – still had disagreements. What happened then is that they had another – the way in which we resolved this is that they had another session. We looked at who were our coders that had the most discrepancy. Who were the coders that did well? And then we matched them. It is like a training. We matched them with coders who had done well to then explain kind of what the agreement and disagreement were and that allowed us to be able to do our inter-rater reliability. Here, what you can see is how we did this because we did not just hand them 1200. We started out with a batch of what we call practice cases. These were not in the actual 1200. But we ended up with practice cases. And then we started it. We would go through, and You can see how we started off in the practice cases with only about 33 percent agreement. But we would go through, and you can see when we had people come back again, we could reach agreement. It told us a lot about some of the things that I think my colleagues have talked about is this is not easy work. I think one of the things you will find over time is that as language changes, the training will even need to be greater. It is a really big deal that we have in this work is language does tend to change particularly in the SOGI population. We are going to have to pay attention to that. You heard Dr. Cochran talk about Dr. Clark, who at the time was a graduate student with us, her work on bullying. Here is an example of what a code sheet looks like. Since this paper is published, we actually took this one. What we did was we needed in this back and forth to come up with a definition of what is coding. What you have to do is decide in these narratives when to code the presence of bullying and when it is actually there and when to code that it is absent. What you are trying to do is to code whether it is present or absent. Then there might be some specific things that will come up in the course of doing this work that you want to actually give the coders an idea about in case there are things that are a little off or what have you. Let us look at the results. The question is what factors were more characteristic in LGBT suicide narratives. We found seven of the characteristics. I will give you a couple because the rest of them we are in the midst of writing and finishing up the paper. But, again, this HIV/AIDS history. I know some people think it is stigmatizing. It is one of the things that particularly for gay men we were able if that was in the narrative, to find out with great probability that this was likely to be a gay man. Part of what we also have to think about is we focus sometimes on the pharmacologic and behavioral interventions in terms of HIV and It may be that what we are discovering is that there is a relationship between HIV and suicide that we may need to attend to. In this instance, I think having this variable I think as Dr. Cochran said is actually insightful. What we did come up with in terms of the other six characteristics is typically, they were very specific kinds of conflicts or discriminations within LGBT that if, for example, family conflict around coming out or something like that were there, we were pretty good at even though the words to the relationships around LGBT might not be there, we were able to identify that that was an LGBT case. What did not work, and I have to applaud my undergraduates. They spent a lot of time on this. We tried to use the interpersonal theory of suicide. This is Joiner’s theory. And we actually developed code sheet for perceived burdensome and thwarted belongingness. I think as a matter of fact, this work actually began when Kirsty Clark was with us and we attempted to develop these code sheets, hoping to be able to use this. It just did not work. If you just use stigma and it is not a specific stigma, it does not work either because stigma just in and of itself did not identify LGBT but it just identified suicide. I think it is important to think about how can we come up with things in which given that the way that NVDRS runs, which is the LGBT status is only there if it has something very specific to do with the death. That we are finding that there are contexts that really have to do with LGBT deaths that those should be in the quantitative data and determine so that we can more easily identify LGBT individuals. What are the recommendations that we made from this particular study? First of all, we need to treat SOGI as classification variables and include them in the quantitative data rather than only coding it if it is a factor in the suicide. We do this in terms of age. We do this in terms of race ethnicity. We need to think about doing this also to the extent that it is possible because in an investigation, you might not always get this. But if it is included as part of the quantitative data, you get better ability for surveillance and monitoring of suicides as a population health activity as opposed to just worrying about the person. It will allow states to actually do much better at looking at the population of LGB and some of the other parts. Also, increase specific set of questions as part of the data gathering in investigations and by cross referencing these records with the vital statistics where what you are looking at is if you know who the person is, can you look? In some states, you will be able to tell if people have changed their birth record. In the birth record, I did not want to say the certificate because it is in the birth record, which is kind of behind a firewall. But being able to do that would actually really facilitate better use of this data. My job being the last is to do some summary comments about the R21 in general. What did we learn in this research? The R21 was an appropriate mechanism. For those of you who were thinking about what to do, R21 was great. We developed a proof of concept in our model. That leads us to point that we can apply for an R01. We have been so busy generating papers; we have not done that yet. We started out with an intention to focus on LGBT studies, but it required a lot of data cleaning and exploratory development work. Yes, now we are poised for an R01. But what you need to hear is we are almost in a privileged position to be able to do this because we had other funding. Almost all of us have regular FTEs. It really took a lot of work to clean the data. I think you heard about misspelled words, all this other stuff to get the machine learning to work. It takes a lot of work to clean the data set up. I think Dr. Cochran talked about this. The most useful way to do this work is to realize that you need a team. That it cannot be just a couple of you. Again, R21s do not give you a lot of money to do that. I have to applaud my colleagues for joining us in this because it was not about money. But it was a lot about making these methods work better. The work was actually much more difficult than we thought. Some of us are very senior investigators. We thought we could just blow through this. But part of what we needed was this innovation of methodologies, which is why we brought more colleagues on. We also have to move beyond this assuming the political nature of the records to pursue an understanding of representations of representations of representations, meaning that – in terms of thinking about bias, thinking about how bias is generated, we really have to realize that there are a lot of different kinds of biases here. We have to really kind of figure out how we are going to deal with that. We are still in the process of achieving some of our goals. We have about four to six papers still in the works. What are some of the questions that we still have to answer? Can we reduce suicides through interventions in clinical settings? We are hopeful to be able to use these models in terms of EHRs. We understand the context of the violent deaths particularly in trans populations. Here, we think the work is really understanding the homicides. What we want to do is look at what the investigations are like. Can we provide evidence-based rationale for states to engage in surveillance and monitoring as a cost-effective intervention? That is something that I think is very important. Is the right approach to these questions to actually use this dataset that we are using or is there other data? Should we be thinking about modifying the data systems or modifying the data? We have suicide prevention methods. A question is what can we learn using the data that we have that will allow us to adapt to LGB and especially T or much like we discovered in HIV where they wanted us to adapt methods. It really did not work. We needed to start anew. For those of you who are HIV researchers, it was in the DEBIs. That is a big question I think that still exists. I am going to stop here and move us to the questions that may be in the question and answer – I know I answered, and Dr. Cochran answered. Some of the questions have been answered. But if people feel they are unanswered still to ask again. TAMARA LEWIS JOHNSON: Thank you, Dr. Mays and all of the presenters, for that outstanding presentation, a panel of talks, very important cutting-edge questions on what ways to address violent deaths among LGBTQ populations and the application and the development of innovative technologies to be able to track and monitor this. If all the speakers could unmute and turn their cameras on, I am going to go to the Q&A box, and we will get started. Thank you for all of you that have hung in there with us because we are getting to the good part of the opportunity to get your questions answered. Here is a question. If the machine learning process takes place at a certain time with text samples from a certain time period, does it change the accuracy of the prediction of the word vector? For example, with words related to SOGI that are very dynamic, it may change significantly over time. How does this process of embedding account for that change over time? ALINA ARSENIEV-KOEHLER: I can take that question. That is a great question. That is actually a bigger area of work with text analysis is how do we do all these methods knowing that language changes. It is not static. In the particular examples that we are showing, we are taking all the vocabulary whatever time it is from so even if there was a word that was only used in 2000. We will have that word at least in our bucket of possible words that can be used. But ideally, you also can look at how a word that might be used in two different time periods, it might even change across time too. We know that the word queer, for example, has really changed meaning across time and that is something that is an active other area of work with computational text analysis. VICKIE MAYS: Can I also comment? One of the things that I have great worries about because I sit on all these different committees, and one is within academic medical centers, and we are trying to figure out in the electronic health record to get people to put in their identity variables. The problem is that in doing that when we start to figure out what is quality data, what is quality control, it is almost like if the bioinformatics group does not almost every six months or so relook at what they are collecting and how to make sure that they can expand it then we are going to lose. And what you know is that in electronic health records, that is expensive. We have to figure out some way because I think whoever asked that question -- it is a great question. It is a question that we are worrying about in terms of transferring all these great scientific facts we are finding into an applied system, a system that normally – remember, we use – I will not call out brand names. But remember in the electronic health record, that is very costly in terms of going in and doing some re-engineering. It is costly for CDC in terms of the National Center for Health Statistics to re-engineer systems. It is costly for the states to re-engineer how they collect that data in vital records. We have a problem that we have to figure out in order to use all this wonderful science. TAMARA LEWIS JOHNSON: Great. Thank you so much. Here is another question that is coming in. The person says I am curious to know more about the coding of interpersonal theory of suicide variables and constructs within the NVDRS narratives. Do you think this means that these constructs are less relevant to LGBTQ folks? Also, would you be willing to speak more about and/or share the coding sheets for how bothersomeness and belongingness were coded within the NVDRS? VICKIE MAYS: What we think – we spent a lot of time on this because we wanted to have the theory actually match what we were seeing. And Joiner’s suicide theory is the only one that actually talks about actual completed suicides. We thought it would be a perfect match. What it is is that those terms do not distinguish. Part of what you want to think about is that those experiences are just more universal. They are just not as specific to LGBT. It is funny. Whoever asked that question, thank you because it makes me think about, we should write a paper still to say what we learned that it did not work is actually learning that this is a universal experience, and it is not an LGBT other letters experience. I think we have learned something. I do not know how to make it be specific. Again, our code sheets that work in terms of predictability, they all tended to have some very specific unique things that many LGBT people would experience that if a State put that in their coding, they would be able to do just much better surveillance. Whoever it was wants to contact me, I will be happy to talk through a little bit more about how our code sheets did. TAMARA LEWIS JOHNSON: Here is a question for Dr. Arseniev-Koehler and Dr. Foster. How can the topic modeling approach to examine sexual orientation and gender identity data on suicide be applied to other mental illness such as depression, anxiety, and things like that? ALINA ARSENIEV-KOEHLER: I can take it and then Jacob can add to whatever I miss. Two different ways. One, you could – just like we did the heat map with sexual orientation, and we had that heat map with manner of death. You could also think of doing that kind of same approach where you are looking at the different distributions of topics across different categories of the structured mental health variables. There are variables such as had this person had a recent crisis in mental health. Does the person seem like they had depressed mood prior to the death? Did they have a diagnosed mental illness? You could search and use those variables and look at the topics. And then the flipside is you could go through the 225 topics, which again are just public on the paper. You can look at them. Then you can start to think some of these match up with the structured variables and some of them offer some insights relevant to mental health that are not captured in the structured variables. You could use those in that regression framework like I showed you with the sedative and pain medications and look which types of death tend to have this particular topic about mental health. That can give you some more insights. TAMARA LEWIS JOHNSON: Great. Here is an incoming question from the audience. Is there anything a patient advocate can do to help support patients, health care providers, administration, and researchers to promote the collection of data? VICKIE MAYS: I am happy to answer that one. Thank you very much. One bugs the systems. What you want to do is to ask the states, whatever state you are in, or work with the state organizations to say you have all this administrative data, but it is not being able to be mined and it is not being able to be mined as easily because it needs better coding. It needs better ways of identifying it. To be able to have LGBT as an identity status variable, the same way you have age or race, as an advocate. Think about that. I cannot guarantee that it is easy to get. But at least if you have it in some, it allows us to be able to use it better. I think that one of the things I am going to caution you about and I am right in the midst of writing something about this is we have to be careful of what we ask for. You can ask for data to be collected. But you must in these days ask about privacy protection. Right now, I do not have to tell you that as jurisdictions begin to change kind of their legal policies, we put people at risk. As you ask, balance with protection. TAMARA LEWIS JOHNSON: Thank you so much, Dr. Mays, for that question. Dr. Foster, did you have something that you wanted to say about the interpersonal theory of suicide variables and constructs as it relates to NVDRS narratives? JACOB G. FOSTER: No. I just wanted to amplify Alina’s comment about the analysis of our mental health questions vis-a-vie the discourse atom topic model approach and say whoever asked the question, great question. And it is something we are actively looking at because obviously that is a very important dimension particularly in the suicide violent deaths. As Alina said, there are really interesting facets of some of those conditions that do not come up in the structured variables that we can see in the narratives and the way that they are talked about. I would underline, as Alina said, like the paper is open access on PNAS. It is also because of NIH funding available. Just spend some time with the caveats that Dr. Cochran made. Some of this is upsetting stuff to read about. But just spend some time looking at those topics. We made the choice. Give all of them in the supporting materials so you can see what they are and read some of the terms because I think there is a ton of interesting work that can be done along these lines with the NVDRS and many other texts – these unstructured text data resources using this approach. Spend some time looking at it and see what you can do. TAMARA LEWIS JOHNSON: Great. Thank you so much. Dr. Chang, I have a question for you. Given that augmentation rules may not fully address diversities of sexual orientation, what considerations should investigators incorporate into their study design? KAI-WEI CHANG: That is a very good question. I think technically, there are several ways that we can improve the model inclusive. Data augmentation is one way to do that. There are many other ways that we can consider. For example, we can do some projections in the embedded space to make the model better to be aware of different gender. But another thing that is more important is that when people design a study, they should be aware of this issue. So aware that a model may not perform well in all the cases and especially for some LGBT groups or some other minority group, the model may perform extremely worse in those cases. When we apply the model, we need to be careful and then we need to go deeper to look at those cases to see if the performance of the model is expected. If not, we can from the technical side, to try to improve the model. But for the other side, we need to be careful when we get any conclusion from those models. TAMARA LEWIS JOHNSON: Great. Thank you so much, Dr. Chang. Here is another question. We, as a state, are creating systems integration across all of our health care and human services to collect SOGI data for service, population needs as well as population and health and health equity. Are there some tips and lessons learned outside of the NVDRS for a broader collection and usage of SOGI data? And insights that you might have about data privacy and confidentiality as we have user input asking different questions for their identity than current questions so the complexity increases. VICKIE MAYS: One of the things that I think is important is if you are doing this in terms of your system is first to figure out what linkages can you do so that you do not have to keep asking in every place but instead you have checks and balances. That is number one. Can you, for example, go to the vital records? Will your mortality in vital records be a check and balance? Linkages, I think, would be one of my first wishes. The second wish I would say is again and I kind of talked about this is language is going to constantly change. You are going to need somebody like Professor Chang, who is going to be able to give you some kind of formula by which you can constantly upgrade that language so that you can capture some of the differences because that language can actually – they may be generational differences. They may be race ethnicity differences and we have not talked about that a lot. That is also important. That language is about culture, and you need to understand how to do that. This is why we are very happy that we have Dr. Chang with us because that is part of what he does. The third thing is in terms of bias, I think you need to understand what biases are. We always think about discrimination. That is not just the bias. Dr. Chang has talked about bias. Everyone else has talked. You have to figure out that there are many different types of biases to address that come into data in very different ways. Some are human biases. Some are machine biases. Some of them are kind of the system bias of how you structured your EHR or how you structured your data set. You have to remember that the use of the data will make a big difference. If your clinical data and survey data are totally different in terms of the comfort that people may have of giving you information. I applaud whoever is re-doing their system and they want to do this. I say bring many people to the table and get a data governance agreement about where you want to end up. TAMARA LEWIS JOHNSON: Thank you so much, Dr. Mays and to all the presenters this afternoon for this outstanding panel of presentations of a very important and relevant topic to the NIMH and to public health. I want to say that our next and final webinar of the ODWD webinar series is the NIH scientific workforce diversity initiatives, promoting inclusive excellence in the extramural research ecosystem on the 22 of September. If you have not already done so, I encourage you to sign up and register to attend that. Thank you. We are recording and archiving this presentation. There will be a transcript. All of this information will be available in the coming weeks on the ODWD webpage. Thank you so much for taking time to listen to the presentations and to participate. Have a good rest of your day.

> Office for Disparities Research and Workforce Diversity Webinar Series: Advancing Methods and Measures to Examine the Underlying Mechanisms of Violent Deaths in LGBTQ Populations Date Location Overview This webinar presented methods and measures to enhance data collection efforts on violent deaths among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) populations. Due to multiple minority stressors, LGBTQ individuals are at increased risk for suicide and violent death. Health risk literature suggests that LGBTQ people are more likely to die by violent death than their non-LGBTQ peers. At the time of death, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) data are not systematically collected, and actual mortality disparities and the context of those deaths are not well known. This research fills a glaring gap in LGBTQ research, and it will transform the status of mortality data collection to better identify SOGI, which facilitates studies to guide prevention and intervention research around preventable deaths among LGBTQ populations.

> Office for Disparities Research and Workforce Diversity Webinar Series: Understanding Stigma and Discrimination as Drivers of Mental Health Disparities for Diverse, Rural, LGBTQ+ Communities Date Location Overview This webinar presented the goals and procedures of the Rural Engagement and Approaches For LGBTQ+ Mental Health (REALM) study, which is developing a longitudinal cohort of diverse LGBTQ+ adults residing in rural and small metropolitan communities across the United States. Employing a minority stress framework, REALM aims to determine the following: whether types of stigma, discrimination, and traumatic experiences vary across LGBTQ+ groups; how these exposures are associated with increased prevalence and incidence of depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts; and if and how proximal minority stress-related factors mediate and/or moderate these associations. Further, building on these findings, REALM will compare the relative acceptability of various technology-delivered intervention components for depression and suicide prevention for diverse rural LGBTQ+ communities. Challenges with online recruitment and enrollment and creative solutions were shared, in addition to lessons learned in how to ensure participant safety. The webinar ended with a description of the cohort to date and shared preliminary baseline findings related to study aims.

Levine, M.D., (she/her), Assistant Secretary for Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Shelli Avenevoli, Ph.D., (she/her), Deputy Director, National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) Karen L. Parker, Ph.D., M.S.W., (she/her), Director, Sexual and Gender Minority Research Office, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Monica Webb Hooper, Ph.D., (she/her), Deputy Director, National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) Wilson Compton, M.D., M.P.E., (he/him), Deputy Director, National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Dr. Stacia Friedman-Hill welcomed attendees to the workshop and highlighted the collective efforts of several NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices to coordinate it. She invited HHS and NIH leaders to present their welcoming remarks. Admiral Rachel Levine introduced herself as the first transgender Senate-confirmed federal official and the first transgender four-star Admiral in the U.S. Public Health Service Commission Corps. She underscored the critical impact of adverse childhood events (ACEs) among LGBTQI+ youth, who are disproportionately affected by discrimination, bullying, child abuse, neglect, sexual violence, dating violence, unstable housing, and food insecurity. She emphasized the importance of recognizing not only the ACEs common to this community, but also the positive childhood experiences (PCEs) that can improve health and well-being. PCEs could include nurturing relationships with parents, friends, and other adults in the community; feelings of belonging at school or in their community; and engaging in after-school activities and cultural traditions. Admiral Levine acknowledged the politically- and ideologically-motivated attacks on LGTBQI+ communities in the U.S. and called for the nation to do better. Dr. Shelli Avenevoli reviewed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2021 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance (YRBS) Surveys for high school students, which showed increases in mental illness symptoms among females and LGBTQI+ high school students. Nearly 60 percent of female students and 70 percent of LGTBQI+ students experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness. Approximately 10 percent of female students and more than 20 percent of LGTBQI+ students attempted suicide. Sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth often experienced disparities in mental illness, access to healthcare, quality of care, and experiences of trauma and adversity; youth with more than one marginalized identity experienced even greater disparities. Dr. Avenevoli highlighted NIMH’s efforts to expand knowledge, remove barriers to conducting research, and strengthen the community of researchers in this field. Dr. Karen Parker emphasized the critical need to improve data collection on sexual orientation and gender identity and expression (SOGIE) among minors. She highlighted existing gaps in research, calling for studies that capture the full spectrum of nuanced experiences, perpetual misconceptions, and critical health disparities in this community. She noted that this workshop was a pivotal opportunity to challenge this status quo and push the boundaries toward more inclusive and comprehensive health research. Dr. Monica Webb Hooper highlighted NIMHD’s commitment to addressing the mental health needs of SGM youth and noted the official designation of SGM groups as a population experiencing health disparities for research purposes. She spoke of two recent NIMHD efforts to advance this area of science: a March 2023 workshop on the leading causes of death among SGM communities and a cross-NIH funding opportunity on SGM health disparities. Dr. Webb said that there were three priority research areas to address mental health concerns among SGM. First, there was a need for research on prevention and intervention strategies that include multilevel mechanisms and promote culturally-competent, gender-affirming, and trauma-informed care. Second, there was a need for research on the nuances of intersectionality and interventions that recognize the heterogeneity of this community. Third, there was a need to develop a workforce of SGM researchers. She called for a world in which all young people, including SGM individuals, could thrive mentally, emotionally, and physically. Dr. Wilson Compton explained that there were higher rates of substance use among SGM youth and the importance of understanding both risk factors and resilience. He noted that while the increased incidence of ACEs in this community could have an impact on substance use, it was important to recognize that the issue was not simple but rather had multiple, overlapping risks. He called for a focus on risk factors and resilience, more inclusive and comprehensive research, and improved data collection standards to enhance research. Dr. Compton highlighted the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study as a key resource for understanding adolescent brain development and developmental trajectories. Developmental Trajectories, Epidemiological Trends, and Measurement of Sexual Orientation and Gender Discussant: Kathleen A. Ethier, Ph.D., (she/her), Director, Division of Adolescent and School Health, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Moderator: Parisa Parsafar, Ph.D., (she/her), Office of Health Equity, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Minority Stress and Health—Are Younger LGBT People Faring Better Now? Ilan Meyer, Ph.D., (he/him), Williams Institute, UCLA School of Law Dr. Ilan Meyer noted that stigma, homophobia, and transphobia were deeply rooted in culture and referenced the Minority Stress Model to explain how societal structures and disadvantaged statuses contribute to both external (distal) and internal (proximal) stress. He reviewed his Generations study to determine whether societal changes over the past 60 years had led to improved mental health outcomes among LGB individuals. He looked across three generations of LGB adults: the “pride/identity formation” cohort of LGB individuals aged 52-59 in 2016, the “visibility” cohort of LGB individuals aged 34 to 41 in 2016, and the “equality” cohort of LGB individuals aged 18 to 25 in 2016. In terms of “coming out,” the younger cohort came out nearly 10 years earlier than older cohorts, indicating changes in societal acceptance and self-awareness. Younger cohorts also reported higher levels of violence, everyday discrimination, stigma, and internalized homophobia than older cohorts. The youngest cohort experienced higher levels of depression, anxiety, and suicide attempts—particularly after coming out. There was no significant reduction in exposure to conversion therapy across all age groups. Despite today’s culture of not identifying with specific LGBT terms, there was still a strong connection to LGBT identity among all age groups. Dr. Meyer concluded that there were significant ongoing challenges in healthcare access and outcomes among LGBT individuals despite societal progress, indicating a need for research and interventions to address disparities. He also noted that transgender individuals had not been included in his hypothesis and study because there had not been a significant reduction in attitudes towards transgender individuals over the years. Using Gender and Sexuality Measures in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study to Promote Wellness Alexandra S. Potter, Ph.D., (she/her), Department of Psychiatry,University of Vermont Dr. Alexandra Potter reviewed the ABCD Study as a research resource to help investigators better understand SGM youth. The ABCD Study began in 2015 and was a longitudinal neuroimaging study of nearly 12,000 youth aged 9 to 10 at enrollment. The study aimed to characterize developmental trajectories and explore the factors influencing development. ABCD data were released annually and was open source. The study encompassed several domains, each with oversight by a workgroup, experts, and a steering committee. The domain on gender identity and sexual health was developed in partnership with the CDC Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH) to help them improve their measures. The gender identity and sexual health workgroup was charged with recommending developmentally sensitive assessments of gender and sexuality. Initially, baseline assessments included a question about being transgender. At the one-year follow-up, they added an additional measure about felt gender. At the three-year follow-up, participants were asked two-step gender identity questions about sex assigned at birth and current gender identity. Dr. Potter noted that felt gender described how much a person felt like a certain gender, whereas gender identity was an internal choice of a gender term. Only 1 percent of the participants declined to answer the gender-related questions, indicating high acceptance. At ages 10 to 11, approximately 80 percent of participants identified with their sex assigned at birth. By ages 13 to 15, this distribution became more varied across gender identity. Dr. Potter described the questions about sexual orientation. At baseline, participants were asked whether they identified as gay or bisexual. Over time, they expanded these questions to include a broader range of sexual attraction and identity. Whereas at the two-year mark, just over 8 percent of participants identified as gay or bisexual, more than 25 percent identified as such by the five-year mark. Later in the study, they added a question that framed sexuality by attraction—the results of which were consistent with the measure for sexual orientation. Dr. Potter emphasized that these data provided a unique opportunity for investigators to advance research on SGM youth. Mental Health and Suicide Research with LGBTQ+ Young People Derrick D. Matthews, Ph.D., M.P.H., (he/him), Director of Research Science, The Trevor Project Dr. Derrick Matthews talked about The Trevor Project’s mission to prevent suicide prevention among LGBTQ+ youth through crisis services and research. Their research priorities span three areas: 1) knowledge acquisition—through monthly research briefs and peer-reviewed manuscripts, 2) internal knowledge sharing—ensuring that research supports their crisis services and other activities, and 3) external knowledge sharing—to ensure that their research is accessible to people outside of the organization. Dr. Matthews presented key findings from their 2024 U.S. National Survey on the Mental Health of LGBTQ+ Young People. More than 18,000 participants aged 13 to 24 and living in the U.S. were recruited via social media. The participants completed a comprehensive survey of approximately 134 questions offered in both English and Spanish. The survey revealed that nearly 40 percent of LGBTQ+ youth seriously considered suicide, and 12 percent had attempted suicide in the past year. Among these, individuals under the age of 18 were the most likely to consider and attempt suicide. There were differences across sexual orientation, with those identifying as queer, pansexual, or questioning youth having the highest rates of considering and attempting suicide. Across gender identity, transgender, non-binary queer, and questioning youth had the highest rates of considering and attempting suicide. Across race, Native and Indigenous LGBTQ+ youth overwhelmingly had the highest rates of considering and attempting suicide, followed by those who identified as multiracial. The majority of LGBTQ+ youth reported experiences of anxiety and depression. Dr. Matthews emphasized the need to capture diverse gender identities and sexual orientations in research to help disentangle the experiences of diverse subgroups. He also emphasized the importance of capturing intersectionality. He noted that The Trevor Project was changing their survey to be administered every other year instead of every year so that they could engage in additional research efforts such as longitudinal, qualitative, and state-level studies. Longitudinal Research Involving Trans and Non-Binary Youth Johanna Olson-Kennedy, M.D., (she/her), Keck School of Medicine of USC, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles Dr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy started by highlighting challenges in trans and non-binary youth research. First, the number of trans and non-binary youth accessing services was very small. In the U.S., 2017 to 2021 marked the first five years in which there was a real increase of people accessing puberty blocker services—but this still represented less than 5,000 people. Gender-affirming hormone services started increasing a few years earlier, but only 14,000 youth were receiving these services. With more than 120,000 youth receiving a diagnosis of gender dysphoria during these years, the number of youth receiving services represented less than 10 percent. Another challenge was the ability to conduct longitudinal research. Data beyond 5 to 7 years after utilization of these services were scarce because the services among youth were relatively new. Further, data collection for transitioning youth could be a challenge as these individuals aged out of pediatric care. There were also ethical challenges in using control arms in studies because of the strong evidence of the benefits of these services. The current bans on youth care and data misinterpretation by anti-trans groups also limited the ability to collect data. Dr. Olson-Kennedy shared preliminary findings from the NIH-funded Trans Youth Care study, an observational study that began in 2015 with 84 youth using puberty-blocking services and 315 youth starting gender-affirming hormones. Two-year data showed that the youth had stable mental health (assessed with the NIH Emotional Health Toolbox) before and after services, with some reductions in rule-breaking behaviors. Dr. Olson-Kennedy noted that these youth often had strong parental support, which was crucial for both their mental health and access to services. She also noted that most participants were non-Hispanic white individuals and called for investigators to explore how to increase access to these services among communities of color. Although the use of puberty blockers was being attacked in the U.S., this research showed the tremendous benefits the services can have on this community. Challenges in Measuring Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Youth and Young Adults Gregory Phillips II, Ph.D., (he/him), Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University Dr. Gregory Phillips expressed enthusiasm for the CDC’s YRBS as a tool for better understanding SGM youth. The YRBS was a biennial survey that assesses health behaviors among high school students in the U.S. YRBS was both a national survey managed by the CDC and a jurisdictional survey that states and jurisdictions could alter to suit their local needs. In 2015, questions about sexual orientation were added. In 2017, questions about transgender identity were piloted in certain jurisdictions. Dr. Phillips talked about a particular challenge in the YRBS—the “not sure” category for sexual orientation created confusion. In 2019, 3.2 percent of high school students responded, “not sure.” However, the response could indicate uncertainty about sexual orientation, a lack of understanding about the question, or dissatisfaction with the answer options. In 2021, the YRBS was updated to break “not sure” into three distinct categories: 1) “I describe my sexual identity some other way,” 2) I am not sure about my sexual identity or questioning,” and 3) “I do not know what this question is asking.” This change allowed for a better understanding of responses. As another example of the importance of precise sex and gender definitions, Dr. Phillips explained how the 2017 pilot of transgender status paired with a binary question about sex (male or female) created a challenge of not knowing whether an individual identified as trans male or trans female. Dr. Phillips reviewed his research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth under the RADx-Up initiative, which revealed significant mental health challenges related to disrupted developmental processes such as identity formation and community building, exacerbated stigma, and loss of autonomy. However, there were some positives during the pandemic, including finding online communities and having an opportunity to come out to their families. He concluded by advocating for using existing data such as the YRBS, an expansive list of SGM identity questions to allow respondents to pick multiple terms, a recognition that identity can change over time, and a focus on mixed-methods research to contextualize findings. The Common Intersection of Autism and Gender Diversity John F. Strang, Psy.D., (he/him), Children’s National Hospital, George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences Dr. John Strang talked about the intersection between gender diversity and autism. Gender-supporting clinicians had been observing a significant overlap between gender diversity and autism for more than 20 years. As of 2024, more than 50 studies had been conducted on this intersection, and a 2023 meta-analysis indicated that approximately 11 percent of gender-diverse individuals were diagnosed with autism as compared to 2.3 percent of the general population. Dr. Strang emphasized that this intersection was also evident at the trait level, with a significant relationship between both autistic and gender diversity traits among individuals who were not diagnosed as autistic or who did not identify as gender diverse or transgender. There was a disparity in the timing of autism diagnosis between cisgender and gender-diverse individuals, with a 4- to 6-year delay among gender-diverse youth as compared to their cisgender peers. This delay created missed opportunities for early intervention, which was associated with a greater mental health burden and poorer quality of life. This was particularly challenging among transgender youth, who already faced significant stressors. One potential reason for the later diagnosis was that the social challenges could be misattributed to transgender identity, delaying referral for diagnosis and support. Another potential reason was related to the association between late diagnosis and higher verbal IQ status. Gender care providers had also observed a subset of transgender youth who appeared to be at the margin of an autism diagnosis, with notable social challenges only emerging during middle childhood and adolescence. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of the default mode network had shown differences in connectivity between autistic and non-autistic individuals. Dr. Strang’s research team found a stair-stepped pattern in neural connectivity, with non-autistic transgender youth showing the least connectivity, subclinical transgender youth showing more connectivity, and autistic transgender youth showing the most connectivity. Dr. Strang reviewed two theories for this finding: 1) there was a biological link between certain prenatal hormones and the likelihood of both autism and gender diversity, and 2) autistic people may be less driven by social gender norms. He noted that autistic transgender advocates called for a research focus on the needs of this community rather than an etiology. Dr. Strang said that it was important for researchers to consider the proportional overrepresentation of autism among gender-diverse communities, to identify personalized care approaches to meet their unique clinical needs, to characterize this overrepresentation—particularly in the interpretation of research findings, and to conduct longitudinal research on the impact of transgender limiting legislation. Discussion Dr. Kathleen Ethier reflected on the panel presentations, noting that: The quality and types of available data have improved over the last decade, which has benefited research on the SGM youth community. For instance, transgender identity data will be included for the first time in the 2023 YRBS, which will be released in August 2024. - It was not easy to change many data surveillance systems. For example, YRBS survey questions were decided by a balloting process through coordinators from all states. While this could protect the survey questions from being changed through political mechanisms, it could also limit the ability to include how young people identify themselves in a timely manner. There remained a need to include more comprehensive LGBTQ+ questions to include diverse identities and emerging issues. - Research efforts using existing data sources, such as the YRBS, the ABCD Study, or data from the Trevor Project survey, could provide valuable insights. Specifically, there was a need to address the societal impact of supportive and unsupportive policies on developmental and emotional outcomes among SGM youth. For example, YRBS data collected information about school policies and practices, which showed that schools with safe spaces for LGBTQ+ youth saw decreases in depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and attempts. - Dr. Ethier welcomed panelists to a Question and Answer session. Question: Is it getting better? Answers: Dr. Potter said there was a parallel between the YRBS school data and ABCD data analyzing anti-gender law policies across the state. About half of the students lived in states with negative laws, which was associated with higher rates of interpersonal violence, bullying, and harassment at school—not only among gender-diverse youth but among all youth. Dr. Ethier noted that the data showed that what was good for one group of youth was good for all and, conversely, what negatively impacted one group also negatively impacted all. This spoke to the interconnected nature of young people and demonstrated the broader impact of targeted policies. Dr. Olson-Kennedy said that the answer was yes and no. While understanding was improving and access to care was becoming more available, there was also pushback on care specifically for trans and non-binary youth. She noted that her team’s multisite R01 study had received nine FOIA requests, which took time and resources to respond to. Additionally, pediatric hospitals that offered youth care clinics were unprepared to take on the political challenges. For example, these hospitals were absorbing patients from other states, and there was not enough capacity to do so. Dr. Meyer said that things were getting better in terms of public attitudes around sexual orientation if not transgender issues. However, the lives of LGBTQ+ people were not necessarily getting better. It was important to consider microenvironments because policies did not penetrate the everyday lives of every person. Additionally, many religious organizations had a negative impact on LGBTQ+ people. It was important to remember that history did not bend towards justice but rather dueling forces. The advances of one side escalated the response of the other side. Question: How can clinicians and others working with LGBTQ+ youth translate research into practice? Answers: Dr. Matthews answered that the ability to assess common co-occurring needs and challenges, such as housing insecurity, could be addressed in clinical settings, and clinicians could prepare themselves to refer their patients to the right services. There were also ways to engage the community in conversations rather than just clinical assessments, which might make it easier for young people to share their challenges and feelings. There was also a lot of individual and community-level resiliency that could be leveraged and learned from to help clinicians when talking to young people. Dr. Strang added that it was important for clinicians to acknowledge the high disparity in access that LGBTQ+ people experienced. There were often waitlists of one to two years for those seeking a gender consultation—even in metropolitan areas. It could be idealistic to talk about the application of research into practice when there was still a crisis in access. Dr. Olson-Kennedy said that access to mental health services was also desperately needed, particularly in service deserts—not just among trans youth, but all youth. It was important to note that the population of youth needing these services was also increasing. Question: What could be done to promote more diverse activities in school environments? How would school initiatives that support LGBTQ+ youth impact the school environment more broadly? Answer: Dr. Ethier said that the CDC DASH had been making progress with LGBTQ+ youth in schools, but that arc of progress had changed in the last two years. Considering the youth mental health crisis at large, there was a need to call attention to how school-based LGBTQ+ laws and practices were doing harm to all young people. She hoped these policies would shift back to what the CDC knew was supportive, such as places for youth to gather and share their identities, accessible and identifiable safe adults, and policies against bullying and harassment. They had also heard that teachers and school staff can feel discrimination in schools with negative laws and practices. Some had even lost their jobs as a result. It was important to support not just the young people but also the adults. Question: Are there shifting expectations of what constitutes well-being in general? For example, younger LGBTQ+ individuals may have higher expectations for how they should be treated. Answer: Dr. Meyer said that the data indicated that it was not just about changing expectations but rather very serious, objective measures of health and well-being that were not being met by the education system. Suicide data on LGBTQ+ youth was a type of thermometer for progress, but the data had been disappointing. The problem was not about expectation gaps but of delivery gaps. Dr. Olson-Kennedy commented on the importance of social media and the ability of young people to connect and provide support for each other. Social media algorithms were always talked about as bad, but they could also be valuable for young people looking for community. In terms of schools, if there continued to be an erasing of progress, such as the availability of certain books, it would be problematic not just among LGBTQ+ youth but all youth. It was important to remember that anti-racism and broadening minds needed to be a built-in effort, not a tacked-on one. Social and Structural Determinants of Health: Community, Culture, and Policies Discussant: Brian Altman, J.D., (he/him), Director, National Mental Health and Substance Use Policy Laboratory, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Moderator: Crystal L. Barksdale, Ph.D., M.P.H., (she/her), Division of Community Health and Population Science, National Institute for Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) In Harm’s Way: Multilevel Stigma and Depression Among a National Sample of U.S. Black and Latino/x LGBTQ+ Adolescents Skyler Jackson, Ph.D., (he/him), Yale School of Public Health, Yale University Dr. Skylar Jackson talked about the significant mental health disparities experienced by LGBTQ+ adolescents. Although there had been a history of misattributing mental health disparities among LGBTQ+ individuals to their sexuality or gender identity as a pathology, today, there was a recognition that social stigma drives and sustains these disparities. Dr. Jackson talked about two major gaps in the literature. First, there was unequal attention to how different levels of stigma manifest to drive mental health disparities. Specifically, structural stigma, or the stigma rooted in discriminatory laws, policies, and oppressive norms, was given less attention than interpersonal stigma (everyday experiences of bias, discrimination, and bullying) and internalized stigma (negative societal attitudes internalized as homophobia or transphobia). Second, there was inadequate attention on how the intersection of multiple minority statuses could uniquely impact mental health. To address these gaps. Dr. Jackson’s team conducted a study of the effects of different forms of stigma on depression among Black and Latino/x LGBTQ+ individuals. The study used data from more than 2,500 participants aged 13 to 17 from the National Survey on LGBTQ+ Young People. They found that more racial/ethnic bullying and sexual orientation bullying (both considered forms of interpersonal stigma) were associated with higher odds of recent depression. However, those who experienced both forms of bullying were nearly 2.5 times more likely to have experienced recent depression than those who experienced neither form of bullying. Next, they sought to develop a state-level structural stigma index for LGBTQ+, using seven different areas of protective or harmful state-level policies that informed a composite index score. They found that Black and Latino/x LGBTW+ adolescents who lived in the most stigmatizing states had a 32 percent greater likelihood of recent depression. Dr. Jackson noted that the data used for the index was from 2017 and that there had been an increasing number of harmful state-level policies in some states since then. As of last week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) was tracking more than 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills across states. >Latinx LGBTQ+ Youth and Their Families and Communities: Contextualizing the Role of Cultural Values and Traditions Roberto L. Abreu, Ph.D., (he/him/él), Department of Psychology, University of Florida Dr. Roberto Abreu talked about the role of cultural values and traditions in the interactions between Latinx youth and their families. He underscored the necessity of understanding these cultural nuances in research rather than viewing all LGBTQ+ individuals and their family relationships as homogeneous. Research showed that family acceptance of LGBTQ+ youth leads to positive outcomes such as positive identity development, higher self-esteem, and better mental health outcomes. Conversely, more rejection leads to higher substance use, more sexual risk-taking, and internalized stigma. However, most research looked at the experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals and their white mothers. Very little was known about their relationships with fathers, and even less was known about the experiences of families of color. Studies that do consider families of color often compared them to their white counterparts rather than capturing their unique culture and traditions. Dr. Abreu explained that this research focus created a narrative that communities of color were more homophobic, transphobic, and biphobic—presenting white communities and white families as safer and more accepting. He conducted a series of qualitative and quantitative studies to fill this research gap. He found that family support and harmony were nuanced, involving complex family dynamics. Traditional gender norms, such as machismo and family loyalty, played a significant role in how families interacted with their LGBTQ+ children, and reframing those norms within a cultural context could help families accept their LGBTQ+ children. Respect for elders, dignity, religion, and spirituality were other key cultural factors in family acceptance. Families could embrace, reject, or reframe their beliefs to support their LGBTQ+ children. Dr. Abreu’s research emphasized that parental and family acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals was not universal and that cultural values and traditions significantly influenced these relationships. He advocated for culturally specific interventions and future research to further explore how different cultural values could interact with systems of oppression to impact the mental health of LGBTQ+ youth. Mental Health Needs of LGBTQ+ Youth Involved in the Criminal Legal System Jane Hereth, Ph.D., (she/they), University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee Dr. Jane Hereth highlighted the overrepresentation of LGBTQ+ youth in the criminal legal system and the negative mental health impacts that result from this involvement. She noted that while approximately 9 percent of youth in the U.S. identified as LGBTQ+, 20 percent of youth within the juvenile justice system identified as LGBTQ+ and gender nonconforming. Further, 85 percent of LGBTQ+ and gender nonconforming youth in the criminal legal systems were youth of color. Once inside the system, these youth often faced a range of adverse outcomes and traumatic experiences. They encountered discrimination and bias at multiple levels—including police, lawyers, judges, facility staff, and other youth. This discrimination led to increased surveillance, harsher sentences, and worse treatment—all of which significantly impacted their mental health. Once inside, these youth were often hypervisible, segregated, and routinely denied gender-affirming and other health care. Dr. Hereth talked about three pathways to the criminal legal system: the criminalization of LGTBQ+ individuals, the school-to-prison pathway, and criminalized survival. In terms of the criminalization of LGBTQ+, bias and stigma contributed to perceptions that LGBTQ+ were deviant, resulting in laws targeting LGBTQ+ communities, increased surveillance, and unjustified arrests. This, in turn, led to an inherent mistrust of police and the legal system among LGBTQ+ youth. The school-to-prison pathway describes the direct and indirect impact of policies that push students out of school and into the criminal legal system. School policies such as zero-tolerance and police presence contributed to disproportionate rates of detention, suspension, and expulsion, particularly among LGBTQ+ youth of color. This led to an avoidance of school, conflicts at home, involvement in the child welfare system, and eventually homelessness. Criminalized survival described behaviors such as theft, panhandling, and sex work that were needed to survive family rejection, homelessness, unemployment, poverty, and discrimination. Dr. Hereth noted that, despite these adverse experiences, LGBTQ+ youth were incredibly resilient but should not have to be to survive. Interventions along the three pathways were needed to keep these youths from involvement in the criminal legal system in the first place. These interventions could include increasing LGBTQ+ affirming practices and services across all contexts (i.e., mental health services, schools, the child welfare system), as well as holding the criminal legal system accountable for bias and victimization. Individuals could resist anti-LGBTQ+ policies, whether locally in schools or nationally in elections. Youth with Diverse SOGIE and Public Systems Involvement: Research/Practice Gaps and Opportunities. Dana Prince, Ph.D., (she/her), Case Western University Dr. Dana Prince presented on suicide risk among SOGIE youth who were involved in the child welfare system. There was a well-documented heightened risk of suicidal thoughts, behaviors, attempts, and deaths among SOGIE youth. SOGIE youth were also more likely to enter the child welfare system, have more placements within an episode of care, and have more episodes of care than their heterosexual and cisgender peers. SOGIE youth were also more likely to have adverse outcomes upon exiting care and lower reunification rates with their families of origin. Between 16 and 32 percent of youth in child welfare or juvenile justice systems were SOGIE. Regardless of sexual identity or gender identity, 25 percent of individuals involved in foster care or juvenile court reported lifetime suicidal ideation—double that of their non-involved peers. They were also at three times greater risk for suicide planning, attempt, and death. There had also been an alarming trend in increased suicide attempts among Black boys and the fastest increase in suicide behaviors among Black girls. Therefore, Dr. Prince focused her research on the nexus of being LGBTQ+ and being involved in child welfare or juvenile court with suicide risk. She highlighted the complex interplay of factors that led to the overrepresentation of SOGIE youth in the child welfare system, underscored by three drivers: harmful policies and practices, abuse and neglect, and familial rejection. She talked about the reinforcing loop of being “hard to place,” which involved a greater likelihood of being placed in restrictive care settings such as group homes or residential treatment facilities or rejection from lower care settings such as foster homes back into more restrictive settings. Dr. Prince spoke about a demonstration project in Cuyahoga County aimed at transforming child welfare practices to support SOGIE youth. Central to the project was safe identification, which ensured that the appropriate questions were being asked to accurately identify SOGIE at risk of suicide. With safe identification, they were able to identify 20 percent of SOGIE youth entering child welfare, as compared to 3 percent before safe identification. In addition to safe identification, the project promoted coordinated mental health referrals to affirming peer support—that is, individuals with lived experiences as SOGIE youth who had overcome their suicidal ideation. Dr. Prince emphasized the need for systemic changes to address the unique challenges of SOGIE in the child welfare system, as well as the need to use community assets and peers to improve outcomes among this vulnerable population. State Policy, School Environments, and the Mental Health of LGBTQ+ Youth Kerith Conron, Sc.D., (she/her), Williams Institute, UCLA School of Law Dr. Kerith Conron made a call for action to understand and address the impact of public policies on LGBTQ+ youth in high school—a particularly vulnerable group because of their dependence on parents and compulsory school attendance. When given a choice, LGBTQ+ individuals will seek more supportive environments. For example, LGBTQ+ individuals were four times more likely to choose a four-year college in a more supportive state than their non-LGBTQ+ peers. However, high school students did not have that choice, making it critical for high schools to provide a safe space to learn. Over the years, there had been changes in the number of both protective and harmful laws that impacted LGBTQ+ high school students. On the positive side, 21 states had anti-bullying laws that protected LGBTQ+ youth, which had been shown to improve mental health and reduce suicide risk. On the negative side, seven states banned any discussion about LGBTQ+ people or issues, enacted restrictions on LGBTQ+ curricula, and banned the use of gender identity pronouns. Eight states passed parental notification laws that would out trans students to their parents. Dr. Conron talked about a study using 2021 Access to Higher Education survey data. Among the 18- to 24-year olds who were asked to look back to their high school years, more LGBTQ+ than non-LGBTQ+ people experienced depression, anxiety, bullying, and sexual harassment and assault. Fewer LGBTQ+ than non-LGBTQ+ people reported feeling a sense of belonging, and very few reported the presence of a gay-straight alliance. Dr. Conron noted the importance of not only monitoring bullying and sexual assault experiences but also the perpetrators and contexts involved in order to make high schools safer. There was also a need to monitor high schools broadly and robustly to have a dataset large enough to study the impact of public policies. She also expressed gratitude for the inclusion of a question about ACEs in the YRBS and called for those questions to also be included in state core surveys to assess the effects of policy environments and school climates on student mental health. She advocated for large-scale studies to assess the impact of both protective and harmful policies and stressed the importance of developing effective anti-bullying strategies and promoting socio-emotional competencies. “It Makes me Feel Hopeless”: Anti-Trans Policies and the Mental Health of Gender Diverse Youth Megan Pacely, Ph.D., (they/them), University of Connecticut Spencer Evans, L.M.S.W., (she/her), University of Connecticut Ms. Spencer Evans discussed the state of research on state-level legislation and its impact on LGBTQ+ youth. Since 2021, there had been an onslaught of anti-trans legislation in states across the U.S. Starting in 2021, 125 proposed state policies aimed to limit access to affirming school and healthcare support for transgender and LGBTQ+ youth. By the first half of 2024, more than 600 proposed bills across 42 states had impacted nearly 300,000 young people. Notably, Florida was the only state to receive a do-not-travel designation due to laws that allowed for the arrest of transgender people who use bathrooms associated with their gender identity and not their sex assigned at birth. Other legislation aimed to restrict access to gender-affirming care for minors, name and gender changes, use of gender-specific places, and sports involvement on gendered teams. Some legislation required public institutions to inform parents of their child’s pronoun or name changes at school and mandated the use of names and pronouns assigned at birth. Dr. Pacely talked about the dearth of research on the impact of these policies on LGBTQ+ youth. One study from The Trevor Project that used data from early 2021 found that LGBTQ+ youth reported significant impacts of legislation on their mental health and well-being. Nearly half of families with trans youth considered moving to a different state. In a follow-on study that aimed to quickly understand the impact of the rapidly-shifting legislation, three themes emerged from focus group discussions: 1) perceived impacts on mental health—with participants expressing feelings of sadness and hopelessness, 2) structural supports—such as increased barriers to affirming care and decreased access to safety, and 3) messages they wanted to share with policymakers. Dr. Pacely presented some of the voices of lived experience as examples of the impact these policies had on daily lives. They also talked about the importance of engaging youth as research partners throughout the process. Dr. Pacely emphasized that the harm was not only a result of policies but also the rhetoric and stigma associated with the proposed legislation. They called for more research in this area, particularly cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, and an examination of the decision-making processes for families in high-risk states. They also recommended research on how medical and mental health providers support trans and LGBTQ+ youth in light of these policies and increased funding opportunities to support these studies. Discussion Mr. Brian Altman reflected on the presentations and recent federal actions, noting that: The higher rates of behavioral health conditions among LGBTQ+ youth were related to the stigma, discrimination, bullying, and harassment associated with their identities. - The 988 Suicide & Crisis Line had a line dedicated to LGBTQ+ people, who could text PRIDE to 988 to receive specialized services. - More research was needed to understand and address the underlying factors that impacted mental health and well-being among LGBTQ+ people. - Because family acceptance and support were key, SAMHSA launched a grant opportunity focused on LGBTQ+ family support. - Interpersonal interactions were compounded by structural stigma driven by anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ+ legislation. Structural factors were also involved in the disproportionate number of LGBTQ+ youth in child welfare and juvenile justice systems. - The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) recently released a Designated Placements rule that child welfare and foster care systems must provide LGBTQ+ youth with a placement that is supportive and affirming. - CDC recommended that the stigma and discrimination that LGBTQ+ youth experience should be considered ACEs. - SAMHSA did not use the term conversion therapy but rather sexual orientation and gender identity change efforts. Aligned with this language, SAMHSA released the Moving Beyond Change Efforts, which outlined an evidence-based roadmap for supporting and affirming LGBTQ+ youth. - Further research was needed on policy environments, cultural norms, anti-LGTBQ+ rhetoric, and the intersection of systems and identities. - Mr. Altman invited panelists to participate in a Question and Answer session. Question: Compounding stigma is harder for those who are disabled, Two Spirit, and LGBTQI+. How can the experiences and impacts on multiple stigmatized identities be addressed? Answer: Dr. Prince talked about NIH’s recent move toward the inclusion of more disability research, which was shaped by people with disabilities, disability leaders, and activities, as well as intersectional oppression. It was important to consider the queer disability culture and how it could inform how to share resources and care for one another. There was also an opportunity to recognize that disability involved multiple cultures, not just a single checked box. Dr. Conron added that investigators with R01s should encourage students with disabilities and other identities to write supplemental grants for smaller projects within the R01 mechanism. Question: Are there more opportunities to apply for family support grants? Answer: Mr. Altman answered that the open competition ran last spring and summer. SAMHSA received 53 applications, but only had funding for four grants. SAMHSA later found additional funding to support another four grants, but no additional funding was available at this time to post a new notice of funding opportunity. Panel Discussion with Youth-Serving Organizations Moderator/Discussant: Tamar Mendelson, Ph.D., (she/her), Bloomberg Professor of American Health, Director for the Center for Adolescent Health, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University Moderator: Stacia Friedman-Hill, Ph.D., (she/they), Division of Translational Research, National Institute of Mental Health Advocates for Youth Louie Ortiz-Fonseca, M.A., (he/they), Director, LGBTQ Health & Rights Sebas Abbate, (they/she/he/ella), LGBTQ+ Youth Activist, YouthResource Council Mx. Louie Ortiz-Fonseca said that Advocates for Youth was primarily known for championing to ensure that all young people had access to affirming, factual, inclusive sex education. They worked with community-based organizations, organizing groups, national organizations, and a collective of youth activist cohorts/councils. Some youth activist cohorts included Young Women of Color 4 Reproductive Justice Collective, Muslim Youth Leadership Council, Engaging Communities Around HIV Organizing (ECHO), and YouthResource Leadership Council. Mx. Sebas Abbate talked about their experience as a cohort member of Youth Resource, which worked with young people on HIV prevention. They also hosted their young adult program, providing a safe social space, and a sexual health and education program called Pride and Pleasure. Mx. Abbate talked about their work in the context of living in Florida and the need for safe spaces. Human Rights Campaign Ted Lewis, M.Ed., (they/them), Director of Youth Well-Being Kei Smith, (she/they), Human Rights Campaign Youth Ambassador Mx. Ted Lewis said that the 501(c)4 entity of the Human Rights Campaign conducted political organizing to help pro-equality officials get elected. The 501(c)3 entity worked on education and advocacy for LGBTQ+ communities, with several programs focused on youth and young adults. They also had a Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HCBU) initiative and an All Children – All Families program that worked on child welfare and foster care systems. Some of their new initiatives included their Economic Empowerment Programs, including Next Level, which supported young adults around financial wellness and job readiness. They also conduct a survey every five years in collaboration with the University of Connecticut, which provides them with data on LGBTQ+ youth across the country. Youth Ambassadors were another important part of their program. Mx. Kei Smith talked about her experience in the Youth Ambassador program, a group of youth activists who worked in their communities and with other Youth Ambassadors to pool resources and ideas. It Gets Better Justin Tindall, (he/they), Senior Director, Programs and Operations Rae Sweet, (they/them), Senior Coordinator, Education Alejandro Jiménez de Ferry, (he/him), It Gets Better Alumnus Mx. Justin Tindall said that the mission of It Gets Better was to uplift, empower, and connect LGBTQ+ youth around the globe through storytelling and community building. It Gets Better was best known for its digital storytelling, which provided positive messages of hope from members of their community and helped them navigate the current environment. They also had a program called 50 States. 50 Grants. 5,000 Voices., which distributed grants of up to $10,000 to schools across the U.S. The program had distributed more than $1 million over the last two years. They also recently launched Queerbook, a compilation of poetry, art, photography, and other elements. Mx. Rae Sweet talked about their community engagement in schools and resources that educators could use to bring their stories into the core standards for classrooms. One of their programs was Youth Voices, a group of LGTBQ+ youth who attend skill-building workshops to help build their confidence in storytelling and connect them with opportunities to tell their stories to the public. Mr. Alejandro Jiménez de Ferry said that participating in It Gets Better was one of the highlights of his high school career because it was the first time in his life that someone like him was able to tell his story. He also contributed to the Queerbook. He noted that there were a number of Latin American chapters of It Gets Better across the world for Spanish speakers. True Colors United Aleya Jones, M.Ed., (she/her), Senior Policy Officer Ms. Aleya Jones said that True Colors United implemented innovative solutions to youth homelessness by focusing on the experiences of those who were most impacted—LGBTQ+ and BIPOC youth. One of their activities focused on ending youth homelessness, led by a group of young people who contributed to the national dialogue on how to make youth homelessness rare, brief, and non-reoccurring. This ensured that the conversation was informed and filtered through the perspectives of young people who experienced homelessness. Another activity was their state-based work advocating against the rampant anti-LGBTQ+ and anti-trans legislation, focusing particularly on the dangerous trends impacting youth and young adults. Discussion Dr. Tamar Mendelson invited the panelists to a Question and Answer session. Question: There has been a lot of discussion about the challenges that LGBTQ+ youth face right now. What about the sources of joy? Answer: Mr. Jiménez de Ferry said that queer media was at an all-time high and provided examples such as the movie Bottoms which had representation of queer and women of color, as well as performing artists such as Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, and Reneé Rapp. It had been eye-opening to discover how many queer celebrities there were, and it made him wonder what the future held with so many trailblazers forging a path for others. Mx. Smith added that they found queer joy through solidarity between communities. For instance, they worked at a domestic violence organization for Asian American women and trans people, which largely catered to cis-gendered women but had also been reaching out to queer people in the Asian community. There had been a large shift toward creating spaces for intersectionality in general. Although there was a lot of depressing news, there was also a lot of good work happening. Mx. Tindall talked about a research study showing that a greater percentage of children and young adult books had an animal as the protagonist than an LGTBQ+ person. However, this was rapidly changing. They had also been hearing from young people that there were now spaces where they felt safe to be themselves, such as table gaming, crafting, and photography. It was a silver lining to the legislative attacks—despite the negative rhetoric, LGBTQ+ youth were finding spaces where they could thrive and connect with others like them. This was radically different from the experiences of previous generations. Mx. Abbate echoed that there were more in-person gatherings and safe spaces that have been bringing them joy. A lot of the youth they work with did not come from safe homes, and it had been important to provide them with spaces to be themselves without worrying about family or protestors. Pride Month also provided a lot of opportunities for safe spaces, even in Florida. It was also very important that the spaces were created by the youth in order not to feel like they were being catered to with pink-washing or queer-capitalism. Ms. Jones talked about the idea of “collective care,” which involved leaning on each other to find different supports and resources. There was a sense of obligation in the community to not only check on oneself, but also other people. Collective care meant that people did not have to go through it alone. Although society tended to be very individualistic, it was important to uplift the message that people could get through the challenges collectively. Question: From your organization’s perspective, how are you seeing LGBTQ+ youth contributing to their communities? Answer: Mx. Ortiz-Fonseca answered that there had always been a certain kind of young person who was elevated or provided a space at the table, but there was a question of what they could do to move things and be taken seriously. This had changed with the advent of social media. The LGBTQ+ culture had been reminded of its Black roots and had a space to be unapologetically Black without having to code-switch to gain space at the table. It had helped expand the conversation about what it was like to be queer beyond coming out. Mx. Ortiz-Fonseca spoke about being a young person who had always wanted conversations about mental health and growing up with parents with addictions. While that was not a conversation that could be had in the 90s, it was a conversation that was happening now. The conversation was about the experience of an LGBTQ+ young person, particularly among those of color, as a whole or a sum of their parts. They added that young people had developed toolkits about how to divest from policy and invest in sex education. It was important to amplify and expand the work the young people accomplished while also supporting their emotional and mental health. Their organization did not provide a direct service, but they still felt a responsibility to support their young leaders. This could mean providing workshops on protest safety or aid to those who had lost their jobs. Community care was foundational to LGBTQ+ identity. Mx. Tindall agreed and added that adults who worked in major institutions tended to think they had the answers about what was best for LGBTQ+ youth, but this was not always the case. Great intentions did not always lead to great success. The most success they had seen was when they handed the mic or the reins over to the youth. It was important not to prescribe what a community needed with grant funding, for instance, but rather to ask the community what they needed to make school environments more welcoming. It was critical to truly listen and believe the youth knew what was needed to make a program successful. They encouraged researchers to work with LGBTQ+ youth, take the time to listen, and learn and grow from what they had to share. Mx. Sweet talked about the LGBTQ+ youth who contacted It Gets Better to become a youth voice, expressing interest in making a TikTok, writing a blog post, contributing to Queerbook, or applying for a grant, for instance. They had also seen young people testify in public hearings and speak at rallies. There had been so much energy, passion, dedication, and fearlessness that it was incredible to see in light of what was happening politically. Mx. Lewis said that it was easy to forget that goalposts moved with progress. For instance, older generations never thought they would see same-sex couples getting married. However, this was a reality for younger generations, and that particular goalpost was well behind them. Therefore, touting that as progress was not helpful for LGBTQ+ youth of today, particularly in states such as Florida, Texas, and Tennessee. It was helpful for older generations who had been working in this movement for a while to recognize that past victories did not always impact the lived experiences of young people. It was also important to recognize that living in a hostile state often came with a certain level of resistance that young people often did not understand. A young person could post on TikTok and reach millions of people. Their voices had a way to reach places people could not before, and sharing their experiences and inviting others to share their experiences made a huge difference. Mx. Lewis noted that many parents had mentioned being able to understand their child who had come out because someone else in the neighborhood already had. Youth could be role models for each other, often more so than adults. Simply being out and proud in a hostile state was a form of resistance. Even small things, such as wearing a pronoun pin or displaying pronouns on a TikTok profile, mattered. Mx. Tindall added that society often thought of queer issues as adult issues. Therefore, a lot of the attacks had focused on adults, whether through housing or job discrimination or attacks against marriage equality. However, more young people were coming forward, sharing their stories and perspectives, and talking about what they needed and wanted. The attacks were now focused on young people, somewhat like retribution for speaking up when they had previously been an invisible subpopulation. As unfortunate as that was, these young people were resilient, determined, passionate, and energetic. They were not going to let up, even if the attacks continued. They were making a difference in their communities. Question: How do your organizations work with others to amplify and coordinate efforts to strengthen collective impact? Answer: Mx. Lewis said that the Human Rights Campaign did not have the best record of partnering, in part because of the way the nonprofit industrial complex worked. It could be difficult to partner while still carving out one’s space, finding funding and resources, and paying people to do the work. These were real hurdles in collective work, particularly when these organizations were often underfunded, under-resourced, and understaffed. However, because of the political landscape, there were some opportunities to partner with organizations that were not directly working with LGBTQ+ youth to meet the needs of the moment. For example, the Human Rights Campaign had an initiative called Project Thrive that worked with more than 40 national partners that had pledged to help LGBTQ+ youth thrive. Some were large organizations such as the National Association of Social Workers, the National Education Association, the American Medical Association, Big Brothers, and Big Sisters. There were opportunities to approach these mainstream organizations and ask them to dedicate resources, time, and collateral to help uplift LGBTQ+ youth. LGBTQ+ organizations often heard from others that their work was biased or progressive. When other industries spoke up, it helped with legislation. When people in mental health or physical health professions talked about the harms caused by denying gender-affirming care, for instance, it could go a long way toward turning the tide. Mx. Smith said that it was important for nonprofits to recognize that there were youth who were organizing grassroots work and that they were successful in making connections and pooling resources. Youth were really good at building communities, and that was something that nonprofits and large institutions could learn from. Mx. Sweet agreed and added that partnerships helped to fill gaps in organizations that were underresourced and understaffed. For example, It Gets Better partnered with the Hope Lab to connect them with participants in their Youth Voices to help them create a digital mental health resource for LGBTQ+ youth (imi.guide). Another example was an organization called No Filter, which was creating resources for safe online activities for youth. It Gets Better connected them with their youth cohorts to help them create a guide on being safe online as an LGBTQ+ person. It Gets Better also collaborated with corporate partners for career days. Mx. Ortiz-Fonseca said that everything outward-facing that Advocates for Youth created had to be reviewed by young people. Knowing this helped them consider partners that made the most sense because some things were not in their wheelhouse. For example, mutual aid was not something they could do, but they could pass it off to another organization. It was important that young people served as a guide, deciding what was important for them rather than being told what to do in their community. Mx. Abbate said it was helpful to have partnerships to expand into the national or digital spaces. It could be limiting to work in a space that was specific to a county or physical space. There could be times when youths wanted to serve, but they were one city too far away. Having national platforms such as HIV/AIDS Awareness Days could help voices reach the ears of those who needed the messages. That amplification was something that could be challenging to do in a small organization. Question: This workshop is sponsored by NIH, a research organization. What kinds of research questions and data do you wish researchers had that would impact your work? Answer: Ms. Jones talked about the trends they had seen among SGM youth. For example, there was a lack of comfort and safety that unhoused LGBTQ+ youth faced because many youth shelters were homophobic. In particular, faith-based shelters could be very discriminatory against the trans community. Another trend was the deaths of Black trans youth. It was vital to acknowledge their need to be protected and the violence eliminated. It would also be important to understand what was happening at the state level in terms of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation and how that impacted young people. However, it was not enough to collect quantitative data. It was also important to collect qualitative data—stories to amplify the numbers and let young people use their voices to explain how it felt to be going to school in these times. Mx. Abbate added that a lot of HIV and safer sex studies did not include the voices of trans-masculine people. Cisgendered women who were in these studies had very different experiences than trans-masculine people. Trans-feminine people had different experiences than cisgender men. The companies doing this research might say that the population was too hard to find, but it was important to find them because they wanted their experiences to be represented and to have safer sexual lives. Mx. Abbate suggested that researchers partner with LGBTQ+ organizations to create that bridge. Mx. Lewis asked researchers to make their study accessible to the public. Too often, these studies were behind paywalls, and organizations often used their college interns to access the articles. It was also important to translate 500-page research reports into something accessible, such as an infographic or a top line. Mx. Tindall talked about their work on an advisory committee for Equality California and their Safe and Supportive Schools Report Card, which reported on how well districts in the state were performing in terms of support for LGBTQ+ students. However, that survey was completed by adults who talked about the policies that were in place. If they were to instead ask the LGBTQ+ students whether the policies actually reached them, their answer would likely be “no.” Therefore, researchers should include more perspectives from young people, including recommendations for solutions that accompany the research. Concluding Remarks Beshaun Davis, Ph.D., (he/him), Office for Disparities Research and Workforce Diversity, NIMH Dr. Beshaun Davis thanked the panelists and attendees for their participation and expressed gratitude for learning about all the work being done. He noted some key takeaways he had from the panel presentations, including: Programs targeted toward improving the mental health and safety of LGBTQ+ students also improved the mental health of all students. - Despite historical progress, the goalposts had changed, and there were many needs that were not being addressed by current mental healthcare systems. - Systems such as child welfare services could put LGBTQ+ youth at a disadvantage, and this challenge was not being fully addressed. - There was a critical need for community-engaged research approaches that centered on the perspectives of LGBTQ+ youth. - There were many organizations working to empower young people and amplify their voices. This helped to not only focus on a deficit perspective, but also a strengths perspective that leveraged the ability of youth to form communities, share their experiences on media platforms, and have a positive impact on their communities. - Day 2: Welcome Irene Avila, Ph.D., (she/her/ella), Assistant Director, Sexual & Gender Minority Research Office, NIH Alison Cernich, Ph.D., (she/her), Deputy Director, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Helene M. Langevin, M.D., (she/her), Director, National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) Dr. Alison Cernich discussed NICHD’s mission to understand human development and improve the lives of children and adolescents, including those with diverse gender and sexual identities. She highlighted the critical need to address the significant mental health disparities that SGM youth face, such as higher rates of depression, anxiety, substance use, and suicide—which was driven by discrimination, stigma, social and structural barriers, and a lack of access to culturally competent care. Dr. Cernich called for accurate and inclusive measures of sexual orientation and gender, research on developmental factors impacting the mental health of SGM youth and evidence-based strategies. She acknowledged the challenges in conducting research with minors and advocated for their inclusion. NICHD’s Population Dynamics Branch supported research on improving sexual orientation and gender identity measures, developing inclusive educational curricula, and preventing dating and relationship violence. NICHD also supported research on factors that influenced youth mental health, such as the stress of the pandemic, cyberbullying, dissatisfaction with family relationships, and unmet medical needs. Dr. Cernich expressed appreciation to the organizers and panelists for making this important workshop happen. Dr. Helene Langevin expressed gratitude for the opportunity for NCCIH to collaborate with NIMH in this workshop. She noted that the workshop aims aligned with the NCCIH strategic plan, which emphasized research on complementary health to address health disparities and advance emotional wellbeing. One of NCCIH’s key priorities was whole-person health, which considered interconnected body systems, including biological, behavioral, social, and environmental domains. Dr. Langevin underscored the importance of multi-component and preventive interventions that reduce risk and enhance protective factors. She concluded by highlighting two NCCIH funding opportunities. One opportunity evaluated mindful self-compassion among SGM young adults, who often experience gender dysphoria and distress resulting from an incongruence between one’s body and identity. The other opportunity was to develop internet-delivered mindfulness interventions to reduce HIV risk and promote mental and sexual health among young men who have sex with men (MSM). Community Engaged Research Discussant: Terrinieka Powell, Ph.D., (she/her), Associate Professor and Vice Chair for Inclusion, Diversity, Anti-Racism and Equity, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University Moderator: Christopher Barnhart, Ph.D., (he/him and they/them), Sexual and Gender Minority Research Office, NIH TransHealthGUIDE: Transforming Health for Gender Diverse Young Adults Using Interventions to Drive Equity Sari Reisner, Sc.D., M.A., (he/him), School of Public Health, University of Michigan Dr. Sari Reisner provided an overview of the community-engaged component of an intervention study that sought to address the significant mental health burden experienced by transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) young people. One of the study components was a free online course to improve provider competencies in addressing TGD youth mental health needs by enhancing their knowledge, attitudes, and communication skills. The second intervention component was an interactive digital platform that provided education on how to promote communication and strengthen relationships between TGD young people and their caregivers. Dr. Reisner and his team leveraged extensive community engagement throughout the research process, including an advisory board of TGD youth and their caregivers, an advisory board of caregivers and providers of SGM young people, and consultations with key stakeholders that served TGD young people. These community members helped assess needs, develop content, and identify potential barriers and facilitators of success in the study. The community engagement also included survey results from 104 TGD young people enrolled in the study and 33 in-depth interviews with TGD young people, caregivers, and providers. The survey showed that 42 percent of TGD young people screened positive for elevated depressive symptoms. Low family support was the strongest correlate with depression, with a 70 percent higher prevalence of depression among TGD young people with low family support than those with high family support. The survey also indicated that TGD young people preferred information about gender and health primarily from trans peers, with a little more than half seeking information from medical professionals. TGD youth also preferred information from YouTube and Reddit, followed by Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram. The in-depth interviews with caregivers showed three main themes: 1) navigating relationships with self—in which caregivers expressed feelings of loss and worry about the young person’s changing identity, 2) negotiating relationships with others—which involved the process of disclosing their TGD young person’s identity to extended family and social networks, and 3) educating themselves and others through relationships—which highlighted the importance of connecting through personal narratives with other caregivers to help better support their TGD young person. The interviews also emphasized the importance of linking with other caregivers, educating themselves, and learning how to become an advocate. The lessons learned from this community engagement informed the development of the intervention components, which incorporated interactive elements such as simulation videos and role-playing. Dr. Reisner underscored the importance of including community voices in research, particularly in light of the passage of several policies that limited healthcare access for TGD young people. An Intersectional Community Engaged Approach to Conducting Mental Health Research with Latine/x LGBTQ+ Youth Communities John P. Salerno, Ph.D., M.P.H., (he/him/él), School of Social Work, Columbia University Dr. John P. Salerno highlighted the mental health disparities experienced by Latine/x LGBTQ+ youth communities. He began by presenting data from the Trevor Project, showing that Latine/x LGBTQ+ youth exhibit higher rates of depression and suicidal ideation compared to their LGBTQ+ peers despite a general decline in symptoms from 2021 to 2023. Dr. Salerno pointed out several challenges in addressing these mental health issues, including an overreliance on the health disparities framework, cultural explanations that mask structural factors, and a lack of community-engaged studies. He emphasized the importance of using an intersectionality framework to understand the complex experiences of Latine/x LGBTQ+ youth and to identify the structural factors driving mental health disparities. Dr. Salerno advocated for community-engaged research, in which community members participated in various phases of the research process—from study development to dissemination of findings. He illustrated this approach through an example of the LGBTQ+ Students and Allies in Public Health student organization at the University of Maryland. This group conducted a national survey on minority stress and mental health among LGBTQ+ college students, actively involving students in all research phases. The study found significant associations between minority stressors such as internalized LGBTQ+ phobia, family rejection, victimization, and high levels of psychological distress, underscoring the need for interventions to reduce minority stress on college campuses. The second study examined the impact of racist microaggressions and LGBTQ+ minority stressors on Latine/x LGBTQ+ college students. It found that racist microaggressions were significantly associated with psychological distress, highlighting the insufficiency of the sexual and gender minority stress framework alone to explain the mental health challenges faced by Latine/x LGBTQ+ youth. Dr. Salerno concluded by calling for new research frameworks and the use of community-engaged research methods to better understand and address the intersectional experiences of these populations, ultimately aiming for social justice outcomes tailored to the community’s specific needs. Theory-to-Practice in Community-Engaged Research: Intersectional, Feminist, Womanist, and Liberatory Approaches Annaliese Singh, Ph.D., L.P.C., (she/they), School of Social Work, Tulane University Dr. Annaliese Singh highlighted the importance of cultural humility in research, particularly when working with queer and trans youth. She emphasized that researchers often overlooked the personal motivations behind their studies and the theoretical frameworks guiding them. Dr. Singh shared her experiences working with LGBTQIA+ youth, underscoring the transformative impact of engaging authentically with these communities. She advocated for recognizing the potential for liberation in research practices and stressed the importance of framing research in ways that genuinely reflect the voices and needs of young people. Dr. Singh discussed three key projects: the Georgia Safe Schools Coalition, Project Affirm, and the Trans Resilience Project. The Georgia Safe Schools Coalition, founded in 2009, utilized intersectionality theory to address bullying and discrimination in schools. The project involved deep listening and dialogue with various school stakeholders, leading to the creation of authentic partnerships defined by the voices of queer and trans young people. Project Affirm, an NIH-funded longitudinal study, explored trans identity development and resilience using innovative methodologies like the lifeline protocol, for which participants mapped significant life events related to their gender identity. This approach highlighted the importance of involving participants as co-creators of theory and data. In the Trans Resilience Project, Dr. Singh applied mutual aid theory to research, focusing on the socio-political context affecting queer and trans youth. This project aimed to put research findings directly into the hands of the communities being studied, ensuring that young people could influence and shape the research process. Dr. Singh concluded with a call for researchers to embrace liberatory and intersectional approaches, listen deeply to the communities they serve, and consider the broader implications of their work for societal change. This emphasis on community-engaged research aligned with the NIMH’s goals of promoting mental health and well-being for SGM youth. Pride & Community Connection for Indigenous 2SLGBTQ+ Youth: the Intersectionality of Identity for Indigenous Adolescents in the US Alessandra Angelino, M.D., M.P.H., F.A.A.P., Division of Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine, Center for Indigenous Health, Johns Hopkins University Dr. Alessandra Angelino highlighted the unique challenges and strengths of Indigenous 2SLGBTQ+ youth. Dr. Angelino began by acknowledging the historical and ongoing systemic inequities faced by Indigenous peoples in the U.S., calling for reconciliation and greater inclusion of Indigenous youth in various efforts. She explained the term Two Spirit, a unifying identity for American Indian, Alaska Native, and First Nation individuals that transcended Western binary gender concepts and historically celebrated gender diversity in Indigenous communities. The research focused on the impact of pride and community connection on health outcomes for Two Spirit and Indigenous 2SLGBTQ+ youth, who faced significant barriers to healthcare due to systemic inequities rooted in historical trauma and colonization. Dr. Angelino's team utilized a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative data and in-depth qualitative interviews to explore youth experiences. The study, conducted with the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board, recruited participants through social media and text outreach. The results showed strong pride in Two Spirit and Indigenous identities, although gender-diverse individuals reported lower levels of community and family support—particularly among younger adolescents. Key findings from the research highlighted the protective role of cultural connection and community support in promoting mental and physical wellness among Indigenous 2SLGBTQ+ youth. The research underscored the importance of culturally safe resources and traditional practices in supporting these individuals. Dr. Angelino emphasized the need for healthcare providers to recognize and incorporate Indigenous communities' historical context and cultural practices into their care. Recommendations included increasing the representation and involvement of Two Spirit individuals in research and policy development and leveraging community strengths to foster resilience and better health outcomes for Indigenous 2SLGBTQ+ youth. Engaging SGM Youth in Clinical Trial Research: Advancing their Roles as Interventionists José Arturo Bauermeister, Ph.D., M.P.H., F.S.B.M., (he/him), University of Pennsylvania Dr. José Arturo Bauermeister focused on innovative approaches to involving SGM youth in clinical research. He highlighted the potential of these youth to serve as interventionists, drawing on their lived experiences and expertise to enhance the relevance and effectiveness of clinical trials. Dr. Bauermeister emphasized the importance of community engagement, using Arnstein's ladder of citizen participation to illustrate how involving youth in higher levels of partnership and control can lead to empowerment and more impactful research outcomes. Dr. Bauermeister described an ongoing project called STARS, a suicide prevention intervention for SGM youth aged 18 to 24 in Philadelphia. This NIMH-funded implementation science trial aimed to reduce suicide by assigning participants to a safety plan intervention, supplemented by a web app and peer mentor support system. SGM youth peer mentors provided six weeks of mentorship, helping participants integrate safety plans into their lives, address negative self-talk, and build support systems. The study monitored fidelity and effectiveness through assessments and in-depth interviews, showing promising early results in encouraging participants to use their safety plans more frequently. The talk underscored the necessity of leveraging young people's expertise in clinical trials, advocating for fair compensation and structured training for peer mentors. Dr. Bauermeister emphasized the importance of funding and structural support to enable youth to contribute as agents of change in scientific research. He called for a shift in how grants were structured to facilitate youth engagement and highlighted the need for scalable interventions that could benefit from the unique insights of SGM youth. Discussion Dr. Terrinieka Powell reflected on the panel presentations, noting that: Community-engaged approaches were crucial for expanding our thinking and practices, allowing the field to address mental health challenges among minoritized and marginalized young people more effectively by incorporating a diverse range of theories and perspectives. - The presentations highlighted the significant mental health challenges faced by LGBTQ+, minoritized, and marginalized young people, emphasizing the urgency of addressing these issues through innovative research and intervention strategies. - There was a clear need for integrative theories and perspectives, including intersectionality, feminist, womanist, and critical race theories, to enhance the understanding and practices in addressing mental health challenges among these populations. - Community-engaged research offered diverse intervention options involving young people and community partners at all stages of research. It demonstrated that there was no single correct way to approach these challenges; instead, multiple effective methods existed. - Young people played a vital role in giving and receiving support, particularly through peer mentoring, which had proven to be highly effective when they were properly trained and enthusiastic about their involvement. - It was essential to continuously expand the conversation by including more voices, particularly those from historically marginalized groups, to enrich research findings and make them more relatable and easily disseminated. - Sharing best practices in accessible formats, such as webinars, was crucial, given the difficulty of staying current with scholarly articles. Platforms like those provided by NIMH were invaluable for learning and sharing effective strategies. - Reducing the time from research testing to widespread dissemination was critical, as young people cannot afford to wait for prolonged periods. Strategies to expedite the dissemination of effective interventions were therefore necessary. - As the field moved forward, there was a need to invite diverse participants into the conversation, consistently questioning who was missing, and remain committed to learning, adapting, and sharing effective strategies and practices to address the mental health needs of minoritized and marginalized youth. - Dr. Powell welcomed panelists to a Question and Answer session. Question: What are some of the strategies used to recruit and retain partners, especially young people, on teams and keep them engaged? Answers: Dr. Bauermeister emphasized the importance of structured pathways to employment and the value of building credible resumes through community-engaged research, which helped young people understand the significance of their contributions to science. Dr. Angelino discussed using multimodal approaches, such as incorporating storytelling and artistic expressions, to engage Indigenous youth in research, emphasizing the importance of culturally relevant methods to foster engagement and mentorship. Dr. Reisner highlighted the need to create jobs and offer insurance for community advisory board members, sharing an example of adjusting research methods based on youth feedback to ensure separate, dedicated spaces for youth and providers. Dr. Singh stressed the importance of long-term relationship building, cultural humility, and providing reparative acts such as financial resources and mentorship to foster authentic engagement with queer and trans youth. Dr. Salerno advocated for integrating social justice and advocacy into research to keep youth engaged, emphasizing co-collaboration and giving youth a sense of ownership over the projects to increase their investment and retention. Question: The folks we start with are not always the folks we end up with. When we work with young people, who are harder to reach after they graduate high school. How is everybody handling these transitions and maintaining continuity of the research project and the partnerships? Answers: Dr. Singh emphasized the emotional challenges of maintaining long-term relationships in research, highlighting the importance of using community agreements to clarify transitions and encourage ongoing connections through social media and direct messaging. Dr. Singh also noted that these tools helped sustain engagement despite personal or legislative challenges. Dr. Reisner described the flexibility of their engagement strategies, acknowledging the dynamic nature of young people's lives. He shared an example from the "Light" project, which adapted its focus based on community feedback to address mortality rates, illustrating the need to honor participants' changing levels of engagement and life circumstances. Dr. Bauermeister warned against a colonial mindset in research, advocating for respecting young people's evolving interests and careers. He recommended structured graduation principles, like those used by the Adolescent Trials Network, to facilitate smooth transitions and affirm participants' growth and changing goals. Dr. Salerno reflected on the inevitability of transitions in research, stressing the value of positive impacts during active project phases. He emphasized the importance of accepting the natural end of certain projects while celebrating the achievements and moving forward with new initiatives. Question: There has been a checkered, sometimes catastrophic, history that has given marginalized, minoritized communities reason to mistrust and distrust researchers. Do you have any thoughts on how you can overcome that legitimate mistrust and distrust to truly, authentically engage the community? Answers: Dr. Singh emphasized the importance of owning past mistakes and practicing deep, meaningful listening, highlighting that acknowledging the truth and sincerely listening to the community could help build trust. Dr. Salerno discussed the problem of "helicopter researching" and stressed the need for researchers to remain engaged with communities and ensure mutual benefits, thereby avoiding the perception of using communities for research and then abandoning them. Dr. Reisner highlighted the varying strategies needed depending on the environment and emphasized addressing specific barriers, such as administrative challenges in compensation that could foster mistrust if not managed transparently. Dr. Powell echoed the importance of acknowledging historical harm and actively working to build a different relationship by being transparent and diligent in addressing practical issues such as payment delays that could negatively impact community trust. Risk & Resilience: Individual, Interpersonal, and Family-Level Factors Discussant: Erika E. Forbes, Ph.D., (she/her), University of Pittsburgh Moderator: Laura A. Thomas Ph.D., (she/her), Division of Translational Research, NIMH Psychosocial Functioning in Transgender Youth After Two Years of Hormone Treatment Diane Chen, Ph.D., (she/her), Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine Dr. Diane Chen presented findings from the Trans Youth Care United States study, which focused on psychosocial functioning in transgender youth after two years of hormone treatment. This NIH-funded longitudinal observational study evaluated the physical and psychosocial outcomes of transgender youth starting puberty suppression or gender-affirming hormones. Dr. Chen's research aimed to address gaps in the existing literature by enrolling a larger, more diverse sample of 315 youth, primarily white and designated female at birth, and following them over a longer period. The study focused on changes in appearance congruence, depression, anxiety, positive affect, and life satisfaction. The study found significant improvements in psychosocial outcomes over a two-year period. Youth reported increased appearance congruence and life satisfaction, alongside decreased depression and anxiety symptoms. These improvements were particularly pronounced in youth who had received early gender-affirming care, including those who had previously received pubertal suppression treatment or had started hormones early. The data indicated that these youth experienced higher baseline appearance congruence and better mental health outcomes. Dr. Chen highlighted the importance of early intervention and continuous support for enhancing psychosocial functioning in transgender youth. In another study, Dr. Chen also explored the relationship between appearance congruence and mental health outcomes. This study revealed that increases in appearance congruence were significantly associated with concurrent decreases in depression and anxiety and increases in positive affect and life satisfaction. These findings suggested that appearance congruence may be a key mechanism driving the positive effects of hormone treatment on psychosocial functioning. Dr. Chen emphasized the need for further research to extend these findings and explore hormone treatment's long-term impacts beyond two years, particularly among more diverse and representative samples. The study's continuation aimed to provide deeper insights into the medical care needs of non-binary youth and those who may discontinue treatment. Parental Support is Not Enough: Advancing LGBTQ+ Youth Family Research and Practice Jessica Fish, Ph.D., (she/her), School of Public Health, University of Maryland Dr. Jessica Fish highlighted the critical need for more comprehensive research into the family dynamics affecting LGBTQ+ youth. Dr. Fish emphasized that while the acceptance of LGBTQ+ youth by their families had generally improved, family interactions remained complex and multifaceted. Research indicated that both accepting and rejecting behaviors from parents can coexist, creating a nuanced environment for LGBTQ+ youth. This complexity challenged the traditional binary view of family acceptance versus rejection, urging a more sophisticated approach to understanding and supporting LGBTQ+ youth in their family contexts. The LGBTQ Youth and Family Study (LYFS) explored how cisgender, heterosexual parents interacted with their LGBTQ+ adolescents. The study included 27 families from the mid-Atlantic region, involving separate interviews with both parents and youth. Initial findings identified seven categories of parental behaviors, both supportive and non-supportive, impacting their child's sexual minority identity development. These behaviors included actions that facilitated exploration and actions that inadvertently encouraged concealment. The research underscored the ongoing and iterative nature of parent-child interactions and the mixed messages youth often receive, which can simultaneously support and undermine their development. Dr. Fish advocated radical revision of how LGBTQ+ family environments were conceptualized in research. She called for moving beyond the simple dichotomy of family acceptance versus rejection to a broader understanding of family processes and environments. This shift would allow for more effective measures, methods, and interventions that address the unique challenges faced by LGBTQ+ youth. Dr. Fish highlighted the importance of parents actively engaging in socialization practices to help their children navigate a world filled with stigma and discrimination, drawing parallels to racial and ethnic socialization strategies. She emphasized the need to better equip families to foster resilience and positive development in LGBTQ+ youth despite the ongoing societal challenges they faced. Oppression-Based Stress, Mental Health, and Substance Use among QTBIPC Adolescents Ethan Mereish, Ph.D., (he/him), University of Maryland, College Park Dr. Ethan Mereish talked about the significant health disparities faced by Queer, Trans, Black, Indigenous, People of Color (QTBIPC) adolescents. Dr. Mereish emphasized that QTBIPC adolescents reported poorer mental health and higher substance use compared to their same-race, heterosexual, and cisgender peers, as well as their white SGM counterparts. He connected these health disparities to various forms of oppression, including racism, heterosexism, and cissexism, which intersect and compound to exacerbate stress and adverse health outcomes for these adolescents. Dr. Mereish gathered data from over 3,000 QTBIPC adolescents aged 13 to 17 from the 2017 LGBTQ National Teen Survey. This cross-sectional study found that nearly all participants experienced at least one intersectional stressor, such as microaggressions, which were linked to higher levels of depressive symptoms, lower self-esteem, and a diminished sense of mastery. Dr. Mereish also explored the impact of these stressors on substance use, finding that intersectional microaggressions were correlated with increased use of alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine. However, supportive factors did not sufficiently buffer the adverse effects of these stressors on substance use. Dr. Mereish concluded with insights from a more recent study using the 2021 National Teen Survey, which corroborated previous findings and highlighted that drinking to cope mediated the relationship between microaggressions and hazardous alcohol use. He stressed the need for longitudinal research to understand how these stressors and health outcomes evolved and called for interventions targeting structural oppression. Additionally, Dr. Mereish emphasized the importance of empowering QTBIPC adolescents in advocacy and social change, noting their strong motivation for social justice despite the significant barriers they face. Traversing the Liminality of Young Adulthood Rachel Schmitz, Ph.D., (she/her/ella), Oklahoma State University Dr. Rachel Schmitz focused on the challenges faced by LGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness and residential instability. Her research emphasized the intersectionality of identity, family dynamics, religion, and resilience in these young individuals' lives. Dr. Schmitz shared qualitative findings from in-depth interviews with LGBTQ+ youth, highlighting their struggles with economic precarity and the impact of being ostracized by their families. Understanding these young people's perspectives was crucial for developing effective support systems and policies that address their unique needs. Dr. Schmitz's research underscored the importance of person-centered language and approaches in working with homeless youth. She advocated for a shift from viewing them primarily as homeless youth to recognizing them as young people experiencing homelessness. This change in perspective helped them acknowledge their identities beyond their housing status. The research also highlighted the high representation of queer youth among the homeless population and the compounded difficulties they faced due to their marginalized sexual and gender identities. Structural and interpersonal oppressions further exacerbated their challenges, making it essential to listen to their lived experiences to improve services and policies. Dr. Schmitz's studies, which were conducted in Nebraska and Oklahoma, revealed that identity development, family relationships, and the role of companion animals were critical areas influencing the well-being of LGBTQ+ youth. She explored the connection between youth and their pets in Oklahoma, finding that pets often provide emotional support and stability. Her findings called for more inclusive mental health and housing services that considered the unique needs of LGBTQ+ youth, including those related to their companion animals. Dr. Schmitz concluded by recommending that policymakers and service providers adopt more LGBTQ+ inclusive practices and involve young people in the design and implementation of support systems. Eating Disorders in Sexual and Gender Minority Adolescents Jason Nagata, M.D., M.Sc., (he/him), School of Medicine, University of California San Francisco Dr. Jason Nagata discussed the intricate connections among gender identity, body image, and eating disorders in SGM adolescents. He reviewed a case study of a 16-year-old transgender boy experiencing distress due to his feminine body features and menstrual periods. His struggle with bullying and body dissatisfaction led him to engage in excessive weightlifting and severe calorie restriction, illustrating the complex interplay between muscle dysmorphia and eating disorders in transgender youth. Dr. Nagata emphasized that eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, had severe physical and psychological consequences, characterized by behaviors such as fasting, meal skipping, and excessive exercise. Dr. Nagata highlighted the higher prevalence of eating disorders among SGM adolescents compared to their heterosexual peers, citing data from the Pride Study. This study revealed that sexual minority adolescents had two to four times greater odds of an eating disorder diagnosis, while over 40 percent of transgender adolescents reported disordered eating behaviors. He discussed various theoretical models that could explain these high rates, including the tripartite influence model and minority stress theory. These models suggested that societal stigma, discrimination, and internalized homophobia or transphobia significantly contributed to poor body image and eating disorder vulnerability, particularly during adolescence. Dr. Nagata also presented findings from the ABCD Study that linked higher screen time and problematic social media use to increased eating disorder symptoms among SGM adolescents. The study found that SGM adolescents reported significantly more screen time and problematic social media use, which was associated with higher odds of binge eating disorder and other eating disorder symptoms. Dr. Nagata emphasized the importance of positive identity feelings, family and social support, safe school environments, and access to gender-affirming care as protective factors against eating disorders. He advocated for interventions that maximized the benefits of social media while minimizing its risks and called for further research to better understand and support this vulnerable population. LGBTQ Youth Mental Health Risk and Protective Factors Myeshia Price, Ph.D., (she/they), School of Education, Kinsey Institute, Indiana University Dr. Myeshia Price highlighted the increased risk of suicidality among LGBTQ+ youth with data from her tenure at The Trevor Project. Dr. Price emphasized that LGBTQ+ youth were more than four times as likely to attempt suicide than their peers, a statistic supported by CDC data. This risk was compounded when multiple marginalized identities, such as race and gender identity, intersected—introducing additional stressors such as racism and gender-based discrimination. Dr. Price presented data from the 2023 Trevor Project study, which surveyed 28,000 LGBTQ+ youth aged 13-24, revealing that 14 percent had attempted suicide in the past year, with rates higher among transgender and non-binary youth. Dr. Price also discussed protective factors that can mitigate these risks. They stressed the importance of supportive and affirming environments, noting that better treatment and affirmation could lead to more positive mental health outcomes. For instance, simple acts such as respecting young people's pronouns and creating affirming spaces at home, school, and in the community could significantly reduce the risk of mental health issues. Research showed that young LGBTQ+ individuals who experienced support and acceptance reported lower rates of anxiety and depression. This underscored the critical need for inclusive and supportive policies and practices in various societal institutions. Dr. Price concluded with a call to action for systemic changes to support LGBTQ+ youth. They advocated for incorporating community assets and peer support in mental health interventions. Dr. Price highlighted the Trevor Project's focus on safe identification and coordinated mental health referrals as effective strategies to improve outcomes. They emphasized that while LGBTQ+ youth demonstrated resilience, there was a pressing need for research and policies that recognized and addressed the unique challenges faced by this population to foster an environment where they can thrive. Discussion Dr. Erika E. Forbes reflected on the panel presentations, noting that: There was a need to explore neural mechanisms and mental health disparities, particularly focusing on mental health disparities among SGM youth. - Sexual minority youth with a lower response in the temporal junction area of the brain were more prone to higher suicidal ideation, depression, and victimization. These tendencies might contribute to increased mental health risks due to factors such as disengagement from social feedback, which could stem from past victimization experiences. - There was a higher left caudate response to social support interactions coupled with negative responses to real-life social threats that correlated with higher suicidal ideation. - Sensitivity to social information and threats could have both protective and risk implications for mental health, emphasizing the need to understand these mechanisms at both individual and group levels. - It was important to consider intersectional oppression, diverse sexual orientations, and gender identities in research to capture the full extent of experiences and risks. - Socioeconomic contexts were also critical in understanding mental health disparities and outcomes. - The effects of social media use depended on context and individual circumstances. - Developmental timing was a critical factor in interventions and understanding risks and resilience in SGM youth. - There was a need to build interventions based on findings about processes and mechanisms and translate these into practical policies and interventions. - Dr. Forbes welcomed panelists to a Question and Answer session. Question: How can we understand and integrate varying risk and protective factors into our hypotheses, research formulations, findings interpretations, and policy or intervention translations, considering intersectionality, sexual orientation, gender identity, and socioeconomic contexts? Answers: Dr. Chen highlighted the significant variability in mental health outcomes among youth receiving gender-affirming hormone treatments, emphasizing the need to consider individual risk profiles and contextual factors such as minority stress and family support to address the holistic mental health needs of trans youth. Dr. Forbes mentioned the importance of considering multi-level vulnerability factors, including stress and structural issues, for SGM youth, suggesting a broader ecologically valid perspective in research. Dr. Schmitz agreed with the holistic approach and discussed the role of companion animals as sources of support for marginalized groups, emphasizing the need to address not just basic needs but also personalized supports for mental health and resilience, as well as varying economic stability. Question: What are the next steps for interventions or guidance? Answer: Dr. Nagata emphasized the need for updated, non-binary growth charts and clinical guidelines for gender minority adolescents, highlighting the lack of data on normal growth rates and health metrics for non-binary individuals. He advocated for more comprehensive guidance and data to support transgender youth across general and specialty pediatrics. Question: What about in our conceptual models? Does anyone have ideas about how to incorporate many different factors, such as intersectional identities and other risk and contextual factors? Answers: Dr. Fish highlighted the importance of considering family dynamics and parenting practices in understanding youth interactions and their impact on sexual orientation and gender identity development. She emphasized the need for research on specific family processes, especially in racially and ethnically minoritized communities, to leverage resilience and support for LGBTQ+ youth. Dr. Price focused on the protective role of cultural socialization in Black families and how these existing tools can be adapted to support LGBTQ+ youth. They also underscored the significance of addressing socioeconomic factors, as they play a critical role in resilience and the ability to meet basic needs, which in turn impacted mental health outcomes. Question: How do you tailor your research or research questions to the age and developmental stage of the participants that that you're focusing on, or how are you taking that into account? Answers: Dr. Nagata highlighted the importance of considering age, developmental stage, pubertal status, and level of parental support in adolescent research. He emphasized the wide developmental range from ages 10 to 24 and noted how family-based therapy was more common for minors. In contrast, cognitive behavioral therapy was preferred for more independent young adults. He stressed the necessity of adapting treatment modalities based on the individual's age and developmental independence. Dr. Mereish emphasized the inclusion of a teen advisory board in his research, ensuring that measures, surveys, and materials were appropriate for the 13- to 17-year-old age group. He found that teenagers could provide valuable feedback on language and content, making the research more relevant and effective for their age group. Dr. Schmitz incorporated feedback mechanisms into her qualitative interview-based studies, asking participants how they found the interview and what they would like the study to achieve. This approach allowed for real-time adjustments to research methods and ensured that findings were applied to benefit the youth involved. Research on Services, Intervention, and Prevention Discussant: Dorothy Espelage, Ph.D., (she/her), School of Education, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Moderators: Mary Acri, Ph.D., (she/her), Division of Services and Intervention Research, NIMH LGBTQ-Affirmative Mental Health Care: From Theory to Trials to Implementation John Pachankis, Ph.D., (he/him), School of Public Health, Yale University Dr. John Pachankis presented an overview of evidence-based mental health treatments specifically designed for SGM individuals. He highlighted the need for such treatments due to the unique challenges faced by LGBTQ+ populations, including the prevalence of harmful alternatives such as conversion therapies. He justified the development of LGBTQ-affirmative treatments as essential to countering minority stress, which was often not adequately addressed by general evidence-based therapies. Dr. Pachankis emphasized that tailored treatments could provide scientific insights into the impact of minority stress on mental health and serve as a professional guideline, as called for by the American Psychological Association. Dr. Pachankis detailed the development process of a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) manual specifically adapted for LGBTQ+ individuals. This process involved extensive consultations with mental health professionals and LGBTQ+ individuals experiencing mental health issues. The adapted CBT addressed minority stress by helping individuals acknowledge and challenge stigma, internalized negative beliefs, and social withdrawal tendencies. Initial randomized controlled trials with young gay and bisexual men, as well as young sexual minority women, demonstrated significant improvements in depression, anxiety, and substance use—validating the efficacy of the treatment. These studies highlighted the treatment's ability to address multiple co-occurring outcomes, such as reducing comorbidity in depression, anxiety, and hazardous behaviors. Dr. Pachankis talked about the implementation of LGBTQ-affirmative CBT in community settings. His team surveyed LGBTQ community centers' capacity to adopt this treatment, collaborating with Centerlink, which coordinates these centers across the U.S. The positive responses led to training programs for over 700 mental health providers across 90 centers. These programs significantly improved providers' cultural competence and knowledge of minority stress and CBT skills. Dr. Pachankis advocated for the integration of implementation science to ensure widespread adoption of evidence-based LGBTQ+-affirmative treatments, stressing the importance of rapid dissemination and adaptation to various community contexts to meet the mental health needs of LGBTQ+ populations. Targeting multilevel transphobia through a multilevel intervention Maggi A. Price, Ph.D., (she/her), School of Social Work, Boston College Dr. Maggi A. Price presented her research on targeting multilevel transphobia through a multilevel intervention, emphasizing the importance of addressing stigma at various levels. She began by defining stigma and its different forms: internalized, interpersonal, and structural. Internalized stigma involved adopting negative societal beliefs about oneself, interpersonal stigma included discrimination and identity-based bullying, and structural stigma comprised societal attitudes and policies that hinder the well-being of marginalized groups. Dr. Price highlighted that both interpersonal and internalized stigma were strongly linked to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety among LGBTQ+ youth, while preliminary research on structural stigma showed similar detrimental effects. Dr. Price detailed a study focused on improving mental health care for transgender youth through a multilevel intervention. This intervention was designed to address internalized stigma at the client level through therapy, interpersonal stigma at the provider level through training, and structural stigma at the clinic level through policy and practice changes. The research team collaborated closely with transgender and non-binary youth, their parents, and experienced providers to develop the intervention components. These components included gender-affirming psychotherapy training for therapists, which was interactive and self-paced, and modifications to clinic policies and environments to be more inclusive and affirming for transgender clients. Preliminary results from this study indicated significant improvements in therapists' attitudes, knowledge, and confidence, as well as behavioral changes in providing more affirming care. The pilot clinic began offering gender-affirming groups for youth and their parents, demonstrating the intervention's positive impact. These studies underscored the necessity of community engagement and evidence-based strategies in developing effective interventions to combat multilevel transphobia and improve mental health outcomes for transgender youth. “You Kind of Forget About It”: Latinx and Non-Latin White Sexual Minority Youth Drinkers’ Experiences with Discrimination, Affect, and Drinking Robert Rosales, Ph.D., L.C.S.W., (he/him/él), Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies, School of Public Health, Brown University Dr. Robert Rosales emphasized the prevalence of underage drinking and its reciprocal effect on mental health, highlighting that sexual minority youth were at higher risk for alcohol use. His study aimed to explore the experiences of Latinx and non-Latin white sexual minority youth with alcohol, focusing on how discrimination affected their drinking behaviors. Dr. Rosales recruited and conducted interviews via Zoom to gather with twenty 15- to 19-year-old participants who had consumed alcohol in the past thirty days and faced discrimination. The study revealed distinct differences in drinking behaviors between Latinx and non-Latin white participants. Latinx youth often cited cultural and social reasons for drinking, such as social norms in their communities, while non-Latin white youth mentioned drinking for enjoyment and socialization. Additionally, Latinx participants frequently expressed concerns about legal repercussions, such as losing their student visas, which influenced their decisions to abstain from drinking. The study also highlighted that sexual minority youth used alcohol to cope with stress and negative emotions stemming from racism and heterosexism, although this sometimes exacerbated their mental health issues. Dr. Rosales recommended that treatment programs for sexual minority youth address the specific stressors of racism and heterosexism. He noted the potential for culturally adapted interventions, which have shown success in reducing alcohol use and improving mental health among Latinx adults. He emphasized the need for these interventions to be tailored to the developmental stages of youth, considering their unique cultural contexts and stressors. Despite the study's limitations, including its small sample size and age range, the outcomes highlighted the importance of understanding and addressing the complex factors influencing alcohol use among Latinx and non-Latin white sexual minority youth. Prevention and Treatment of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) for Sexual and Gender Minority Youth (SGMY) Katie Edwards, Ph.D., (she/her), University of Nebraska-Lincoln Dr. Katie M. Edwards talked about her research on the prevention and treatment of intimate partner violence (IPV) among sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY), indicating that these groups experienced higher rates of IPV compared to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts. Her research, which included a diverse sample of over 300 SGMY, found significant rates of both perpetration and victimization of teen dating violence within a three-month period. The study highlighted the exceptionally high vulnerability of queer youth of color and trans and gender-diverse youth, emphasizing the necessity of understanding these dynamics through an intersectional lens. Additionally, the findings indicated that SGMY survivors of IPV often face worse outcomes due to compounded minority stressors. Dr. Edwards emphasized the importance of primary prevention of IPV, using a social-ecological model to address universal risk and protective factors and those specific to SGMY. Her work identified internalized homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, and identity concealment as significant risk factors, whereas a strong sense of the LGBTQ+ community was found to be a protective factor. She noted that existing universal prevention programs lacked effectiveness for SGMY, due to their heteronormative frameworks and lack of relevance to the lived experiences of SGMY. Her team's efforts include adapting these programs to incorporate theories of minority stress and resiliency, making them more applicable and impactful for SGMY. Dr. Edwards reviewed PRISM (Promoting Resilient Youth with Strong Hearts and Minds), which was an online intervention program designed to reduce IPV and alcohol use among SGMY. This program, co-developed with a queer youth advisory board, featured nine 45-minute sessions facilitated by SGM adults. Preliminary results from their randomized controlled trial involving 304 youth showed that participants in the PRISM condition experienced reduced alcohol use and teen dating violence, as well as increased LGBTQ+ community sense and improved sexual communication self-efficacy. These outcomes were sustained at a three-month follow-up, demonstrating the program's effectiveness and acceptability among the youth. Dr. Edwards highlighted the need for trauma-informed, affirming responses to disclosures of IPV and the importance of dismantling systemic oppressions that exacerbate these issues. Single-Session Interventions to Promote Mental Health in SGM Youth Jessica Schleider, Ph.D., (she/her), Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University Dr. Jessica Schleider highlighted the critical need for single-session interventions (SSIs) to address the mental health disparities faced by SGM youth. She emphasized that traditional, multi-session mental health interventions were often inaccessible to SGM youth due to systemic barriers and provider shortages. Dr. Schleider proposed that SSIs were a scalable, immediate solution to provide effective mental health support. These interventions, intentionally designed for single encounters, had shown significant benefits in various studies, demonstrating efficacy comparable to multi-session therapies in many cases. Her meta-review revealed that SSIs significantly improved mental health outcomes across multiple issues with an overall effect size of approximately 0.25. Dr. Schleider discussed the design and implementation of SSIs tailored specifically for SGM youth. Her lab's interventions, developed in collaboration with youth, were accessible online and did not require parental consent, making them particularly suitable for this population. One notable program, Project Rise, was a digital, self-guided intervention focusing on minority stress theory and coping strategies. A pilot randomized controlled trial with 538 adolescents recruited via Instagram showed that Project Rise effectively decreased internalized stigma and increased identity pride and self-acceptance. The intervention achieved a high completion rate of 90 percent, indicating its acceptability and feasibility for SGM youth. These findings underscored the importance of SSIs in bridging gaps in mental health care for SGM youth. The SSIs had reached more than 30,000 SGM youths, highlighting the potential for broad impact. She advocated for integrating SSIs within and outside formal healthcare settings to ensure sustainable access. Additionally, she stressed the need for policy changes to address structural barriers, such as parental consent requirements, which hindered SGM youth from accessing necessary mental health care. Her ongoing collaborations aim to develop tools and dashboards to streamline advocacy for these policy changes, ensuring that all youth can self-refer to mental health care regardless of their familial environment. Using the Dynamic Adaptation Process to Advance LGBTQ+ Health Equity in High Schools Cathleen E. Willging, Ph.D., (she/her), Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation Dr. Cathleen E. Willging reviewed a study that aimed to address health disparities among LGBTQ+ youth in high schools using the Dynamic Adaptation Process (DAP). The study was conducted across 42 high schools in New Mexico, a rural state with a significant population of Latinx and Indigenous people. The research focused on implementing six evidence-informed practices to enhance the well-being of LGBTQ+ students. These practices included establishing safe spaces such as Gay-Straight Alliances (GSAs); prohibiting harassment and bullying; and providing inclusive health education, staff development, and access to experienced medical and behavioral health providers. The study employed a randomized design with schools either using the DAP immediately or after a delay. This process involved multiple implementation strategies such as assessment, mobilizing champions, coaching, and monitoring to support schools in adopting these practices. The DAP was guided by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework, and relied on data from semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and collaborative assessments. These assessments helped in action planning and were crucial in understanding the contextual factors affecting implementation, such as political climates, knowledge gaps, and pragmatic concerns (e.g., time and turnover). The study emphasized the importance of community-academic partnerships involving school officials, professionals, and local LGBTQ+ organizations. These partnerships facilitated training and technical assistance, and they were pivotal in setting up GSAs, establishing supportive policies, and responding to crises. The iterative nature of the DAP allowed schools to adopt practices thoughtfully and responsively, enhancing the overall implementation. The results showed significant improvements in the adoption of the six practices. Initially, schools had implemented about 43 percent of the practice elements, which increased to approximately 80 percent by the end of the study period, with these changes being statistically significant. This success was attributed to the structured collaborative assessments, which helped schools create effective action plans, and the supportive role of implementation resource teams. These teams, comprising various school personnel and sometimes students and parents, were essential in building capacity and confidence in action planning and facilitating collaboration. The study demonstrated that the DAP not only advanced LGBTQ+ health equity but also had the potential to support other innovations addressing health disparities in school settings. Discussion Dr. Dorothy Espelage reflected on the panel presentations, noting that: Despite structural stigma, there was hope due to ongoing efforts to support SGM youth, particularly in underserved contexts. - NIH funding has enabled rigorous program and intervention development, focusing on implementation science beyond just randomized controlled trials. - The adaptation of CBT treatment manuals to address minority stress was particularly helpful for SGM youth. - The extension of multi-level stigma frameworks from clinical settings to schools was critical, as teachers' attitudes significantly impacted SGM youth. - Research on Latinx sexual minority youth highlighted the complexity of substance use behaviors and underscored the need NIH and CDC to continuously track trends. - Single-session interventions were effective and challenged the belief that longer sessions were always better. It was important to disseminate this work through popular media channels. - Waivers of parent and guardian consent for research with youth were vital, especially given the pushback from Institutional Review Boards. - Structural stigma was increasing, and policies played a critical role in shaping the experiences of SGM youth. However, social media could serve as a protective factor. - Implementation science in schools was challenging but essential, and required iterative processes and commitment, as shown in successful school-based interventions. - Strong theoretical frameworks, such as theories of change and logic models, were essential for systematic research and understanding proximal to distal impacts. - Policies at state and district levels significantly impacted the well-being of SGM youth, highlighting the importance of queer-friendly environments. - It was important to continue focusing on reducing structural stigma and fostering supportive policies to improve the mental health and safety of SGM youth. - Dr. Acri welcomed panelists to a Question and Answer session. Question: Have you experienced any barriers related to coverage of services by private or public health insurance in your work developing gender affirming interventions or prevention programs? Answers: Dr. Schleider highlighted that there were no insurance infrastructures to reimburse for SSIs, disproportionately affecting SGM youth who often had limited access to care. Her team was working with state mental health agencies to secure Medicaid waivers and conduct pilot studies to demonstrate cost-effectiveness, emphasizing the need for innovative access pathways. Dr. Price added that her training intervention included modules to help transgender youth access services, providing resources like letter templates and referral processes for gender-affirming services. These measures aimed to overcome barriers to care in regions where such services were available. Dr. Pachankis emphasized the significant role of LGBTQ+ community centers in offering services to under- or uninsured individuals. He suggested that these centers’ methods of providing support groups and peer counseling should be studied and credited, as they filled critical gaps in mental health care left by larger systems. Question: How do we sustain, adopt, sustain and scale up mental health interventions for these populations in a contentious political climate? Answers: Dr. Willging emphasized the importance of developing an implementation support infrastructure at district and state levels to sustain mental health interventions, noting that school personnel turnover was a significant challenge. Dr. Schleider recommended increasing access to mental health support for all youth, advocating for broad programs that allowed for individualized support based on specific needs and highlighting the necessity of policy changes at the state level to ensure consistency and reduce legal liabilities. Dr. Edwards discussed the use of waivers of guardian consent in studies to protect youth who were not out to their families, stressing the importance of creating safe online spaces for these youth to access support and affirming care. Reflections on Meeting Highlights, Common Themes, Future Directions Christina P.C. Borba, Ph.D., M.P.H., (she/her), Director, Office for Disparities Research and Workforce Diversity, NIMH Dr. Christina Borba reflected on the two-day conference, expressing enthusiasm and gratitude and highlighting several critical themes and future directions for the NIMH. One major focus was the measurement of gender identity and sexual orientation, noting the progression towards more accurate and inclusive data collection methods. Despite these advancements, there was a need for continued work to improve the quality of data and reduce confusion in responses. This aligned with NIMH’s commitment to refining measurement tools and expanding understanding. Another significant theme was the importance of adopting an intersectionality lens in research and practice, recognizing how intersecting identities impact mental health outcomes. Dr. Borba stressed that stigma remained a prevalent issue at multiple levels—from interpersonal to structural—with a particular gap in research on structural stigma. The conference also highlighted the strengths of LGBTQ+ youth, suggesting that future interventions should leverage these strengths and involve youth as peer mentors, thereby fostering community engagement and empowerment. The role of social media in mental health was also discussed, acknowledging its potential for delivering evidence-based interventions and providing a positive impact on queer youth. This perspective encouraged NIMH to consider the dual nature of social media in both supporting and challenging mental health. Additionally, the importance of community and creating safe spaces for youth was underscored, advocating for solidarity within and between communities to support LGBTQ+ youth. Finally, Dr. Borba highlighted the critical role of implementation science in ensuring the scalability and sustainability of evidence-based treatments. She outlined future directions for NIMH, emphasizing the need for research on structural factors affecting mental health, development of structural interventions, and true community-engaged research. Dr. Borba also called for improved dissemination practices to ensure research findings reach and benefit the communities involved. She emphasized NIMH’s commitment to advancing the mental health and well-being of LGBTQ+ youth through continued research and inclusive practices.

> As Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Sexual & Gender Minority (SGM) Research Office, I’m surprised by how rarely I am asked about my sexual orientation or gender identity. Aside from some assumptions that have been shared with me, it doesn’t come up, and I recently began to wonder why. The truth is, regardless of my personal identity, I can be a strong ally to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) community. And so can you. For me, being an ally means recognizing a struggle that is not mine. It means listening. It means speaking up. And it means not making it (whatever it is) about me. Being an ally can be scary, complicated, and uncomfortable. It can also be one of the most important things that you do, in both your personal and professional lives. Being an ally is more than a personal identity about personal choices, it is also about striving to be an institutional leader that helps to develop LGBTQ-inclusive policies and practices. It is communicating about why having a diverse workplace can make us more effective employees, more empathetic colleagues, and more aware and engaged community members. Developing allyship for the LGBTQ community across the NIH is one of the most critical activities that I do to help make the NIH a more inclusive environment for all employees, patients, and visitors. It is imperative for me to communicate to colleagues about the need to expand research on LGBTQ populations, to encourage more data collection on sexual orientation and gender identity, and to help deepen our understanding of the health disparities that so many in the LGBTQ community face. August marks my seventeenth year as a public servant at the NIH. Throughout this time, I have been grateful to work at such a stellar institution alongside such dedicated colleagues. In my current position, I have the privilege of seeing up close the results of allyship and how setting a tone of inclusiveness can make measurable differences for the health of research participants and colleagues. Employees at the Clinical Center have embraced the challenge of collecting data on the gender identity of all Clinical Center patients. This data is of course scientifically relevant, but it is also central to recognizing individuals for who they are and for signaling to people that they matter, that they are seen. Program officers across the agency are encouraging principal investigators to follow their research interests and pursue scientific careers in SGM health research. They are developing funding opportunities and teaching students and trainees about grantspersonship. NIH leadership is continuing to demonstrate the ideals of allyship by supporting programs that foster LGBTQ inclusive research and policies that recognize LGBTQ trainees and employees. Over and over again, I have met people at NIH who, once aware of the unique issues faced by LGBTQ populations, have taken to allyship with purpose, passion, and clarity. Building allyship across the NIH starts by making a commitment to try. I am not a perfect ally. I have reaped the benefits of my cisgender, heterosexual identity. I make mistakes. I have used incorrect pronouns. I have made assumptions about people. I apologize. I learn. I try again. And in the end, I am a better person. Won’t you join me? Do you have a story idea for us?

LGBTIQ Terminology [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://edi.nih.gov/our-communities/sexual-and-gender-minority/resources/lgbtiq-terminology)

> Terms and Definitions AFAB: (pronounced ā-fab) Acronym meaning Assigned Female at Birth. AFAB people may or may not identify as female some or all of the time. AFAB is a useful term for educating about issues that may happen to these bodies without connecting to womanhood or femaleness. Affirmed Gender: An individual’s true gender, as opposed to their gender assigned at birth. This term should replace terms like new gender or chosen gender, which imply that an individual chooses their gender. Agender: (pronounced ā-ˈjen-dər) Refers to a person who does not identify with or experience any gender. Agender is different from nonbinary (see Nonbinary) because many nonbinary people do experience gender. Ally: A term relating generally to individuals who support marginalized groups. In the LGBTQ+ community, this term is used to describe someone who is supportive of LGBTQ+ individuals and the community, either personally or as an advocate. Allies include both heterosexual and cisgender people who advocate for equality in partnership with LGBTQ+ people, as well as people within the LGBTQ+ community who advocate for others in the community. “Ally” is not an identity, and allyship is an ongoing process of learning that includes action. AMAB: (pronounced ā-mab) Acronym meaning Assigned Male at Birth. AMAB people may or may not identify as male some or all of the time . AMAB is a useful term for educating about issues that may happen to these bodies without connecting to manhood or maleness. Androgynous: Having physical elements of both femininity and masculinity, whether expressed through sex, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation. Androgyne (pronounced an-druh-jain ) is another term for an androgynous individual. Aromantic: Sometimes abbreviated as aro (pronounced ā-row), the term refers to an individual who does not experience romantic attraction. Aromantic people exist on a spectrum of romantic attraction and can use terms such as gray aromantic or grayromantic to describe their place within that spectrum. Aromantic people can experience sexual attraction. Asexual: Sometimes abbreviated as ace, the term refers to an individual who does not experience sexual attraction. Each asexual person experiences relationships, attraction, and arousal differently. Asexuality is distinct from chosen behavior such as celibacy or sexual abstinence; asexuality is a sexual orientation that does not necessarily entail specific chosen behaviors. Asexual people exist on a spectrum of sexual attraction and can use terms such as gray asexual or gray ace to describe themselves. Assigned Sex: The sex assigned to an infant at birth based on the child’s visible sex organs, including genitalia and other physical characteristics. Assumed Gender: The gender assumed about an individual, based on their assigned sex as well as apparent societal gender markers and expectations, such as physical attributes and expressed characteristics. Examples of assuming a person’s gender include using pronouns for a person before learning what pronouns they use or calling a person a man or a woman without knowing their gender. Bi-curious: A term used to identify a person who is interested in exploring their attraction to people of a variety of genders. Many view this term as offensive, as it implies that sexual orientation is something that must be explored sexually and romantically before it can be determined (see Heteroflexible). Additionally, many feel that this term invalidates bisexuality by implying that it is a questioning or exploratory phase, instead of a valid sexual orientation. Similar to the term queer, use this term only when self-identifying or when quoting someone who self-identifies as bi-curious. Bigender: While gender is now widely understood to be a spectrum and not on a binary, this is a term used to identify a person whose gender identity encompasses two genders, (often man and woman, but not exclusively) or is moving between two genders. More commonly used terms include genderfluid (see Genderfluid) or genderqueer (see Genderqueer), which better reflect the spectrum of all genders. Binary: Refers to someone who fits into the gender binary (see Gender Binary). Binding: The process of tightly wrapping one’s chest in order to minimize the appearance of having breasts, often by using a binder. Note: One must bind themselves carefully, with appropriate materials, and for reasonable periods of time in order to avoid discomfort and potential negative health impacts. Unsafe binding can lead to negative health outcomes, such as broken ribs and trouble breathing. Bioessentialism: Short for biological essentialism. Reliance or weaponization of biology in an attempt to disprove trans people’s genders. Common bioessentialist arguments reduce people to their chromosomes (though there are more than 30 chromosome combinations that people have); their genitalia (though there are many natural variations; or their binary gender (though gender and sex are not binary). Biological Sex: Refers to anatomical, physiological, genetic, or physical attributes that determine if a person is male, female, or intersex. These include both primary and secondary sex characteristics, including genitalia, gonads, hormone levels, hormone receptors, chromosomes, and genes. Often also referred to as “sex,” “physical sex,” “anatomical sex,” or specifically as “sex assigned at birth.” Biological sex is often conflated or interchanged with gender, which is more societal than biological, and involves personal identity factors. Biphobia: Animosity, hatred, or dislike of bisexual people (see Bisexual) which may manifest in the form of prejudice or bias. Biphobia often stems from lack of knowledge about bisexual people and the issues they face, and can sometimes be alleviated with education and support. Related to homophobia (see Homophobia) and transphobia (see Transphobia). Bisexual: Commonly referred to as bi or bi+. According to bi+ educator and advocate Robyn Ochs, the term refers to a person who acknowledges in themselves the potential to be attracted--romantically, emotionally and/or sexually--to people of more than one gender, not necessarily at the same time, in the same way, or in the same degree. The "bi" in bisexual can refer to attraction to genders similar to and different from one's own. People who identify as bisexual need not have had equal sexual or romantic experience—or equal levels of attraction—with people across genders, nor any experience at all; attraction and self-identification determines orientation. Bottom Surgery: Surgery performed on an individual’s reproductive system as a part of gender-affirming surgery. (See Gender-Affirming Surgery.) Not all trans people undergo medical interventions as part of their transition. As with any other aspect of transition, trans people retain the right not to discuss their surgical history, and surgery does not define gender. Butch: A person who is masculine of center in dress, attitude, and/or presentation. It is often, but not exclusively, used in a lesbian context. Often on a spectrum from butch to femme (see Femme) or stud (see Stud) to femme. Chosen Family: Also known as Found Family, people who support an LGBTQ+ person, who are not biologically related, and who often fill the role of the biological family if an LGBTQ+ person’s family is not supportive of them. Cisgender (pronounced sis-gender): A term used to refer to an individual whose gender identity aligns with the one associated with the sex assigned to them at birth. The prefix cis- comes from the Latin word for “on the same side as.” People who are both cisgender and heterosexual are sometimes referred to as cishet (pronounced “cis-het”) individuals. The term cisgender is not a slur. People who are not trans should avoid calling themselves “normal” and instead refer to themselves as cisgender or cis. Cisnormativity: The assumption that everyone is cisgender and that being cisgender is superior to all other genders. This includes the often implicitly held idea that being cisgender is the norm and that other genders are “different” or “abnormal.” Cissexism: Prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination on the basis of sex, specifically towards transgender and gender-expansive people (see Transphobia). Closeted: Describes a person who is not open about their sexual orientation or gender identity. A closeted person may be referred to as being “in the closet.” There are many degrees to being out/closeted; closeted individuals may be out (see Out) to just themselves, close friends, or to their larger network, or not publically open about their status as LGBTQ+ people. Coming Out: For LGBTQ+ people, coming out is the process of self-identifying and self-acceptance that entails the sharing of their identity with others. Sometimes referred to as disclosing (see Disclosure). Individuals often recognize a lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender/gender-expansive, or queer identity within themselves first, and then might choose to reveal it to others. There are many different degrees of being out, and coming out is a lifelong process. Coming out can be an incredibly personal and transformative experience. It is critical to respect where each person is within their process of self-identification, and up to each person, individually, to decide if and when and to whom to come out or disclose. Culturally Queer: From the Queerspawn Resource Project: Living Language Guide, “Speaks to the feeling shared by many people with LGBTQ+ parents that they grew up immersed in queer culture, including traditions, celebrations, media, and language. Queerspawn are often raised in the queer community and learn about society primarily through a queer lens, and experience heterosexual culture and its norms as a secondary cultural influence.” Deadnaming: Occurs when an individual, intentionally or not, refers to the name that a transgender or gender-expansive individual used at a different time in their life. Avoid this practice, as it can cause trauma, stress, embarrassment, and even danger. Some may prefer the terms birth name, given name, or old name. Demiboy: A person whose gender identity is only partly male, regardless of their assigned sex at birth. Demigirl: A person whose gender identity is only partly female, regardless of their assigned sex at birth. Demiromantic: Used to describe an individual who experiences romantic attraction only after forming an emotional connection. Demisexual: Used to describe an individual who experiences sexual attraction only after forming an emotional connection. Disclosure: A word that some people use to describe the act or process of revealing one’s transgender or gender-expansive identity to another person in a specific instance. Some find the term offensive, implying the need to disclose something shameful, and prefer to use the term coming out, whereas others find coming out offensive, and prefer to use disclosure. Drag: The theatrical performance of one or multiple genders (often including makeup, costume, dance, lip-syncing, and temporary body modifications). Performers who present in a feminine manner are called Drag Queens, while performers who present in a masculine manner are called Drag Kings. These performances often push traditional boundaries of gender presentation, calling into question societally defined gender roles. Dyke: A queer woman or AFAB person. While some believe it to only describe masculine lesbians, many bisexual and gender-expansive people also connect to this term. Traditionally a slur, the term has been reclaimed and should only be used to self identify or to refer to the way someone else has identified themselves, i.e., “She identifies as a dyke.” Femme: A person who is feminine of center in dress, attitude, and/or presentation. It is often, but not exclusively, used in a lesbian context. Often on a spectrum from butch (see Butch) to femme or stud (see Stud) to femme. Folx: An alternative spelling to folks. The two words are pronounced the same way. Folx is viewed by some as a more inclusive version of the word folks, though both are gender-neutral ways of addressing a group of people. FTM/F2M: An abbreviation of Female to Male; a transgender man. FTX/F2X: A genderqueer or gender-expansive person assigned female at birth. Gay: An term used to describe people who are emotionally, romantically, and/or physically attracted to people of the same gender (e.g., gay man, gay people). In contemporary contexts, lesbian is often a preferred term for women, though many women use the term gay to describe themselves. People who are gay need not have had any sexual experience. Attraction and self-identification determines sexual orientation, not the gender or sexual orientation of one’s partner. The term should not be used as an umbrella term for LGBTQ+ people, e.g. “the gay community,” because it excludes other sexual orientations and genders. Avoid using gay in a disparaging manner, e.g. “that’s so gay,” as a synonym for bad. Gayby: A person with one or more LGBTQ+ parent or caregiver. Typically, a term used for self identification only. Gender Binary: The disproven concept that there are only two genders, male and female, and that everyone must be one or the other. Also often misused to assert that gender is biologically determined. This concept also reinforces the idea that men and women are opposites and have different roles in society (see Gender Roles). Gender Dysphoria: The distress caused when a person's assigned sex at birth and assumed gender is not the same as the one with which they identify. According to the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the term "...is intended to better characterize the experiences of affected children, adolescents, and adults." Gender Euphoria: A euphoric feeling often experienced when one’s gender is recognized and respected by others, when one’s body aligns with one’s gender, or when one expresses themselves in accordance with their gender. Focusing on gender euphoria instead of gender dysphoria shifts focus towards the positive aspects of being transgender or gender expansive. Gender Expansive: An umbrella term sometimes used to describe people who expand notions of gender expression and identity beyond perceived or expected societal gender norms. Some gender-expansive individuals identify as a mix of genders, some identify more binarily as a man or a woman, and some identify as no gender (see agender). Gender-expansive people might feel that they exist among genders, as on a spectrum, or beyond the notion of the man/woman binary paradigm. Sometimes gender-expansive people use gender-neutral pronouns (see Pronouns), but people can exist as any gender while using any pronouns. They may or may not be comfortable with their bodies as they are, regardless of how they express their gender. Gender Expression: The manner in which a person communicates about gender to others through external means such as clothing, appearance, or mannerisms. This communication may be conscious or subconscious and may or may not reflect their gender identity or sexual orientation. While most people’s understandings of gender expressions relate to masculinity and femininity, there are countless combinations that may incorporate both masculine and feminine expressions—or neither—through androgynous expressions. An individual’s gender expression does not automatically imply one’s gender identity. All people have gender expressions. Gender Identity: A person’s deeply held core sense of self in relation to gender (see Gender). Gender identity does not always correspond to biological sex. People become aware of their gender identity at many different stages of life, from as early as 18 months and into adulthood. According to Gender Spectrum, one study showed that “...the average age of self-realization for the child that they were transgender or non-binary was 7.9 years old, but the average age when they disclosed their understanding of their gender was 15.5 years old.” Gender identity is a separate concept from sexuality (see Sexual Orientation) and gender expression (see Gender Expression). Gender Neutral: Not gendered. Can refer to language (including pronouns and salutations/titles—see Gender-neutral salutations or titles), spaces (like bathrooms), or other aspects of society (like colors or occupations). Gender neutral is not a term to describe people (see Gender Expansive). A person who experiences no gender may be agender (see Agender) or neutrois (see Neutrois). Gender Nonconforming (GNC): A term for those who do not follow gender stereotypes. Often an umbrella for nonbinary genders (see TGNC). Though fairly uncommon, some people view the term as derogatory, so they may use other terms including gender expansive, differently gendered, gender creative, gender variant, genderqueer, nonbinary, agender, genderfluid, gender neutral, bigender, androgynous, or gender diverse. It is important to respect and use the terms people use for themselves, regardless of any prior associations or ideas about those terms. Gender Performance Theory: Coined by Judith Butler, gender performance theory is the concept that people do not have inherent genders based on their biological sex. According to this theory, people continually perform their genders, instead of relying on their assigned sexes to determine their genders for them. Gender Roles: The strict set of societal beliefs that dictate the so-called acceptable behaviors for people of different genders, usually binary in nature. Many people find these to be restrictive and harmful, as they reinforce the gender binary (see Gender Binary). Gender Socialization: A process that influences and teaches an individual how to behave as a man or a woman, based on culturally defined gender roles (see Gender Roles). Parents, teachers, peers, media, and faith traditions are some of the many agents of gender socialization. Gender socialization looks very different across cultures, both inside and outside of the U.S. It is heavily impacted by other intersecting identities (see Intersectionality). Gender Spectrum: The concept that gender exists beyond a simple man/woman binary model (see Gender Binary), but instead exists on a continuum. Some people fall towards more masculine or feminine aspects, some people move fluidly along the spectrum, and some exist off the spectrum entirely. Gender Variant: A term often used by the medical community to describe individuals who dress, behave, or express themselves in a way that does not conform to dominant gender norms (see Gender Expansive). People outside the medical community tend to avoid this term because it suggests that these identities are abnormal, preferring terms such as gender expansive. Gender-Affirming Surgery (GAS): Surgical procedures that can help people adjust their bodies to match their innate gender identity more closely. Used interchangeably with gender affirmation, gender confirmation, and gender-confirming surgery. Not every transgender person will desire or have resources for gender-affirming surgery. Use this term in place of the older term sex change. Also sometimes referred to as gender reassignment surgery, genital reconstruction surgery, or medical transition. (See Top Surgery and Bottom Surgery). Gender-Neutral Salutations or Titles: A salutation or title that does not specify the gender of the addressee in a formal communication or introduction. Also used for persons who do not identify as a binary gender, addressing someone where the gender is unknown, or if the correspondence-sender is unsure of the gender of the person to whom the correspondence is being sent. Mx. (pronounced mix) and M. are the most commonly used gender-neutral salutations (e.g. “Dear Mx. Smith…” or “Hello M. Moore…:). Generally, M. is used when the gender is unknown, and Mx. is used when the person uses that prefix. Gender: Broadly, gender is a set of socially constructed roles, behaviors, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate (see Social Construction Theory). Genderfluid: Describes a person who does not consistently adhere to one fixed gender and who may move among genders. Genderqueer: Refers to individuals who blur preconceived boundaries of gender in relation to the gender binary (See Gender Binary); they can also reject commonly held ideas of static gender identities. Sometimes used as an umbrella term in much the same way that the term queer is used, but only refers to gender, and thus should only be used when self-identifying or quoting someone who uses the term genderqueer for themselves. Hermaphrodite: An offensive term for someone who is intersex (see Intersex). The term has valid uses within academic circles relating to the study of non-human animals and plants but should not be used to describe humans. Heteroflexible: A straight person who is most often attracted to people of a different gender from themselves but sometimes experiences attraction to people of the same gender as them. It is distinct from bisexuality. The term can have negative connotations of experimentation or indecision (see Bi-curious). Heteronormativity: The assumption that everyone is heterosexual and that heterosexuality is superior to all other sexualities. This includes the often implicitly held idea that heterosexuality is the norm and that other sexualities are “different” or “abnormal.” Heterosexual: Refers to a person who is emotionally, romantically, and/or physically attracted to a person of a different gender. Also referred to as straight. Homoflexible: A gay person who is most often attracted to people of the same gender as themselves but sometimes experience attraction to people of other genders or engage in sexual behavior with people of different genders from their own. It is distinct from bisexuality (see Bisexual). Homophobia: Animosity, hatred, or dislike of LGBTQ+ people that often manifests itself in the form of prejudice and bias. Homophobia often stems from lack of knowledge about LGBTQ+ people and the issues they face and can sometimes be alleviated with education and support. Related to biphobia (see Biphobia) and transphobia (see Transphobia). Homosexual: A term to describe gay, lesbian, or queer people which may be offensive depending on the speaker. Originally used as a scientific or clinical term to describe LGBTQ+ people, the word has been reclaimed by the LGBTQ+ community and may be colloquially used by an LGBTQ+ person to reference themselves or another member of the community. Non-LGBTQ+ people should avoid using the term. Hormone Blockers (also referred to as Puberty Blockers): Medical treatment which allows young trans and gender-expansive people to prevent the potentially negative outcomes of going through a puberty that does not match their gender identity. Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT): Treatment which allows trans and gender-expansive people to medically transition or feel more at home in their bodies (see Gender-Affirming Surgery and Transition). Those taking testosterone (masculinizing hormones) may grow more facial/body hair and notice their voices deepening. Those taking estrogen (feminizing hormones) may see some breast growth and decreased libido. Many intersex people take HRT to balance the naturally occurring levels of estrogen and testosterone in their bodies. Benefits of such therapy can include improved mental and physical wellness, and reduced anxiety and dysphoria, for those who experience it. House-Ballroom Community: The underground subculture consisting of mainly Black and Latinx members of the LGBTQ+ community who ‘walk’ to earn recognition and awards within their community. ‘Houses’ are chosen families that individuals compete with and often live with (see Chosen Family).These categories represent the barriers that Queer and Trans People of Color (QTPOC) face in accessing formal employment, housing, and public services. Hyperfemininity: Term for the exaggeration of stereotypically female behavior, based on so-called gender roles (see Gender Roles). Hyperfeminine behavior is often expected of trans women in order to be seen as “real” women. Hypermasculinity: Term for the exaggeration of stereotypically male behavior, based on so-called gender roles (see Gender Roles). Hypermasculine behavior is often expected of trans men in order to be seen as “real” men. Heterosexual men may display hypermasculine behaviors to “prove” that they are not gay, even though gay men have many understandings of their own masculinity. Intersectionality: Coined by Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw, this term refers to the overlap of social categorizations or identities such as race and ethnicity, sexuality, gender, disability, geography, and class which exist in an individual or group of people that can contribute to discrimination or disadvantage. Intersex: Intersex is the current term used to refer to people who are biologically between the medically expected definitions of male and female. This can be through variations in hormones, chromosomes, internal or external genitalia, or any combination of any or all primary and/or secondary sex characteristics. While many intersex people are noticed as intersex at birth, many are not. As intersex is about biological sex, it is distinct from gender identity and sexual orientation. An intersex person can be of any gender identity and can also be of any sexual orientation and any romantic orientation. The Intersex Society of North America opposes the practice of genital mutilation on infants and children who are intersex. Formerly, the medical terms hermaphrodite and pseudohermaphrodite were used; these terms are now considered neither acceptable nor scientifically accurate. Kinsey Scale: A scale developed in the 1940s by Alfred Kinsey which places an individual’s sexual orientation on a spectrum from 0 (exclusively heterosexual) to 6 (exclusivley homosexual). The scale included the measurement “X” which indicated an absence of sexual behavior. The scale was an early recognition of fluid sexual orientation and was credited with challenging the heterosexual/homosexual binary. Latinx: (Pronounced Latin-ex or la-TEEN-ex) An inclusive, gender-neutral term--sometimes used in place of the gendered, binary terms Latino or Latina--used to describe a person of Latin-American origin or descent. While many in the progressive space use this term, 2019 Pew research shows that, while one-in-four U.S. Hispanics have heard the term, only 23% of U.S. adults who self-identify as Hispanic or Latino have heard the term, and just 3% say they use it to describe themselves. Lesbian: Refers to a woman who is emotionally, romantically, and/or physically attracted to other women. People who are lesbians need not have had any sexual experience: Attraction and self-identification determines orientation, not the gender or sexual orientation of one’s partner. As an adjective, used to refer to female same-sex attraction and sexual behavior; as a noun, used as a sexual orientation identity label by women whose sexual attractions and behaviors are exclusively or mainly directed to other women. LGBTQ+: An acronym that collectively refers to individuals who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer, sometimes stated as LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) or, historically, GLBT (gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender). The addition of the Q for queer is a more recently preferred version of the acronym as cultural opinions of the term queer focus increasingly on its positive, reclaimed definition (see Queer). The Q can also stand for questioning, referring to those who are still exploring their own sexuality and/or gender. The “+” represents those who are part of the community, but for whom LGBTQ does not accurately capture or reflect their identity. Lifestyle: A previously used and offensive term used to describe LGBTQ+ people’s sexual orientation and gender expression/identity as a “choice.” Lived Experience: To value the personal experiences of individuals as much as quantitative data. For example, believing narratives of discrimination against LGBTQ+ people persisting even if they counter larger narratives of acceptance. The concept of lived experience as a criterion on meaning was coined by Patricia Hill Collins. Misgender: To refer to someone using a word, especially a pronoun or form of address, which does not correctly reflect their gender. This may be unintentional and without ill intent or can be a maliciously employed expression of bias. Regardless of intent, misgendering has a harmful impact. Misogynoir: A term coined by queer Black feminist Moya Bailey to describe misogyny directed towards Black women where race and gender both play roles in bias. Mispronoun: Similar to misgendering (see Misgender), mispronouning is to refer to a person with the incorrect pronouns. This term is less common than misgendering, as pronouns are often an important aspect of people’s genders. This may be unintentional and without ill intent, or can be a maliciously employed expression of bias. Regardless of intent, mispronouning has a harmful impact. MLM: Men Loving Men, refers to gay, bisexual, pansexual or otherwise same-gender loving men. Used most commonly within the Black community, the term is more often written than used in conversation. Monogamous: A term referring to individuals who are intimate or involved romantically with one person at a time. Monolith: Refers to a large single upright block of stone, formally, and a group or organization with unified and unchanging attributes, informally. In context, the term monolith is used to show that “[group of people] are not a monolith.” It means that members of a group have varying experiences, and the voice of one member of the group should not be taken as a representation of the experiences of all members of that group. Monosexism: The opinion that being attracted to one gender is superior to being attracted to multiple genders. Monosexual: People who only experience attraction to one gender. Examples of monosexual groups include gay men, lesbians, and straight people. MSM: Men Who Have Sex with Men. Reports on STIs and public health commonly use this term, although those who identify as MSM might or might not identify as members of the LGBTQ+ community. This designation often allows discrimination against GBTQ+ men, for example in blood donation. MTF/M2F: A trans woman/trans feminine person assigned male at birth. MTX/M2X: A genderqueer or gender-expansive person assigned male at birth. Nibling: A gender-neutral term for niece/nephew. Nonbinary Lesbian: A term to describe a nonbinary person whose primary romantic, emotional and/or sexual attraction is to women. Lesbianism has historically included people of varying gender expressions (see Butch, Stud and Femme) and people with varying relationships to the lesbian community (before bisexual and pansexual came into common use, any woman who felt romantic, emotional and/or sexual attraction to women was considered a lesbian). This combination of terms came about due to the lack of a specific term for a nonbinary person who is only attracted to one gender. Nonbinary: Refers to people who do not subscribe to the gender binary. They might exist between or beyond the man-woman binary. Some use the term exclusively, while others may use it interchangeably with terms like genderqueer (see Genderqueer), genderfluid (see Genderfluid), gender nonconforming (see Gender Nonconforming), gender diverse, or gender expansive. It can also be combined with other descriptors e.g. nonbinary woman or transmasc nonbinary. Language is imperfect, so it’s important to trust and respect the words that nonbinary people use to describe their genders and experiences. Nonbinary people may understand their identity as falling under the transgender umbrella, and may thus be transgender as well. Sometimes abbreviated as NB or Enby, the term NB has historically been used to mean non-Black, so those referring to non-binary people should avoid using NB. Opposite Sex: Inaccurate descriptor of gender, implying that there are only two genders that oppose one another. Also an inaccurate descriptor of sex, as biological sexes are also not opposites (see Intersex). Better terms include different gender or AMAB/AFAB, depending on context. Out: A term which describes people who openly self-identify as LGBTQ+ in their private, public, and/or professional lives. There are many states of being out; individuals can be out only to themselves, close friends, or everyone. Some transgender people prefer to use the term disclose (see Disclosure). Outing: The deliberate or accidental sharing of another person’s sexual orientation or gender identity without their explicit consent. Outing is disrespectful and presents a danger for many LGBTQ+ individuals. Pansexual: Refers to a person whose emotional, romantic and/or physical attraction is to people inclusive of all genders. People who are pansexual need not have had any sexual experience: It is the attraction and self-identification that determine the orientation. Pansexuality and bisexuality are different; pansexuality includes all genders equally, whereas bisexuality can favor some genders over others (see Bisexual). Passing: With sexuality, the act of presenting as straight (see Beard). With gender, the act of presenting as cisgender or gender-typical, which is generally accomplished through conforming to gender roles (see Gender Roles). People may try to pass in anti-LGBTQ+ environments to ensure their safety. People who pass as straight or cis have the choice to either talk about their LGBTQ+ experience or to “fit in” to a cis- and hetero-normative world. Passing is not required for LGBTQ+ people to deserve respect and love. Polyamorous: A term used to describe people who have the desire for multiple consenting intimate relationships at the same time. Also referred to as “ethically non-monogamous,” “polya” or “polyam;” there is a movement away from shortening polyamorous to “poly” since poly already means Polynesian. Consent and transparency are key components of polyamorous relationships. Positive: Shorthand for being HIV+. In context, “I’m positive” is a disclosure of a person’s HIV status. It is never appropriate to share a person’s HIV status without their explicit consent. Refrain from discussing a person’s HIV status unless they bring up the topic. Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP): This is an emergency prescription antiretroviral medication to be taken within 72 hours of possible exposure to HIV. Possible exposure includes during sex, sharing needles to inject drugs, or if you have been sexually assaulted. Though PEP is highly effective in preventing HIV, it should not be taken in place of other HIV prevention measures, such as taking PrEP (see PrEP) or practicing safe sex. Pre-, Post-, or Non-Operative (or -Op): The terms used to describe the surgery status of a transgender person. Pre-Op means that a person has not had gender-affirming surgery (See Gender-Affirming Surgery) and may or may not plan to. Post-Op means that an individual has had gender-affirming surgery. Non-Op means that a person does not plan to have gender-affirming surgery. The choice to have gender-affirming surgery is highly personal and does not affect the validity of a person’s gender identity. Refrain from discussing a trans person’s surgical history or future unless they bring up the topic. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP): A presciption medication those at higher risk for HIV take to prevent getting HIV from sex or injection drug use. Though PrEP is highly effective in preventing HIV, it should not be taken in place of other HIV prevention measures, such practicing safe sex and not sharing drug-related injection equipment. Preference: A preference is a specific set of desires people have in romantic, emotional and/or sexual partners. People’s sexual orientations are not preferences, but they can have preferences (e.g. having a “type”) in the people they become involved with. Preferences can be logistical (e.g. lives within a certain distance, not looking for a relationship) and interest based (e.g. likes to stay in, enjoys long walks on the beach). They can also be influenced by personal and systemic prejudices (e.g. not considering people whose gender expressions do not conform to conventional standards of that gender, people whose bodies are not conventionally attractive, or people with other marginalized identities). People can have their own preferences but should consider examining why they hold these preferences in order to make sure they are not reproducing inequalities. Pronouns: The words used to refer to a person other than their name. Common pronouns are they/them, he/him, and she/her. Neopronouns are pronouns created to be specifically gender-neutral including xe/xem, ze/zir and fae/faer. Pronouns are sometimes called Personal Gender Pronouns, or PGPs. For those who use pronouns--and not all people do--they are not preferred, they are essential. Additional Pronoun Resources PTP: Acronym for Person with a Transgender Parent (see Transpawn) QTPOC: Acronym for Queer and Trans People of Color. This term emphasizes the intersections (see Intersectionality) of race, gender, and sexual orientation. Queer: A term used by some LGBTQ+ people to describe themselves and/or their community. Reclaimed from its earlier negative use—and valued by some for its defiance—the term is also considered by some to be inclusive of the entire community, and by others who find it to be an appropriate term to describe their more fluid identities. Traditionally a negative or pejorative term for people who are LGBTQ+, some people within the community dislike the term. Due to its varying meanings, use this word only when self-identifying or quoting someone who self-identifies as queer (i.e. “My cousin identifies as queer” or “My cousin is a queer person”). Queerbaiting: A marketing technique in which media creators or executives allude to the presence of LGBTQ+ characters or relationships within their content, but fail to include actual representation so as not to lose non-LGBTQ+ viewers. Queerspawn: A person with one or more LGBTQ+ parent or caregiver. Typically a term used for self-identification. Questioning: Describes those who are in a process of discovery and exploration about their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or a combination thereof. Questioning people can be of any age, so for many reasons, this may happen later in life. Questioning is a profoundly important process, and one that does not imply that someone is choosing to be lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer. Same-Gender Loving (SGL): A term coined by Cleo Manago, and sometimes used by some members of the Black community or people of African descent, to express sexual orientation without relying on terms and symbols of European descent. Sapphic: Drawn from the Greek lesbian poet Sappho’s name, a term used to refer to lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, or otherwise same-gender loving (see SGL) women. Sex Worker: Abbreviated as SWer. A person who engages in sexual activity for payment. Often considered a more respectful term than prostitute or hooker. SWERF is an acronym for Sex Worker Exclusionary Radical Feminist (pronounced “swurf”). SWERFs exclude sex workers from feminist organizations with the belief that sex work is not work. Sexual Orientation: Emotional, romantic, or sexual feelings toward other people or no people (see Asexual). While sexual activity involves the choices one makes regarding behavior, one’s sexual activity does not define one’s sexual orientation. Sexual orientation is part of the human condition, and all people have one. Typically, it is attraction that helps determine orientation. It also may refer to a person’s choice of whether or not to engage in sexual relationships and practices. Social Construction Theory: The idea that many of the institutions, expectations, and identities that we consider natural have been created and shaped by societies and people who came before us. Things that are socially constructed still have very real influences and consequences, even if they are not based in an inherent truth. Social constructs can be reconstructed in order to better fit the society and culture they govern. SOGI: Acronym for Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity. It is typically used as a shorthand in writing and is rarely pronounced out loud. Stealth: A term used to describe transgender or gender-expansive individuals who do not disclose their gender identity in their public or private lives (or certain aspects of their public and private lives). For example, a person might go stealth in a job interview. Increasingly considered offensive by some, as to them it implies an element of deception. Some use the phrase maintaining privacy instead, while others use both terms interchangeably. Additionally, passing is an alternative term which, for some, has fewer negative connotations. Stud: A term for Black lesbians who take on a more butch (see Butch) or masculine role. Also known as ag/aggressive or butch. This term is not appropriate for non-Black lesbians to use. Often on a spectrum from butch to femme (see Femme) or stud to femme. Survival Sex: Term for sexual activity performed in exchange for goods or services. Also known as transactional sex. Since LGBTQ+ people are more likely to be denied fair housing and employment, some may rely on sex to get them a place to sleep or the money they need. T4T: Abbreviation of Trans 4 Trans. A trans or gender-expansive person who is only interested in emotional, romantic, intimate, and/or sexual partnerships with other trans people. It centers the beauty of being trans by celebrating the diversity of trans experience. T4T relationships allow trans people space from having to explain their genders or experiences to cisgender partners. TERF: Acronym for Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist (pronounced “turf”). The term TERF originated online in 2008 from trans inclusive cisgender radical feminist blogger Viv Smythe; however exclusion of trans people--especially trans women--from feminist organizing spaces has been gaining traction since the 1970s. TERFs primarily believe that trans women are men trying to invade women’s spaces, and work aggressively to deny the existence and identity of transgender people. TGNC: Initialism for trans and gender nonconforming. An umbrella term for people who are not cisgender. It is pronounced T-G-N-C, but is more commonly written than spoken. Top Surgery: Surgery performed on an individual’s chest/breasts as a part of gender-affirming surgery. (See Gender-Affirming Surgery.) For AFAB people, this can be a chest reduction or a full removal. For AMAB people, this can be an increase in chest size using saline or silicone. Trancestors: An informal term for trans elders, coming from a combination of the words “transgender” and “ancestors.” The term highlights the fact that many trans people do not get to grow old, and celebrates intergenerational relationships. Trancestors can be well-known within the movement or personal to a community, filling a parent or grandparent-like role (see Chosen Family). Trancestors can make an impact during and after their lives, and prove that there is a long history of transgender people throughout the world. Trans-antagonistic: Active hostility towards trans and gender-expansive people with the goal of enacting harm. Transfeminine: An AMAB person who is closer to femininity than masculinity but is not a binary woman. Often abbreviated to transfem or transfemme. Transgender: Often shortened to trans, from the Latin prefix for “on a different side as.” A term describing a person’s gender identity that does not necessarily match their assigned sex at birth. Transgender people may or may not decide to alter their bodies hormonally and/or surgically to match their gender identity. This word is also used as an umbrella term to describe groups of people who transcend conventional expectations of gender identity or expression—such groups include, but are not limited to, people who identify as transsexual, genderqueer, gender variant, gender diverse, and androgynous. See above for common acronyms and terms including female to male (or FTM), male to female (or MTF), assigned male at birth (or AMAB), assigned female at birth (or AFAB), nonbinary, and gender-expansive. Trans is often considered more inclusive than transgender because it includes transgender, transsexual, transmasc, transfem, and those who simply use the word trans. Transition: A term used to refer to the process—social, legal, and/or medical—one goes through to affirm one’s gender identity. This may, but does not always, include taking hormones; having surgeries; and changing names, pronouns, identification documents, and more. Many individuals choose not to or are unable to transition for a wide range of reasons both within and beyond their control. The validity of an individual’s gender identity does not depend on any social, legal, and/or medical transition; the self-identification itself is what validates the gender identity. Transmasculine: An AFAB person who is closer to masculinity than femininity but is not a binary man. Often abbreviated to transmasc. Transmedicalism: Also known as truscum, transmedicalists are people, both trans and cisgender, who believe gender dysphoria and the desire to medically transition are criteria to being legitimately trans. Transmisogynoir: Misogyny directed against trans and gender-expansive Black women, that often manifests itself in the form of prejudice and bias. Transmisogyny: Misogyny directed against trans and gender-expansive women that often manifests itself in the form of prejudice and bias. Transpawn: A person with one or more transgender or non-binary parent or caregiver. Typically, a term used for self identification only. Transphobia: Animosity, hatred, or dislike of trans and gender-expansive people that often manifests itself in the form of prejudice and bias. Transphobia often stems from lack of knowledge about transgender people and the issues they face and can be alleviated with education and support (see Trans-antagonistic for those whose aversion manifests in active oppression). Related to biphobia (see Biphobia) and homophobia (see Homophobia). Transsexual: A term which refers to people who consider or use medical interventions such as hormone therapy or gender-affirming surgeries, also called sex reassignment surgery (SRS) or pursue medical interventions as part of the process of expressing their gender. A less frequently used—and sometimes misunderstood—term (considered by some to be outdated or possibly offensive, and others to be uniquely applicable to them). Some transsexual people do not identify as transgender and vice versa. Like the term queer, due to its varying meanings, use this term only when self-identifying or quoting someone who self-identifies as transsexual. Two-Spirit: A term used within some American Indian (AI) and Alaska Native (AN) communities to refer to a person who identifies as having both a male and a female essence or spirit. The term, created in 1990 by a group of AI/AN activists at an annual Native LGBTQ conference, encompasses sexual, cultural, gender, and spiritual identities, and provides unifying, positive, and encouraging language that emphasizes reconnecting to tribal traditions. Non-indigenous people should not use this term. (With thanks to Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board [NPAIHB].) The term derives from the northern Algonquin term niizh manitoag, meaning “two spirits,” and refers to the inclusion of both feminine and masculine components in one individual (Anguksuar, 1997). Voguing: A highly stylized, modern, street-style dance, stemming from New York City ballroom culture [particularly in neighborhoods-of-color in Harlem and the Bronx] in the late 1980s. Vogue was created and has been nurtured by Black and Latinx LGBTQ+ people inspired by Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphics, as well as poses found in Vogue Magazine. WLW: Women Loving Women, refers to lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, or otherwise same-gender loving women (pronounced “W-L-W” or “wuh-luh-wuh”). Often used in communities of color, this specification grew from the historical notion that any woman who had emotional, romantic, intimate, and/or sexual partnerships with women as lesbians. As more understandings of sexuality have come to light, WLW has largely replaced lesbian as a unifying term to describe these women. WSW: An abbreviation for Women Who Have Sex with Women. Reports on STIs and in public health commonly use this term, although those who identify as WSW may or may not identify as members of the LGBTQ+ community. Adapted from the Institute of Medicine’s report, The Health of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People: Building a Foundation for Better Understanding (2011) and PFLAG’s National Glossary of Terms

Latinx LGBTQ+ Pride: A Conversation with Dr. Erik Rodriquez [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://edi.nih.gov/the-EDI-blog/latinx-lgbtq-pride-conversation-dr-erik-rodriquez)

> Latinx LGBTQ+ Pride: A Conversation with Dr. Erik Rodriquez Bali White Bali is the Principal Strategist for the Sexual and Gender Minorities Portfolio within EDI. It is her role to gain a greater understanding of how the NIH workplace serves SGM employees; this work includes insights regarding recruitment, retention, and advancement, as well as efforts to increase SGM engagement and offer recommendations on current and future NIH policies and diversity and inclusion strategies. With an academic background in cultural studies and languages as well as extensive professional experience in public health, Bali joined the NIH Academy in 2014 as an Intramural Research Training Awardee, assigned to the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research. During that time, she presented research posters across the NIH, on Capitol Hill, and at the International AIDS Conference in South Africa regarding intersectional impacts on the health of African American women of transgender experience in NYC. Erik J. Rodriquez, PhD Dr. Erik J. Rodriquez is a biobehavioral epidemiologist and staff scientist in the Division of Intramural Research at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), where he conducts population health research in the Minority Health and Health Disparities Population Laboratory. He specializes in tobacco use behaviors, social determinants of health behaviors, and behavior-related health disparities among racial/ethnic minority and immigrant populations. His past research has investigated relationships between acculturation-, stress-, mental health-, and age-related factors and health behavior. His experience also includes research in the fields of premature mortality, occupational health, and applied public health. Dr. Rodriquez received his Master of Public Health (MPH) degree from Loma Linda University; postgraduate training from the California Department of Public Health; his PhD from the University of California, Davis; and postdoctoral training from the University of California, San Francisco. Bali: Tell me about Latinx Pride. What’s it like? Erik: Latinx Pride is a space for Latinx LGBTQ+ individuals to celebrate their intersectional LGBTQ+ and Latinx cultural identities. Several cities across the country hold, or have held, such events parallel to existing pride events. These spaces and events highlight individuals in the LGBTQ+ community who are often underrepresented and marginalized because of their ethnicity, language preferences, and immigration statuses. Bali: What’s the significance of the use of the term Latinx? Erik: The term Latinx first came about in the early 2000s. It is a US-based term that removes the grammatical gender of Latina (feminine) or Latino (masculine). This term is generally viewed as being more inclusive of non-binary gender identities and challenges the gender binary nature of language by introducing a gender-neutral term to the English language. LGBTQ+ individuals who speak other languages in other countries, such as those who speak Spanish in South America, use a similar gender-neutral term: Latine. Bali: Do you remember the first time you attended/participated? Erik: The first time I attended a Latinx Pride was in downtown Los Angeles about 20+ years ago. After years of not seeing any LGBTQ+ people who look like me in LGBTQ+ media and at LGBTQ+ events, to see other Latinx LGBTQ+ individuals felt validating and relieved some of my feelings of isolation. Bali: How is it different from the traditional pride here in DC? Erik: The main event of DC Latinx Pride is a dance party at a local venue that centers Latinx music, dancing, local performers, and Latinx LGBTQ+ organizations in addition to mainstream music and dancing that you would generally hear and see at a similar event. The organization that holds DC Latinx Pride, the Latinx History Project (LHP), also holds other Latinx LGBTQ+ events throughout the year. Bali: We’ve discussed labels before. How do you identify? Erik: I generally identify as a gay Latino. However, I don’t get too caught up in using the most precise label for myself. The labels I use are for others to quickly understand a few aspects of my identity, not for me on which to attach my self-worth or self-value. Bali: How do you feel/experience/connect to the larger gay community? Erik: Honestly, it can be a challenge. Much of the gay community in which I’ve grown up has been white, male, cisgender, privileged, and generally not interested in people who do not fit into those categories. So, much of the racism I have experienced over my life has come from the larger gay community. Some of that is changing as a few big-city pride events have recognized the importance of other movements such as the civil rights movement and Black Lives Matter, to the history and current efforts within the larger LGBTQ+ civil rights movement. Bali: What has your experience been of the larger LGBTQ+ community as a Latino person who is also gay? Erik: As I just mentioned, racism has been a frequent occurrence for me in big cities that don’t have a sizeable number of Latinx people. Other than that, early on, I didn’t realize or appreciate just how broad the LGBTQ+ community was and how many people it included. I’ve been able to change this through my volunteer work with a local Latinx LGBTQ+ civil rights group. Through them, I have been connected to other Latinx organizations and met Latinx individuals who are trans, two-spirit, non-binary, Afro-Latinx LGBTQ+, and disabled LGBTQ+. Bali: What have your experiences been as a Latinx, LGBTQ+ scientist here at the NIH? Erik: As a Latino LGBTQ+ individual at the NIH, the treatment I’ve received has been mostly acceptable. That said, I have had negative experiences in regards to both. I don’t think they have been intentional, but that certainly doesn’t make them acceptable. The one thing that I think allows for such negative experiences at the NIH is the silence around talking about LGBTQ+ individuals, their existence and experiences, as well as the woeful underrepresentation of Latinas/os at the NIH, which currently sits at 4% when Latinas/os are 18.7% of the U.S. population.1 These aspects of NIH culture are the most negative of my experience at the NIH overall. Bali: What are some upcoming events we can participate in as members of the LGBTQ+ and Latinx communities? Erik: Because of the pandemic and other factors, this year’s DC Latinx Pride will be on Friday, October 15, 9:00 pm – 2:00 am ET at The Howard Theatre. This and other Latinx LGBTQ+ events held by LHP can be found on their Facebook page. Sources Do you have a story idea for us? Do you want to submit a guest blog?

> 20/20 Vision: Connecting across our differences. Intersectionality acknowledges the multifaceted aspects of individuals. Our sexual orientation or gender identity alone do not define us; we are a diverse group of people—different ages, races, ethnicities, faiths, and abilities—with many characteristics contributing to our individuality. At the NIH, we take PRIDE in Connecting Across our Differences while becoming more inclusive and respecting all aspects of an individuals’ identity. Sexual or gender minority (SGM) members are simultaneously members of a multitude of other social groups, each adding to that person’s individuality. LGBTQ individuals from the Women, AAPI, Black, and ADA communities voluntarily submitted their profiles intending to boost recognition and awareness of SGM and intersectionality. Learn more about these pioneers who are making great strides in raising LGBTQ awareness and advancing SGM research to guard against misinterpretations and continuing to lead innovations in biomedical research.

Transgender Day of Visibility [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://edi.nih.gov/the-EDI-pulse-blog/transgender-day-visibility)

> Transgender Day of Visibility Wednesday, March 31 marks the 12th Annual International Transgender Day of Visibility (TDOV). The US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) supports the Administration’s policy to prevent and combat discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation, and to fully enforce Title VII and other laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation as envisioned in Executive Order 13985 on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. __ (2020), the Memorandum on Advancing the Human Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex Persons Around the World; and the White House Proclamation on Transgender Day of Visibility, 2021. OPM provides Guidance Regarding the Employment of Transgender Individuals in the Federal Workplace to support Department/Agency efforts in sustaining inclusive cultures. For TDOV 2021, OPM encourages agencies to celebrate the accomplishments and victories of transgender and gender non-conforming individuals around the world; acknowledge the courage it takes to live openly and authentically; and respect the advocates who use this day to raise awareness around the discrimination and violence individuals in the transgender community still face. As this observance is relatively new to the federal workforce, we would like to share a few inclusive practices to jump start your workforce’s inclusion of transgender employees. Attend virtual TDOV events. TDOV is celebrated on a global scale. Research virtual events to participate in and use #TDOV, #TransResistance, or #MoreThanVisibility on social media to share your experience. Revisit history. Did you know transgender individuals have been on the frontlines of our historic movements? Visit the National Park Service’s webpage, “Transgender History in the US and the Places that Matter”. Practice discretion. It may be TDOV, but sometimes transgender individuals do not want to be identified as such or do not feel safe doing so. Always ask first! Learn the terminology. Know the difference between gender identity, gender expression, gender nonbinary, and gender nonconforming. Visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention webpage for a glossary of LGBTQ+ terminology. Recognize the intersection of transness and other identities. This includes race, sexuality, class, disability, citizenship, and more. Recognition does not just entail acknowledgment; it also includes taking action and focusing on the lived experiences of the diversity of the trans community, in particular trans women of color who face the highest rates of discrimination. Engage with your colleagues. Your agency’s HR, diversity and inclusion, or engagement offices should be available to provide information on LGBTQ+ Employee Resource Groups/Affinity Groups. These groups are open to all employees regardless of their gender identity or relationship to the LGBTQ+ community. Be an ally. Use gender neutral language such as “everyone” or “team” instead of “ladies and gentlemen” or “guys.” And consider adding the pronouns with which you best identify in your email signature and permitting your workforce to do the same. Asking and correctly using someone’s pronouns is one of the most basic ways to show your respect for their gender identity. For inquiries regarding LGBTQ+ as it relates to diversity and inclusion programs or to share how your agency practices LGBTQ+ inclusion, contact us at DiversityandInclusion@opm.gov.

> As you prepare for graduate, professional school or job interviews, you may be asked a question related to diversity. Interviewers are very interested in selecting candidates who are aware of and who will contribute to the diversity mission of their organization. Have you practiced how you will answer diversity-related questions? In Career Services, we have seen trainees range in their comfort level about addressing diversity topics. Some trainees have several experiences to answer these questions, that said—many others are unsure how to approach answering the question. In 2014, to recognize Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) Pride month, the OITE Careers Blog published a post addressing job search and work environments for LGBTQ scientists called Happy Pride! This blog issue provides useful resources for scientists, their families, and allies in support of inclusive career decision-making and work environments.

> Happy Pride! Helpful Career Resources for LGBTQ Scientists and Allies In 2014, to recognize Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) Pride month, the OITE Careers Blog published a post addressing job search and work environments for LGBTQ scientists called Happy Pride! This blog issue provides useful resources for scientists, their families, and allies in support of inclusive career decision-making and work environments. LGBTQ Employment and Training Opportunities: In addition to the helpful employment resources referred to in the in the 2014 Happy Pride blog (see above), here are some additional resources: National Organization of Gay and Lesbian Scientists and Technology Professionals (NOGLSTP). A professional association that provides a listing of career opportunities for LGBTQ science and technology graduates, mentoring, fellowships, and other forms of support. New Scientist has published a useful article highlighting LGBT employers in the sciences. GoAbroad.com published an article with links to an excellent on-line LGBT Student Guide to Studying Abroad that provides resources and helpful information that will help LGBT community members prepare to go abroad for studies. The guide is also useful for international applicants seeking knowledge about LGBT safe communities across the world. The Association of International Educators (NAFSA) published an informative article written for allies of LGBTQ international students regarding the specific needs of this population when they arrive to the US and later return to their home countries. PFLAG International extends its advocacy for LGBT individuals and families globally. This is a useful resource for LGBT individuals and allies who are preparing to go abroad for short or extended periods of time. Preferred Gender Pronouns: When applying for internships, jobs, graduate school, and/or professional schools, you may notice a question related to gender pronouns is added. This question allows applicants an option to request their preferred gender pronouns to use when referring to them. Colleges, universities, and human rights organizations provide excellent resources used in ally trainings for students, faculty and staff about using gender neutral pronouns. Ally Training: Many organizations (including the NIH Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion) offer Safe Zone training that can allow allies the opportunity to learn more about the LGBTQ community and assist in the creation of a more welcoming environment. LGBTQ Terminology: One way to contribute to a culture of inclusion and respect for community members is to become aware of accepted terms to refer to members of the LGBTQ community. The human rights organization, PFLAG, publishes a terminology glossary that is a useful reference to learn about the latest acceptable terms. As you can see, it is important for job seekers and their allies to address LGBTQ-related topics in order to keep stress from derailing their life, job search, and/or educational process. The OITE offers career development workshops and/or career, wellness, and pre-professional services. We suggest that you learn when to seek counseling from our office or the NIH Employee Assistance Program. We encourage you to register for the Workplace Dynamics: Diversity in a Multicultural Society workshops and/or join the NIH LGBT Fellows and Friends (LGBT-FF) community. Not at NIH? We recommend using resources offered by your college and university or local community centers. It can be helpful to chat with other professionals who have been through this process to seek advice and support. Out for Work and Out and Equal Workplace Advocates are two good introductory resources.

> Pride Month: Embracing Your Career Journey and Your Authentic Self June is Pride Month, a time dedicated to celebrating the LGBTQ+ community, honoring its history, and recognizing the progress made towards equality. It’s also an opportunity for LGBTQ+ professionals and allies to reflect on their careers and find ways to thrive in their professional lives. Finding Value Alignment at Work One of the most empowering things you can do as an LGBTQ+ professional is to embrace your authentic self. This means bringing your true identity to the workplace, which can significantly enhance your job satisfaction and overall well-being. Companies are increasingly recognizing the value of diversity and inclusion, with many implementing policies to support LGBTQ+ employees. It is important as a job seeker to also seek out organizations that have values that align with your own. Websites like Out & Equal’s Workplace Equality Fact Sheets, Glassdoor’s Diversity & Inclusion page, and LinkedIn’s LGBTQ+ network can provide job search tips, company reviews, and insights into companies’ diversity policies. Check organizational charts for diversity, review non-discrimination or diversity statements from the company, and talk to current or former employees to get a sense of overall culture. An important reminder from Colorado State’s Pride Resource Center: You have agency to make decisions that affirm who you are, protect your boundaries and privacy, and contribute to your sense of safety. The two options of simply being out or being closeted is a false narrative - we make decisions every day for how we navigate living as our authentic selves and our right to privacy based on context, cues, safety, and our energy. Sometimes we want the world to know we’re proud to be queer/trans, and sometimes we don’t want to have to explain ourselves to others. There is fluidity in your decisions and you have the agency to decide what you need – including in employment. Building a Support Network Having a robust support network is crucial for career success. This includes mentors, colleagues, and friends who can offer guidance, advice, and support. Here are some ways to build and strengthen your network: Join LGBTQ+ Professional Organizations: There are numerous organizations dedicated to supporting LGBTQ+ professionals across various industries. Organizations like Out & Equal, The National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC), and Pride at Work provide networking opportunities, resources, and advocacy for LGBTQ+ employees. - Connect with the NIH affinity group LGBT – Fellows and Friends which strives to enhance the environment for LGBTQIA+ scientists at the NIH. - Pride Month is a celebration of identity, courage, and progress. It’s also a reminder of the importance of creating inclusive and supportive environments in all areas of life, including the workplace. By embracing your authentic self, finding value alignment, and building a strong support network, you can not only advance your career but also contribute to a more equitable world. Happy Pride!

Experiences and Inclusion of Sexual and Gender Minority Scientists in the STEM Workforce [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://diversity.nih.gov/disseminate/blog/2021-06-22-experiences-and-inclusion-sexual-and-gender-minority-scientists-stem)

> June is Pride Month, an opportunity to celebrate the various perspectives and experiences of our sexual and gender minority (SGM) colleagues who enhance the mission of NIH. We should also recognize the persistent challenges SGM individuals in the scientific workforce encounter due to systemic inequalities compared to their non-SGM colleagues. SGM populations include, but are not limited to, individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, transgender, Two-Spirit, queer, and/or intersex. Individuals with same-sex or -gender attractions or behaviors and those with a difference in sex development are also included. These populations also encompass those who do not self-identify with one of these terms but whose sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or reproductive development is characterized by non-binary constructs of sexual orientation, gender, and/or sex. The NIH uses the term SGM to be fully inclusive of these diverse populations. In this post, I also use lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) when referring to studies that reflect differences in how researchers defined their samples. Experiences of SGM Scientists Scientists who are LGBTQ are more likely to experience harassment and career obstacles than their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, according to a 2021 survey of over 25,000 scientists, including 1,006 who self-identified as LGBTQ. As I described in our January 2021 Scientific Workforce Diversity newsletter, this survey found LGBTQ professionals were statistically more likely to report limited career opportunities, social marginalization and harassment, and devaluation of professional expertise by colleagues. The LGBTQ respondents were also less likely to be comfortable with the whistleblowing process and more likely to leave STEM careers (Figure 1). Figure 1. Intentions to leave STEM by LGBTQ status. (Source: https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/3/eabe0933) The survey findings are similar to trends observed at six U.S. STEM-related federal agencies and findings from the 2019 NIH Workplace Climate and Harassment Survey. The NIH survey results indicate that individuals who reported having a gender identity other than man or woman, and respondents who identified as bisexual, were more likely to have experienced sexual harassment during the 12 months prior to the survey (Figure 2). Percentage of Each Vulnerable Group Experiencing Sexual Harassment in the Past 12 Months Figure 2. Percentage of Each Vulnerable Group Experiencing Sexual Harassment in the Past 12 Months (Source: NIH Workplace Climate and Harassment Survey) Unwelcoming workplaces mean more than 40 percent of LGBTQ professionals in STEM are not publicly “out” about their sexual orientation and/or gender identity to their colleagues, according to results from a 2013 survey. And most survey respondents could not name a single LGBTQ faculty member at the universities where they got their degrees. The findings suggest a lack of visible representation of SGM role models and mentors for SGM professionals, which may adversely impact careers in science. Institutional support and policies matter, too. The 2013 survey found SGM scientists are less likely to be out at institutions that do not offer same-sex partner benefits or support name changes during a gender transition. Advancing SGM Inclusion and Retention Diversity and inclusion efforts must be supportive and inclusive of all underrepresented groups, including SGM scientists. Despite changing attitudes and progress, the biomedical community needs to do more to address the discrimination and disadvantages SGM individuals face in the scientific workforce and create a welcoming culture. Successful interventions that foster recruitment, retention, and advancement opportunities for SGM scientists include: - Reversing exclusive policies - Countering implicit bias - Facilitating mentoring opportunities - Supporting visibility initiatives - Educating their peers about how to be allies and advocates Research shows that diverse teams encourage greater innovation and creativity because they bring different perspectives to a problem—and we must work to ensure that science contains the voices of SGM scientists. Including a full range of unique and diverse perspectives within the scientific workforce sends the message that all are welcome here. Upcoming Learning Opportunities at NIH The NIH Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) is celebrating Pride Month with the theme Allyship in Action as one of several ways to demonstrate support for our SGM colleagues. EDI will host two webinars on Wednesday, June 23, in celebration of Pride: “Barriers for LGBTQ Scientists” at 1:00 p.m. ET and “A Sexual and Gender Minorities Panel: What Brings Us Here - Experiences and Perspectives from Across the NIH” at 3:00 p.m. ET. In July, a post on this blog will feature an interview with Dr. Karen Parker, Director of the NIH Sexual and Gender Minority Research Office (SGMRO). She’ll discuss SGMRO’s work, the NIH FY 2021–2025 Strategic Plan to Advance Research on the Health and Well-being of Sexual and Gender Minorities, and efforts of the NIH Sexual & Gender Minority Research Coordinating Committee and the NIH Council of Councils Sexual & Gender Minority Research Working Group. Dr. Bernard’s Parting Thoughts The NIH Scientific Workforce Diversity office celebrates and supports diversity in all its forms. We are committed to creating an inclusive scientific workforce where SGM scientists feel welcome and safe and can flourish in their careers. By reducing their barriers to entry and broadening their participation in biomedical science, we ensure a full range of perspectives inform and drive innovation in the field.

> January, 2021 DR. BERNARD'S REFLECTIONS Marie A. Bernard, MD Acting Chief Officer for Scientific Workforce Diversity Every new year provides new opportunities. As we start 2021, and we see the light at the end of the COVID-19 tunnel, there are potentially new pathways forward in diversifying the scientific workforce. Those efforts, of course, should be evidence based. Thus, we share in this month’s issue new data for consideration. We review a reexamination of NIH funding disparities, providing the potential for new approaches. We highlight a new strategic vision for genomic science, with principles for diversification of the workforce that can be generalized to other scientific fields. Finally, we look at recent data highlighting disadvantages of LGBTQ persons in STEM which may offer clues to next steps. Overall, these items contribute to the growing body of information to propel inclusive excellence in the scientific workforce and support the health of all members of our society. Re-Examination of NIH Funding Disparities Demographic disparities in NIH grant funding has been an oft-reported topic since 2011, when Ginther and colleagues found African American and Black (AA/B) scientists were less likely to obtain critical R01 grants—which was corroborated by other reports (Ginther et al., 2016; Hoppe et al., 2019; Erosheva et al., 2020). Active discussions continue about factors that contribute to this disparity, including bias in peer review and grant topic choice—due to recent, related findings (Hoppe et al., 2019). To address this issue, Dr. Michael Lauer, NIH’s Deputy Director for Extramural Research, conducted a re-analysis of the Hoppe data, which suggests the disparity may be attributable to a more influential, yet previously unconsidered factor: differential funding rates of NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) that receive a higher than average proportion of applications from AA/B scientists. While Dr. Lauer’s re-analysis supports the idea that “AA/B-preferred” topics are funded at lower rates, their peer review outcomes are similar to majority peers. Dr. Lauer’s regression analysis found AA/B-preferred topics tend to be assigned to ICs with lower overall award rates. These findings suggest grant topic plays a role, but the ICs they are assigned to play an even larger role. The results are published in a manuscript pre-print. This new piece of evidence adds to the ongoing discussion and shifts the focus to differential IC funding as a potential avenue to pursue to address funding disparities. Advancing Genomics, Health, and the Scientific Workforce The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) published its ambitious strategic vision for the next decade. As a leading authority in the genomics field, NHGRI outlined principles and objectives to address major needs within the field—many of which focus on enhancing diversity within the genomics workforce by 2030. One principle focused on training and genomics workforce development, acknowledging that related initiatives should be intentional in their inclusion of scientists from underrepresented groups and establish incentives to recruit and retain a diverse workforce at all career stages. Other guiding principles focused on striving for diversity in research, which highlighted the need to integrate more ancestrally diverse and underrepresented individuals in major genomic studies to allow genomics to better serve the whole of society. As genomics continues to expand into other fields (e.g., law enforcement), a different principle highlighted the need to be more inclusive of scientific expertise (including basic, translational, social, behavioral, and clinical researchers) to ensure genomics is appropriately applied in all the realms it is used. This may ultimately contribute to demographic diversity as topic choice is associated with demographics (as noted in the section above). Ultimately, as a global leader, NHGRI’s promising set of priorities will be critical to ensuring our society continues to benefit from the ever-expanding use of genomics. Analyses of LGBTQ STEM Inequalities A recent Science publication highlights systemic inequalities reported by Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and/or Queer (LGBTQ) professionals in STEM. Although there is U.S. workforce-wide research on disadvantages for LGBTQ persons, there is a need to account for highly specialized professional contexts, such as those in STEM. To this end, extensive survey data from 21 wide-ranging STEM professional societies captured responses from over 25,000 full-time professionals, including 1,006 who self-identified as LGBTQ. Potential inequalities were examined along several dimensions. For instance, LGBTQ professionals were statistically more likely than their non-LGBTQ peers to report limited career opportunities, social marginalization and harassment, and devaluation of professional expertise by colleagues. Additionally, LGBTQ respondents were less likely to feel comfortable with the whistleblowing process and more likely to consider leaving STEM. Furthermore, supplemental analyses highlighted the extent to which LGBTQ disadvantages varied in an intersectional fashion with other demographic factors. These showed that transgender and gender nonbinary respondents were more likely to report health problems, and LGBTQ-identifying racial/ethnic minorities and women were more likely than their white and male LGBTQ counterparts to experience professional devaluation and harassment at work. Although the survey broke ground with the large number of respondents, one important limitation is that it overrepresents STEM professionals employed in academia and engineering and underrepresents those in computer science. However, the results highlight the overall need for the scientific enterprise to address anti-LGBTQ sentiments and behavior—and encourage the continual inclusion of LGBTQ groups in survey assessments. This can prevent the departure of diverse, skilled talent and promote equity, bolstering the scientific enterprise and STEM innovation.

Most of my current projects are related to HIV prevention and health outcomes for transgender and gender diverse people, as well as developing evidence-based curricula to improve the care environment and clinical outcomes for LGBTQ+ patients. I have been fortunate to collaborate with many of the researchers already profiled by the SGMRO, including Dr. Duncan on the TURNNT (Trying to Understand Relationships, Networks and Neighborhoods among Transgender women of color) study, Dr. Poteat on LITE Plus (examining the relationship between intersectional stigma, stress, and HIV comorbidities among Black and Latina transgender women living with HIV), and Dr. Garofalo on numerous projects, most recently with adapting the MyPEEPs intervention for young transgender men. Q: Tell us about your career path – how did you end up where you are now? A: I grew up on Grenada, a small island in the Caribbean, where I attended medical school, later completing my residency and fellowship in internal medicine and infectious disease at the University of Connecticut. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to study at both the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Cambridge University, where I became interested in health promotion and disease prevention. I returned home to take on the directorship of an insular health department in the Dutch Caribbean, serving in many diverse roles, including clinical lead for the WHO Expanded Program on Immunization, and contributing to communicable disease guidelines. In 2006, I moved to New York City to begin a new role as the associate medical director of the Callen-Lorde Community Health Center, a center that predominately cares for the LGBTQ+ communities and people living with HIV. I realized that more research needed to be done in the area of LGBTQ health, especially research initiated by community-based researchers that centers community needs and research priorities. I decided to study for a Ph.D. in epidemiology at Columbia University, which I completed in 2020. I’m now the director of research and education at Callen-Lorde and started a stand-alone research department that has a robust research portfolio as well as providing evaluation support to other departments in the health center. I am also still involved in teaching, both at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and at Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health, as adjunct faculty. Q: What organizational challenges have you faced? A: Building a research department in a busy federally qualified health center has been challenging, mainly due to competing priorities, specifically the need to allocate most resources to clinical care. Luckily, the health center’s board of directors understands the importance of research to guide clinical practice and they provide substantive support both in terms of time and funding to do this work. Q: What advice do you have for trainees and researchers who want to work in this area or are interested in applying for NIH funding? A: Conducting community-engaged research means that you need to build true sustainable partnerships with community organizations from the very start. You can use their knowledge and expertise to help identify community priorities for research as well as ensure that you implement research that is appropriate and affirming. It’s also very important that their work and contributions are adequately compensated, so be fair and transparent with your budget. Q: Do you have any specific advice for working with and involving SGM populations in research? A: Be aware of your positionality, especially if you are not a member of the SGM community. Having adequate and diverse representation on the research team will be very important to the success of your project, and this may take time to achieve, especially if you are new to working in this area. Also, take care not to underestimate the emotional impact of conducting SGM research on your team, such as exposure to participants’ trauma. Ensuring there is space set aside to debrief will help with team morale and staff retention. Q: Who inspires you? A: I have been incredibly lucky to work with an amazing array of collaborators who have been willing to share their expertise, mentor, and support. I’ve been inspired by so many, including those who are no longer with us. I’d like to specifically name Dr. Judy Bradford, a pioneer in the field of LGBT research, who assisted me with developing one of my first research projects that formed the basis of my Ph.D. dissertation. Q: Any final words of wisdom? A: Doing research within LGBTQ+ communities, especially when you are part of the community, can bring additional challenges and responsibilities. You are expected to wear multiple hats (investigator, advocate, community leader, among others) and if you do not take care of yourself, you may find that you are quickly overwhelmed and in danger of burn-out. Ensure that you build a strong support network, including friends and other SGM researchers, and learn to say no to opportunities that do not bring you joy.

Featured Investigator: Howa Yeung, MD MSc [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/sgmro/featured-investigator-howa-yeung-md-msc)

> June 2024: Howa Yeung, MD, MSc Assistant Professor of Dermatology Emory University School of Medicine Dr. Howa Yeung, MD MSc, is an Assistant Professor of Dermatology at the Emory University School of Medicine. His research focuses on understanding, preventing, and treating skin diseases that disproportionately impact LGBTQ+ populations, such as 1) acne in transgender and gender diverse individuals and 2) skin cancers in gay and bisexual men and persons with HIV. He completed an accelerated BS/MD program at the Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education program, graduating with a BS, summa cum laude, from the City College of New York and an MD from New York University School of Medicine. He completed dermatology residency and an MSc in Clinical Research at Emory University. He is a World Professional Association for Transgender Health Standards of Care Version 8 certified member. He has published >100 peer-reviewed articles and serves as an Associate Editor of JAMA Dermatology. Q: What are your current research interests? A: My background – as an immigrant, Asian American, gay man raised by a working-class family that struggled to access health care in New York City -- motivated me to address health equity in underserved communities. In college, I studied how patient navigators can help racial/ethnic minority patients stop tobacco use (U54 CA137788). In medical school, I studied the effect of psoriasis on cardiometabolic outcomes in a dermato-epidemiology research fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania (T32 AR007465). After my dermatology residency at Emory, I pursued an MSc in Clinical Research (KL2 TR002381) to study skin cancer risk in MSM and persons with HIV. Now, I apply these experiences to studying acne in transgender persons. Q: Tell us about your career path – how did you end up where you are now? A: I am interested in how acne and other hormonal skin diseases develop in transgender and gender diverse persons during gender-affirming testosterone therapy.Our research (K23 AR075888) shows that acne in transgender persons is common, persistent, and impactful to mental health. We are engaging transgender and gender diverse persons and communities to develop a longitudinal cohort on the natural history and treatment of testosterone-induced acne. In understanding testosterone-induced acne during this “second puberty,” as a bonus, I hope we can also spark ideas on how hormones affect the skin and how to address acne in endogenous puberty. Q: What organizational challenges have you faced? A: LGBTQ+ skin health did not exist as a field. Historically, LGBTQ+ health focused on HIV, STI, mental health, and substance use. I had to convince many colleagues and institutional leaders of how skin diseases impact LGBTQ+ health and the importance of health equity in dermatology. As LGBTQ+ health research continued to expand in scope, I found the courage to submit my K23 grant after attending the Building the Next Generation of Academic Physicians (BNGAP) LGBT Health Workforce Conference and finding valuable resources and workshops from NIH SGMRO. Fortunately, NIAMS funded it, one of the first grants to focus on SGM skin health. Q: What advice do you have for trainees and researchers who want to work in this area or are interested in applying for NIH funding? A: Finding the right people is vital. I am grateful to the kind, thoughtful, brave, and generous mentors who supported me for who I am and what I wanted to do: Suephy Chen, Joel Gelfand, Junko Takeshita, Bob Swerlick, Eleni Linos, David Margolis, Vin Tangpricha, Cam Escoffery, Jonathan Weiss, and so many others. They helped me question dogma, hone ideas, push research boundaries, navigate academia, build resilience, and find my professional tribe. They answered my calls asking for help, listened to my challenges, and provided encouragement and reassurance. I am also grateful for my collaborators and trainees who energize me to continue growing. Always continue to listen, learn, and evolve! Q: Do you have any specific advice for working with and involving SGM populations in research? A: Partnering with LGBTQ+ communities warrants researchers’ time, budget, resources, and expertise. Listening to community members’ lived experiences and concerns will enrich your research, build further collaborations, and help structure your priorities. Also, mentoring, hiring, and supporting LGBTQ+ researchers are critical to sustaining SGM health equity research. SGM health has made tremendous strides over the last few decades, but we must expand the pipeline of researchers to continue the progress. Q: Who inspires you? A: Immigrants, like my parents, who forged new futures for their families through hope, grit, and love. Community advocates who fought to be seen and heard and for SGM health to exist. Clinicians, scientists, and public health professionals who strive to keep people healthy regardless of backlash, especially during the HIV and COVID-19 pandemics. Q: Any final words of wisdom? A: When we submit a grant, our lab celebrates with a mini bottle of champagne wrapped in the Specific Aims page. However you celebrate, take a moment to reflect on your accomplishments and acknowledge your colleagues. Those moments will propel you to keep dreaming and achieving!

Featured Investigator: José A. Bauermeister, MPH, PhD [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/sgmro/featured-investigator-jose-bauermeister-mph-phd-0)

> April 2023: José A. Bauermeister, MPH, PhD Albert M. Greenfield University Professor of Human Relations Faculty Director, Eidos LGBTQ+ Health Initiative at the University of Pennsylvania Chair, Department of Family & Community Health, School of Nursing, University of Pennsylvania José Bauermeister is the Founding Faculty Director of the Eidos LGBTQ+ Health Initiative at the University of Pennsylvania. He is also the Albert M. Greenfield University Professor of Human Relations, Chair of the Department of Family and Community Health in the School Nursing and Psychiatry at the Perelman School of Medicine. José is an Aspen Institute’s Health Innovators Fellow, and a member of the Aspen Global Leadership Network. José received his bachelor's degree from the University of Puerto Rico, and his graduate degrees in public health from the University of Michigan. His work focuses on synergizing systems-level interventions, community engagement, digital strategies, and clinical innovations to optimize the health and well-being of LGBTQ+ communities. Over the past 20 years, Jose has conducted extensive research on the unique health challenges faced by sexual and gender minority communities. Currently, José is lead investigator of several clinical trials, including a digital life skills program for sexual minority adolescent men, and a social support platform focused on addressing stigma for Black and Latinx sexual and gender minority adolescents and young adults. José has led projects funded by the NIH, CDC, Ford Foundation, MAC AIDS Fund, HopeLab, and Herb Ritts Foundation. He has published over 250 peer-reviewed publications. José is a member of the NIH Sexual and Gender Minority Research Working Group and served as a co-author of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine consensus report: Measuring Sex, Gender Identity, and Sexual Orientation. He is a member of the editorial boards of the American Journal of Community Psychology, Journal of Community Psychology, Archives of Sexual Behavior, AIDS Education & Prevention, Annals of LGBTQ Public and Population Health, and Journal of Youth & Adolescence. Q: What are your current research interests? A: I have focused a large portion of my career thinking about the holistic well-being of sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth, particularly as it relates to HIV/STI prevention and care. My current research is fueled by a desire to embed humanistic frameworks within intervention research, with the goal of creating both behaviorally congruent and developmentally enriching programs for SGM adolescents and young adults. For example, how might digital interventions designed to promote life skills for SGM youth help improve their social, interpersonal, psychological, and physical well-being? What resources and supports need to be available in SGM youth’s communities for them to enact what they are learning online? In order to answer these types of questions, I have become deeply invested in creating opportunities to engage and involve SGM youth throughout the design, implementation, and evaluation of my research. Q: Tell us about your career path – how did you end up where you are now? A: I got my bachelor’s in psychology at the University of Puerto Rico – Mayagüez for my undergraduate degree. I had the amazing fortune of participating as a research assistant in an applied community psychology lab led by Dr. Milagritos Gonzalez-Rivera focused on stigma among people living with HIV, and a subsequent summer internship during my junior year with Dr. Alex Carballo-Diéguez at the HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies at Columbia University. These experiences really opened my eyes to applied health research and to the field of public health in general. After graduating, I decided to pursue a combined MPH/PhD in Health Behavior & Health Education where I focused my research on correlates of risk and resilience among youth, working in Dr. Marc Zimmerman’s research lab at the University of Michigan. After completing my PhD, I went back to the HIV Center to complete a two-year postdoctoral fellowship and subsequently joined the faculty at the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health. As a faculty member, I felt deeply committed to create a research learning environment similar to what my amazing mentors had given me; so, I decided to start a research lab focused on Sexuality & Health (SexLab for short) which eventually grew into a research center (the Center for Sexuality & Health Disparities) that was co-housed between the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health and School of Nursing. After a few years, I was recruited by Dean Antonia Villarruel to join the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Nursing where I have been now for over 7 years. Here, I created a research lab focused on participatory action research and its role in addressing health disparities through technology (PSTAR: the Program on Sexuality, Technology and Action Research). PSTAR has evolved into a university-wide initiative focused on SGM Health (The Eidos LGBTQ+ Health Initiative; www.penneidos.org) where we bring together social enterprise, education, research, and community resources to create real-world applications that can advance LGBTQ+ health equity. Q: What organizational challenges have you faced? A: We have come a long way in advancing the SGM health agenda. When I started my career, we didn’t have access to consensus reports regarding the state of the science or the policy priorities recommendations to advance SGM health. I had to spend a lot of time persuading my peers that a research career focused on SGM health was viable. At the time, some of my senior colleagues expressed concerns that centering my research on SGM health could be risky for my professional advancement as funding opportunities were limited. Thankfully, as SGM health science has become more prominent, efforts to advance SGM health have grown exponentially. Nevertheless, there is still much to do! It remains vital that we continue to invest in inclusive scholarship where diverse perspectives on SGM health can be discussed and analyzed. Q: What advice do you have for trainees and researchers who want to work in this area or are interested in applying for NIH funding? A: My best advice for folks interested in applying for NIH funding related to SGM health is to be passionate about your ideas, and allow these ideas to evolve once you receive reviewer feedback. The grant process is highly competitive (we have all gone unscored or unfunded at some time in our careers); however, your chances of success will increase if you are able to ground your ideas in a sound scientific premise, ensure that what you are proposing is feasible within a given funding mechanism, and be responsive to reviewers’ comments. This may take a few submissions and resubmissions, so don’t give up! Q: Who inspires you? A: Generally, I’m inspired by people who go out of their way to create opportunities for other people. I’ve deeply benefited from this kindness. I’m so grateful to have crossed paths with scientists who were willing to support my personal and professional growth, and who have created space for me to explore my ideas through research. I really try to pay it forward to the best of my ability, whether it’s having a brief call to explore someone’s ideas or by creating a pipeline for the next generation of scientists through applied research opportunities.

> Featured Investigator: Tara McKay March 2024: Tara McKay, PhD Assistant Professor, Department of Medicine, Health & Society Assistant Professor, Department of Health Policy (secondary) Associate Director, Vanderbilt Center for Research on Inequality and Health Associate Director, Vanderbilt LGBTQ+ Policy Lab Vanderbilt University Tara McKay is Assistant Professor of Medicine, Health, and Society and affiliated faculty in the Sociology Department at Vanderbilt University. She received a BA in Psychology from Occidental College and MA and PhD in Sociology from the University of California, Los Angeles. Before joining MHS, Tara was a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Scholar in Health Policy Research at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of California, San Francisco. Her research and teaching interests include medical sociology, gender and sexualities, global health, and health policy. In much of her work, Tara has addressed the social, political and economic contexts that shape health and health policy with a focus on vulnerable populations in the US and Africa. Her interests in health, sexuality, and policy have prompted studies of: global AIDS policy formation; the role of clinical trials in providing access to basic health care for a subset of the US population; substance use, sexual identity formation and community membership among young African American and Latino gay men in the US; doctor-patient interactions in HIV/AIDS care in the US; relationship-level dynamics among HIV positive bisexual men. Recently, she has also begun two new projects examining how the Affordable Care Act will affect communities and how social networks affect health among older LGBT populations. Her research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the American Council for Learned Societies, among others, and has been featured in Social Science & Medicine, American Journal of Public Health, Culture, Health & Sexuality, AIDS & Behavior. Q: What are your current research interests? A: I am the PI of the Vanderbilt University Social Networks Aging and Policy Study (VUSNAPS). This study is funded by National Institute on Aging. VUSNAPS is a cohort study of LGBTQ+ midlife and older adults aged 50 to 76. We began recruitment in 2020 in four southern states: Tennessee, Alabama, North Carolina, and Georgia. The goals of this project are to examine how social networks and policy contexts might exacerbate or buffer the harms of stressful, negative life events LGBTQ+ older adults experience. We now have three waves of survey data and biomarker data for this population, which is very exciting. We are also about to begin collecting objective cognitive functioning the data for this sample. The VUSNAPS study collects such rich data on the aging, health, and life course trajectories of midlife and older LGBTQ+ adults that aren’t collected by other data products out there, which is very exciting and opens a lot of opportunities for expanding research on LGBTQ+ aging. I have ongoing projects looking at drivers of LGBTQ+ disparities in sleep quality, accelerated biological aging, and the effects of having LGBTQ+ affirming healthcare on uptake of preventive care. There are so many opportunities with this sample. Deidentified Wave 1 data are currently available on request and will be available as public use this year. Q: What organizational challenges have you faced? A: Doing this work from a more conservative state is often challenging but is also can be very rewarding. Many LGBTQ+ folks in our sample are thriving in Tennessee and across the South despite a host of anti-LGBTQ bills from the legislature. I hope this work will help shine a light on things like the importance of expanding access to LGBTQ+ affirming care, which we find is associated with better healthcare outcomes for LGBTQ adults. Additionally, we can show how LGBTQ older adults have built lives and social support structures that enable them to thrive despite hostile policy environments. We have used this work to work with the mayor's office and other nonprofit and healthcare organizations that want to improve their service provision to LGBTQ older adults in the South. Q: What advice do you have for trainees and researchers who want to work in this area or are interested in applying for NIH funding? A: It's really important in for folks working in this space, especially from more conservative states, to find your community. One thing that we have prioritized at Vanderbilt is building that community through the creation of the Vanderbilt LGBTQ+ Policy Lab. The LGBTQ+ Policy Lab supports trainees and faculty working in this space and provides and intellectual community to engage around project troubleshooting and funding challenges. We come together to provide support in the face of hostile state politics and to celebrate each other’s achievements. This space didn’t always exist. We had to build it. And it has grown from three people and a piece of paper to a thriving center with dedicated space, funded trainee lines, and immense institutional support. The LGBTQ+ Policy Lab was recently recognized by NIH as one of the inaugural winners of the NIH DEIA Prize for promoting diversity and inclusion in health research through our training and retention of LGBTQ+ health researchers.

Her research, teaching, and clinical practice focus on HIV and LGBTQ health with particular attention to the role of intersectional stigma in driving health disparities. Certified as an HIV Specialist by the American Academy of HIV Medicine, she is a global leader in HIV research and care with transgender persons. In 2019, she was named to the National Academies of Science Consensus Panel on the Well-being of Sexual and Gender Minorities. She has published numerous articles on HIV among transgender adults. She is an Associate Editor for the journal, LGBT Health and served as a guest editor for a special issue of the Journal of the International AIDS Society on HIV among transgender populations. Q: What are your current research interests? A: I am interested in research that addresses the intersectional and structural stigma that drives LGBTQ health disparities with a particular focus on the health and well-being of transgender communities. Q: Tell us about your career path – how did you end up where you are now? A: I’ve had a meandering path! My career began with a strong interest in direct medical care. I completed the Emory University Physician Assistant Program in 1995, and I’ve been providing medical care for LGBTQ communities and people living with HIV ever since. Over the years, I became increasingly interested in public health. I worked in global HIV programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for several years and completed an MPH in Behavioral Science at Rollins School of Public Health in 2007. In 2012, I completed a Ph.D. in International Health from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and went back to working in global HIV programs at the Office of the US Global AIDS Coordinator. While there, I realized how little data existed on the health of LGBTQ people, especially outside the U.S., and I wanted to change that. So, I returned to Johns Hopkins in 2014 where I was core faculty in the Center for Public Health and Human Rights and began my research career in both international and U.S.-based LGBTQ health research. In 2018, I moved to NC to be closer to my family, and I’ve been at UNC-CH ever since. While I’m no longer a full-time clinician, I continue to provide medical care in the HIV clinic at UNC, and I mentor medical students at the local free clinic in the provision of gender-affirming medical care. Q: What organizational challenges have you faced? A: As one of the earlier researchers in transgender health, it was initially hard to get funders to pay attention to the unique research needs of this community. I’m happy to see that has changed with time and lots of advocacy by many people over the years. Q: What advice do you have for trainees and researchers who want to work in this area or are interested in applying for NIH funding? A: I recommend always engaging and partnering with community members and/or community organizations. They can help guide your research so that you are addressing issues that really matter to the people most affected by them. As for NIH funding, finding mentors with experience writing NIH grants and time to provide detailed feedback is invaluable. And persist! It can take multiple submissions before you get funding, but if you believe in your project, don’t give up. Q: Do you have any specific advice for working with and involving SGM populations in research? A: Be trustworthy, dependable, and truly care about the people involved in your research studies. It will come through in your work and make it better. Q: Who inspires you? A: In the research world, I am deeply inspired by the work of Lisa Bowleg and the work of Nancy Krieger. In the non-research world, my mother inspires me to continue to grow and learn and do my part to build a better future. Q: Any final words of wisdom? A: Take some breaks and have some fun. Work is much more gratifying when you return to it after some rest and rejuvenation.

Insights and Injustice: Identity-Driven Perceptions of Resilience Against Natural, Built and Social Hazards in the Eastern Caribbean [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/isee.2020.virtual.P-0348)

> ISEE 2020 Virtual Conference: 32nd Annual Conference of the International Society of Environmental Epidemiology Insights and Injustice: Identity-Driven Perceptions of Resilience Against Natural, Built and Social Hazards in the Eastern Caribbean Publication: ISEE Conference Abstracts Volume 2020, Issue 1 Abstract Human health is inextricably linked to natural, built and social environs. Under the threat of climate change impacts, residents of Eastern Caribbean small island developing states (ECSIDS) are particularly susceptible to environmental factors, many of which may interact with vulnerable identities to yield or exacerbate poor health. This study evaluated views around various health aspects among St. Kitts & Nevis (SKN) residents, ages 15 to 75, from 2015 to 2019. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to assess the likelihood of perceived resilience and vulnerability. Non-LGBTQ+ individuals were more likely than LGBTQ+ residents to perceive storm impacts in their communities (OR: 2.45; 95%CI: 1.11, 5.09), and had worse post-storm access to electricity (OR: 2.06; 95%CI: 1.02, 4.00) and worse post-storm waste management (OR: 2.05; 95%CI: 1.12, 3.70). LGBTQ+ residents more so than non-LGBTQ+ persons, considered water quality to be worse after a storm (OR:2.45; 95%CI: 1.11, 5.09). Non-LGBTQ+ residents were, relative to LGBTQ+ individuals, (a) less likely to perceive residential areas (OR: 0.46, 95%CI: 0.26, 0.83) and (b) more likely to perceive occupational settings (OR: 2.75; 95%CI: 1.54, 5.00) as being in worse conditions after a storm. Persons at least thirty years old had higher odds, compared to younger persons, of perceiving a decline in the condition of residential areas after storm activity (OR: 2.37; 95%CI: 1.53, 3.69), and viewing quality of transportation as worse post-storm (OR: 1.60; 95%CI: 1.07, 2.42). Health status (morbidity) did significantly influence how participants reported their own resilience when faced with various hazards. Findings have implications for how identity shapes climate change vulnerability and perceptions, thus supporting the rationale for further research into the resilience of potentially marginalized communities.

> 2022 Mental Health Essay Contest Awardee: Honorable Mention Don't Say Hope: Why Don't Say Gay Bills Are a National Mental Health Crisis Leila, Ohio On March 28th, 2022, I opened Instagram on my bus ride to school and was confronted with an image of Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida signing HB 1557–the Don’t Say Gay Bill–into law. I remember feeling my stomach drop and being pulled into a whirlwind of emotion. I couldn’t believe that so many people had approved of this bill that it actually was becoming law, and I was beyond angry that DeSantis and the other adults in power in Florida could be so insensitive and ignorant. But above all else, I felt a deep sense of heartache for Florida’s children. Among other things, the Don’t Say Gay Bill prohibits the instruction of sexual orientation and gender identity in schools from grades K-3. While this bill primarily targets the first 4 years of school, it also states that the bill covers all discussion of LGBTQ topics that are not deemed age-appropriate. Therefore, this bill essentially has the potential to severely affect children’s mental health throughout all grades of school. As someone who realized they were queer at a very young age, hearing about this bill being signed into law struck a chord with me. Throughout my childhood, LGBTQ topics were rarely ever discussed. When I started having feelings for other girls, I was about 9 years old. I felt genuinely disgusted at myself. I was anxious and scared about what liking girls would mean for my future. I knew what the words gay and lesbian meant, but I didn’t know that there were any other options. I knew that certain people weren’t straight, but I never thought that I could be one of “them.” Queerness was taboo in my childhood, and it took me years to become fully accepting of my own LGBTQ identity. In 7th grade, I transferred into a Catholic school. I had become much more open about speaking about my experiences as a lesbian by that point, but my new school’s environment was very difficult for me to navigate. On the best days, the teachers at the school were silent about LGBTQ topics in the classroom. On the worst days, my classmates were outwardly homophobic and no administrative steps were taken to change their behavior. My newfound confidence in my identity as a queer person was met by rumors, judgment, and hate speech from my cishet peers, and I had little support from the school in that aspect of my life. My mental health dropped considerably after I started going there, and I began to experience depression for the first time in my life. Eventually, I wrote an essay to my principal proposing that I start a Junior High Gay-Straight Alliance as a measure to build community and to take action against homophobia and transphobia in the school. I was immediately shot down and told that LGBTQ topics were not to be discussed in K-8 schools and that the school can’t sanction anything that’s centered on sex. To this day, I can’t remember a time when I felt as isolated and dismissed as I did at that moment. I was 13 years old. I wasn’t trying to indoctrinate anyone or introduce sexuality to young children. I was trying to carve a safe space for myself and other queer students in the oppressive landscape of a Catholic school. When politicians spit phrases like “keeping our children safe” and “making sure education is age-appropriate,” I’m taken straight back to one of the darkest moments of my life. I was very lucky to have a small support system of family and friends at the school, but many children are not that fortunate. Even with the assets I had, I still found myself losing my sense of purpose and joy in school. My mental health spiraled further and further, and it undeniably would have been even more impacted had I not had my own support system. The Don’t Say Gay Bill doesn’t just mean LGBTQ issues can’t be a part of formal education in schools. It means young queer students and children of LGBTQ parents are being taught that their identities are something to whisper about, to be ashamed of. It means straight and cisgender students aren’t being educated on how to respect other people. It doesn’t just mean “don’t say gay,” it means don’t say love and family can look many different ways. It means don’t say dignity for trans and gender non-conforming youth who simply want to be addressed correctly. It means don’t say hope for children like me, who couldn’t see a light at the end of the tunnel. At the end of the day, Florida’s Don’t Say Gay Bill is not simply a political tactic. It is a national mental health crisis. Since I started high school in an LGBTQ-accepting school where LGBTQ issues are discussed and anti-discrimination measures are taken, my depression has decreased significantly. I’m excited to go to school again, and I feel a weight lifted off my shoulders for the first time in years. I still have moments of depression and anxiety from time to time, but I’ve been able to develop healthy coping mechanisms with support from my community. My experience is just one story, but it’s a story that has told itself over and over throughout the years. According to GLSEN’s 2019 National School Climate Survey, “access to an inclusive curriculum was related to greater feelings of school belonging, higher self-esteem, and lower depression among the LGBTQ students.” Queer children deserve to feel safe and heard for who they are and to have access to the same mental health support as their cishet peers. The first step in this direction is ensuring that school environments foster education about diversity. Legislative action needs to be taken in order to truly protect children in schools–not from some LGBTQ agenda, but from a never-ending loop of silence that fosters misinformation and anti-LGBTQ sentiment and breeds mental health issues in students. NIH recognizes these talented essay winners for their thoughtfulness and creativity in addressing youth mental health. These essays are written in the students' own words, are unedited, and do not necessarily represent the views of NIH, HHS, or the federal government. Page updated September 20, 2022

> A Message from the Strategist Why Understanding Intersectionality Is Critical [M]any of the battles we’re fighting today are problems that grow out of intersectional failures from yesterday. So, my hope—I believe a collective hope…is that this concept can help us provide a prism to find some of those failures, to repair those failures, and to create a basis for a far broader, deeper, more robust coalition towards the kind of world [workplace] we want to build. -- Kimberlé Crenshaw, Women of the World Festival, London, 2016 The Lavender Scare’s dismissal of so many Federal workers, the daily oppressions that led to the Stonewall Uprising, the ways the HIV/AIDS crisis ravaged so many lives and the violence trans women of color now continue to face daily, these are some of the “failures” of which Dr. Crenshaw refers. The framework for the discussion this month is recognizing the intersection of being a member of the LGBTQ+ community as well as having other lived experiences based around race, class, disability, citizenship, and more. Beyond the singular, it is the combination of these multiple, overlapping identities that create unique challenges that are much more complex, and that must be acknowledged as we create the tools and resources to create a safe environment that ensures everyone is secure.

Intersectional Voices: New Pride Perspectives Intersectional Voices: Revisiting Past Perspectives Take a moment to read and view these previously published EDI blogs and our special campaign, “Telling Our Stories,” that underscore intersectionality. Resources for Better Understanding LGBTQIA+ People LGBT Identification in U.S. Ticks Up to 7.1%1 The proportion of U.S. adults who consider themselves to be lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender has grown at a faster pace over the past year than in prior years. This is occurring as more of Gen Z is reaching adulthood. These young adults are coming of age, including coming to terms with their sexuality or gender identity, at a time when Americans increasingly accept gays, lesbians and transgender people, and LGBT individuals enjoy increasing legal protection against discrimination. Given the large disparities in LGBT identification between younger and older generations of Americans, the proportion of all Americans who identify as LGBT can be expected to grow in the future as younger generations will constitute a larger share of the total U.S. adult population. With one in 10 millennials and one in five Gen Z members identifying as LGBT, the proportion of LGBT Americans should exceed 10% in the near future.

> Intervention IP-082: Proud and Empowered! (P&E) Summary The Proud & Empowered intervention, a school-based intervention, helps sexual and gender minority students cope with minority stress experiences that ultimately impact mental health outcomes in this population. Students at four schools were recruited to participant in the study and the intervention (vs. control) was randomly-assigned at the school level. Students who received the intervention vs. control showed reductions in minority stress (i.e., internalized homonegativity) from pre-to-post intervention and changes in mental health outcomes. Overview To reduce the impacts of minority stress among LGBTQ+ youth with the goal of improving mental health, health disparities and social support Research-Tested — Interventions with strong methodological rigor that have demonstrated short-term or long-term positive effects on one or more targeted health outcomes to improve minority health and/or health disparities through quantitative measures; Studies have a control or comparison group and are published in a peer-review journal; No pilot, demonstration or feasibility studies.

Moderation analyses showed that the intervention significantly moderated the relationship between minority stress and PTSD (b = -1.28, p = .032), depression (b = -0.79, p = .023), and suicidality (b = 0.14, p = .012) symptoms; those in the intervention condition had mitigated relationships between measures of stress and health outcomes compared to those in the control condition. Preliminary analyses ensured no group differences at Time 1. A two-by-two repeated-measures ANOVA assessed intervention and control group changes between pre-test and post-test in minority stress, subscales, and mental health (anxiety, depression, PTSD, suicidality). Subsequent regression analyses tested whether intervention was a moderator in the relationship between minority stress and Time 2 mental health symptoms, controlling for Time 1 symptoms; analyses run for each mental health outcome Evaluations and Assessments No Demographic and Implementation Description Environmental Exposures, Skin cutting, Suicide, Depression, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, Substance Use/Abuse African American or Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, White, Unspecified Racial and Ethnic Minority Populations, Sexual and Gender Minority (SGM) Groups Adolescents (10 - 17 years) Socio-demographics / Population Characteristics Suburban, Urban / Inner City Unspecified Female, Male, Non-binary, Transgender, Unspecified, Participants must self-identify as non-heterosexual and/or non-cisgender.

> On this page: Major Changes | Frequently Asked Questions Major Changes Are Here! On July 31, 2023, the NIH implemented the changes outlined in the recently revised FDA Guidance that recommends the adoption of Individual Donor Assessment (IDA) to determine blood donor eligibility. The finalized guidance poses the same donor screening questions to every donor, regardless of gender or sexual orientation. This change is the result of a multi-year research process informed by data from Canada and the United Kingdom, surveillance information from the Transfusion Transmissible Infections Monitoring System (TTIMS), data assessing performance characteristics of nucleic acid testing for HIV, and results from the FDA-funded ADVANCE study. The NIH Blood Bank fully supports this important step towards inclusivity, one which will allow more individuals to safely contribute to the vital cause of blood donation. Our top priority is the safety of our volunteer blood donors and the patients in need of lifesaving blood products. We look forward to welcoming new blood donors! Frequently Asked Questions Can I donate if I am a man who has sex with men? The FDA recently revised blood donor eligibility criteria in recent guidance document. Based on review of the available science, FDA recommends eliminating the screening questions specific to men who have sex with men (MSM) and women who have sex with MSM. Instead, FDA recommends assessing donor eligibility using the same individual risk-based questions relevant to HIV risk for every donor regardless of sex or gender. Can I donate if I identify as transgender or non-binary? Effective November 15, 2023, donors may select male (M), female (F) or other (X) designation in our computer system. We welcome blood donations from eligible donors regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. Donors who were previously registered as M or F may change their designation if desired; please speak with a donor resources specialist to make this change. Why do we ask blood donors about sex and gender? In the past, the donor health history questionnaire was gender-specific; blood donors were asked different questions based on their self-reported sex. Effective July 31, 2023, the NIH Blood Bank implemented the changes outlined in the recently revised FDA Guidance that recommends the adoption of Individual Donor Assessment (IDA) to determine blood donor eligibility. The finalized guidance poses the same donor screening questions to every donor, regardless of gender or sexual orientation. However, certain aspects of the donor safety evaluation are based on criteria derived from historical sex-specific data, namely hemoglobin determination and estimation of blood volume for apheresis procedures. Hemoglobin (Hb) is the substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen to tissues in the body. The minimum Hb threshold per FDA criteria is higher for males (13.0 g/dL) than females (12.5 g/dL). Drawing blood from donors with a low Hb may be unsafe for them. Blood volume estimation calculations are important for a procedure called double red cell apheresis, which removes twice as many red cells as a routine blood donation. Estimated blood volume is larger for males than females. Drawing too much blood from donors with smaller blood volumes may be unsafe for them. To optimize donor safety, our policy is as follows: - For donors who self-identify as female, minimum Hb ≥ 12.5 g/dL, smaller estimated blood volume criteria - For donors who self-identify as male, minimum Hb ≥ 13.0 g/dL and larger estimated blood volume criteria - For donors who do not identify as male or female, we utilize the criteria with the lowest risk, i.e., minimum Hb ≥ 13.0 g/dL and smaller estimated blood volume criteria. If you have any questions, please speak with a donor resources specialist, or ask to speak with a physician.

Voices from the Field: Including LGBTQ+ Health Equity in Climate and Health [[Wayback Machine]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/programs/geh/geh_newsletter/2021/10/training/voices_from_the_field_including_lgbtq_health_equity_in_climate_and_health)

> By Leo Goldsmith My path to working in climate and health was like a winding river; I was always being pulled in different directions. My variety of interests spanned several fields, and it proved difficult to decide what I wanted to be the focus of my research and career. In parallel, I was taking a similar path in figuring out my sexual orientation and gender identity. It took a lot of reflection, great mentors, and inspiring trail blazers before it became apparent that all those twists and turns were heading in the same direction. I have since dedicated my work on the disproportionate impacts of climate change on populations who are marginalized, especially those who are sexual and gender minorities. During my undergraduate time at Oberlin College, the science I was learning during my pre-med track was devoid of equity and social issues. Searching for more, I pursued environmental studies with an environmental justice focus. After graduating, I spent a year conducting ecological restoration and community engagement at a New York City park in Upper Manhattan. During this time, I came out as a queer, transgender man and due to limited job prospects, applied to the Yale School of the Environment. I was accepted and had opportunities to conduct tropical ecology research in Panama, consult on environmental justice indicators and mapping for the state of Connecticut, and became an Environmental Fellow under Dorceta Taylor, Ph.D. Throughout my studies, it became clear that there was little research on how climate change impacts the health and well-being of sexual and gender minorities. One of my professors at the time, Michael Mendez, Ph.D., currently an assistant professor at University of California, Irvine, proposed a collaboration for a research paper on climate change and LGBTQ+ populations based on a final paper I wrote for his class. We co-created a workshop at the school on the subject that later was used as input on policy recommendations in the recently published paper Queer and Present Danger: Understanding the Disparate Impacts of Disasters on LGBTQ+ Communities in the Disasters journal. Through our research and alongside Vanessa Raditz, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Georgia, we found that LGBTQ+ communities are disproportionately impacted by disasters, such as hurricanes and wildfires. The reasons are existing socioeconomic and health inequities, lack of cultural competence in health and housing, and inequitable disaster response and emergency preparedness policies. Within the LGBTQ+ community, those at most risk include Black and indigenous individuals, older adults, incarcerated people, youth, and transgender individuals. Currently, I am the climate and health specialist for the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), coordinating the Interagency Crosscutting Group on Climate Change and Human Health (CCHHG). The working group coordinates, implements, evaluates, and communicates federal research and scientific activities related to the human health impacts of global climate change. We create tools for local and state health departments, and work across many themes such as food and nutrition, zoonotic and infectious diseases, extreme heat, and water-borne illnesses both domestically and abroad. I feel very lucky to be involved and proximate to the immense amount of knowledge, passion, and hard work I am surrounded by daily. With the establishment of the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity within HHS, there will now be an even larger focus on communities that are historically marginalized within climate and health activities. Although my work is not specifically focused on sexual and gender minorities, the activities and research that come from the working group are meant to help all who may experience health impacts from climate change. Moreover, this has been a workplace where I feel that I can be myself in every facet of who I am. I hope by doing so, I can inspire others to embrace and nurture intersectionality within themselves and their passions.
