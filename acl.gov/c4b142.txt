Researchers at Emory University Goizueta Alzheimer's Disease Research Center are gathering data on diverse LGBTQ caregivers in order to discover the unique obstacles they face in their role. The goal of this project is to learn more about what resources make this role easier, as well as to develop a caregiver training program to address the challenges faced by LGBTQ informal caregivers of people living with dementia. Researchers are looking for participants who are: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender - 18 or older - Consider themselves a primary caregiver for another adult person - Participants do not have to live with the person they care for or care for them full-time, and they may also be eligible if they were an informal caregiver in the past. Those who are eligible to participate will be asked to complete a 60-minute questionnaire about their medical history, sleep patterns, mood, diet and exercise, stress, and caregiver experiences. If the person they are caring for is a person living with dementia, we would also like to ask them to participate in the clinical trial portion of our study. The clinical trial involves watching four instructional videos that teach a caregiver mastery course, followed by discussion questionnaires and a focus group.
