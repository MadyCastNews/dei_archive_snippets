Creation of the Vanderbilt LGBTQ+ Policy Lab The Vanderbilt LGBTQ+ Policy Lab is an institution-wide intervention that advances the goals of the NIH Institutional Excellence in DEIA in Biomedical and Behavioral Research Prize Competition. By describing specific and replicable interventions that have tangibly improved the culture around inclusion of sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals at this institution, this lab hopes to help other institutions adopt and adapt similar models that can be effective across a range of institutional contexts and DEIA target populations.
