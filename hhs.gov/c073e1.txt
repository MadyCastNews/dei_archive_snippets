May 2012Vol. 13 No. 4LGBTQ Cultural Competency Assessment The National Center for Cultural Competence at Georgetown University Center for Child and Human Development recently posted a self-assessment checklist designed to raise service providers' awareness and sensitivity when working with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning (LGBTQ) youth and their families. The checklist is composed of three sections: Physical environment, materials, and resources - Communication practices - Values and attitudes - For each self-assessment statement, the provider answers A (I do this frequently), B (I do this occasionally), or C (I do this rarely or never). While there is no answer key, the National Center for Cultural Competence suggests that if a provider answers with mostly C's, he or she needs to try implementing practices that are more culturally competent, creating a safe and welcoming environment for LGBTQ youth and their families. Self-Assessment Checklist for Personnel Providing Services and Supports to LGBTQ Youth and Their Families is available on the National Center for Cultural Competence's website: http://nccc.georgetown.edu/documents/Final%20LGBTQ%20Checklist.pdf (53 KB)
