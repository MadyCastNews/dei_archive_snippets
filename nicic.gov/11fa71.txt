This Beginner’s Guide is intended to simplify this research process, and provide some helpful resources for those interested in the law surrounding gender identity and sexual orientation. While the legal issues surrounding gender identity and sexual orientation are frequently talked about as if they fall into a singular category, they involve multiple areas of law, including family law, employment law, immigration law, juvenile law, tax law, and health law, among many others. Thus, it can be difficult to find resources that touch on all or most of these areas. This Beginner’s Guide includes information about how to research legal issues that affect LGBTQ+ people.
