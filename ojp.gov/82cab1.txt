NCJ Number 239809 Date Published September 2012 Length 16 pages Annotation This bibliography provides summaries and links to articles that explore sexual violence against individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ). Abstract The articles, reports, and films listed in the bibliography explore sexual violence against individuals who identify as LGBTQ from a variety of angles, including lifetime sexual victimization, intimate partner violence, sexual violence as hate/bias crimes, and service provisions for survivors. The research examined indicates that sexual violence is an important concern for individuals and communities who identify as LGBTQ. Individuals who identify as LGBTQ appear to be at higher risk for sexual victimization than the general population, and may encounter barriers to services because of homophobia and transphobia. Intersections between various forms of oppression may exacerbate these challenges, making it important to address LGBTQ sexual victimization alongside sexism, racism, ableism, and other variables.
