June is Pride Month and the theme allows us to reflect on the contributions of the LGBTQ+ community in the workforce and society. This observance month also allows us to highlight the health care challenges and barriers LGBTQ+ individuals experience within the health care system to receive culturally and clinically competent care. On June 24 at 1 p.m. ET, Dr. Michael Kauth and Dr. Jillian C. Shipherd, both directors of the VA LGBTQ+ Health Program, will deliver the presentation Treating the Unique Health Care Needs of Veterans with Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Related Identities. Presenters will share how to recognize the health needs and disparities experienced by LGBTQ+ Veterans. They also will discuss why and how to ask patients about their birth sex, gender identity and sexual orientation. They’ll share strategies for creating a more welcoming practice for LGBTQ+ Veteran patients that you can incorporate into your treatment approach.
